  abstract = {{We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper
              coverage frequency. Several types of evidence—including human readings of 12,000
              newspaper articles—indicate that our index proxies for movements in
              policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight
              presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of
              Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over
              fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is
              associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced investment and
              employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, health care, finance, and
              infrastructure construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy
              uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the
              United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major
              economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the
              1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.}},

RA project
1. Download the data (Only the press Briefing?)
2. Organize the data in the database (Which kind of information I should extract?)
(How to tackle the joint press conference?) (Should I devide Q&A from principal corpus)
3. Processing the data (Sentiment analysis? pre-trained model such as BERT?)

RA project
--- Week 1 ---
Download the data
1. Download the data (Only the press Briefing?)
2. Organize the data in the database (Which kind of information I should extract?)
(How to tackle the joint press conference?) (Should I devide Q&A from principal corpus)
3. Processing the data (Sentiment analysis? pre-trained model such as BERT?)
--- Week 2 ---
Exploring the data
1. Find pre-trained model
2. Extrapolate sentiment analysis
3. Extrapolation of Uncertainty policy index
--- Week 3 ---
Fixing the dataset
1. Organize the directory 
2. Download a Bert model trained on finance 
3. Fix the Missing Data
--- Week 4 ---
1. Find a better model for sentiment analysis
2. Tunning the model
3. Adding the output to the Data
--- Week 5 & 6---
1. Generate a python code to extrapolate the index from cohmetrix
   1. Using AI model to avoid captcha
   2. Try to build a cycle to upload and download the data
   3. Cleaning the input text
--- Week 7 ---
1. Contact memphis university to tackle the issue of the stability of their server
2. Coding an r code to build a SVAR model to check the impulse response on sentiment and Uncertainty policy index
--- Week 8 ---
1. Looking for others AI model to evaluate the syntax of Cohmetrix
2. Rebuild the SVAR since The Cheolesky decomposition was in the opposite order
--- Week 9 ---
1. Generate a python code to merge the output of Cohmetrix in the dataset 
2. Implementing the new software from Memphis university 
--- Week 10 ---
1. Contact the university of memphis to signal the bugs in the software
2. Try other way to compute the grammar indexes 
--- Week 11 ---
1. Writing the code in matlab for Trump database 
2. Build a VAR model in matlab
--- Week 12 ---
1. Try to tackle the issue with mixed frequency 
2. build a code in matlab that takes the weekly avarages 
3. write in python the same code in order to be consistent 

--Sept23--
1. adj the issue with the weekly avarages computation
2. try to use a syntetih control

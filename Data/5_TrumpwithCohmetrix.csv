456,Trump,2020-08-31 12:45:00+00:00,"Remarks by President Trump in Press Briefing | August 31, 2020",Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
5:45 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I’d like to begin by saying we’ve just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market — Dow — in 36 years. That’s very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401(k)s and with the stocks that they have. And that’s a tremendous achievement: best in 36 years.
Let me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38 percent. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid, point-of-care tests. These tests return results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We’re being focusing — we’re focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high-risk populations. So we’re going to have the 15-minute, and less, tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point-of-care tests. That’s something.
This evening, I am pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials. So that’s joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and, hopefully, approval. In the United States, we’re doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months.
Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time.
I also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we’re seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, federal law enforcement is working with state and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists, and bring them to justice. We’ve just come up with a report that we’ve arrested a large number of people. It’s over 200. And you’ll be hearing about that, but they’ve been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We’re doing it very low key, but we’re trying to help cities. They are, in all cases, Democrat-run, but we’re doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent.
We’d like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately one hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don’t know why it’s good for him to have a city that’s falling apart and that’s under siege now for 94 days. But, really, it’s been under siege for years, if you know Portland.
So, to the mayor, I say: Whenever you’re ready, let us know. We’ll solve your problem of violence. We’ll solve your problem of crime. We’ll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you’ll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland.
The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the federal government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters, just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we’ve seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Biden — Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats; it’s Democrat-run cities, and it’s a shame, and it can be solved so easy. It can be solved very easily.
The violence is fueled by dangerous rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they’re very good at doing. We’ve taken that power away. They’re afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They’re afraid to be destroyed.
You saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republic — the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife Kelly. What they went through, but other people went through it too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is the public is very wise to it. They see what’s happening, and they’re wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly.
Left-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about, the — really, you hear this from people — what they’re saying, how they’re saying it — the violence, it’s terrible. And again, it’s Democrat politicians. I don’t know that they’re spurring it on or they’re afraid to stop it. But in any event, we’re there to help. We’re there to get things under control.
What they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And, frankly, the mayor — Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser — should have done a better job. She did a very poor job. But at the same time, we had the police, who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess, it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down but got right up, and two others joined them, and they were able to get Rand and Kelly through.
But it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar — not to the extent, in terms of taping. We don’t have to the tapes as strong, but some people went through — from what I heard — as bad, or worse.
The violent rioters share Biden’s same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, he didn’t mention the fact, and he didn’t mention the far left. He didn’t mention the far left, or, from what I saw, I don’t believe he mentioned the word “Antifa.” Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn’t mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement.
He went on point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn’t talk about those on the left. And those on the left are the problem, and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side: They’re both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious.
And until that neutralizes, you’re never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas. For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals repeating the monstrous lie that these were peaceful protests. They’re not peaceful protests. That’s anarchy. That’s — you look at the agitators, you look at the looters, you look at the rioters — that’s not a peaceful protest.
They keep using the term — it’s so nice — “peaceful protest.” And behind the reporter, the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I’ll be going tomorrow. And at least the governor asked me if I could, we would — I said, “You got to get the National Guard.” And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things, and that was about five days ago, six days ago. And ever since, it’s been very good.
Thirteen members of Biden’s campaign staff donated to bail and — rioters — they’re getting them out of jail. Looters — they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It’s outrageous that they’re now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem.
And they really want to put it on the — on the backs of the police. I see it. The police are — there’s just a war on law enforcement in this country. And without law enforcement, we wouldn’t have a country. We have very talented people; they’re not allowed to do their job.
If you give the radical-left power, what you’re seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they’ve had such problems.
To defeat them, we must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting. And that’s what we want to do.
They want to destroy our country. They’re going to destroy our suburbs. But I think I’ve gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration; they were going to be made much worse.
What we’re witnessing today is a result of left-wing indoctrination in our nation’s schools and universities. Many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism.
Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn’t even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren’t mentioned.
Two words that were taken out were the words “under God” — “under God” — two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance. In their caucus, I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said “That’s strange. What’s — that’s a big…” I tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn’t make a mistake. Then they did it later on.
So they took the word — essentially, took the word “God” out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We’re not taking the word “God” out of anything. We’re not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we’re not taking the great word “God” out of anything.
At our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left’s war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it’s good, but it’s gotten out of control. They’re unable to control this radical-left, crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly — very, very, quickly indeed.
The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our nation’s schools, where they’re trying to change everything that we’ve learned. What we’ve learned — in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason — cancel culture — whatever you want to call it.
At the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance — zero — for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the U.S. population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated.
Biden won’t even say the name “Antifa.” I don’t believe he said it today. He made a speech, and he didn’t mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn’t mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement, he mentioned the police, and — but he didn’t mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there’s no way that he’ll solve the problem. You don’t name it, you don’t solve it.
In fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants: the far-left policy agenda it’s asking for. And if that happened, we don’t have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn’t go away; they gain new power to spread the terror nationwide.
Most of our nation is extremely safe, by the way. You know, you only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago, and you see what’s happened in New York just in a very short period of time. It’s horrible what’s happened in New York. I love New York; I come from New York. And when I see — four years ago, I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He’s terrible mayor; one of the worst. I can’t say “the worst.” I mean, I — I’ve witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he’s certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what’s happening in New York, and I look at what’s happening in the city, and — so quickly. It happened so quickly. It’s a shame.
Biden’s strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he’s doing — I don’t think he even knows what he’s doing — and give them control over every lever of power in the United States government. But when you surrender to the mob, you don’t get freedom; you get fascism. That’s what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what — look what’s going on there and other places.
Biden is using — Biden is using mafia talking points: “The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want.” That’s what it is. “The mob will leave you alone. Give them what you want.” But it doesn’t work that way, because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking.
What happens is you give and give and give, and you take, and they no longer respect you. And that’s what’s happened with the Democrats, because I actually think they’ve lost control of these radical-left maniacs. I think they’ve lost control, because I don’t think they feel that’s helping them — when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland, and you look at Baltimore, and you look at so many different places and what’s going on there. The top 10 are all run by Democrats, and you can go a lot further down the list than 10.
In America, we will never surrender to mob rule because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we’re continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don’t even think about it. They wake up the next morning; they don’t even think about it.
This is the extreme left’s agenda for America: They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers.
No one will be safe. And, in fact, they want very much to let people in prison — like, as an example, the Boston bomber — they want to let everybody vote. If you’re in prison, if you’re the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don’t know, I don’t think that sells too well.
My administration is a very different approach. We want states to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard. We’re prepared. We’re ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country — East Coast, West Coast, doesn’t matter — we’re ready to move immediately, as we did in Minneapolis, as we did — we are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine.
Tomorrow, I’m going to a place where we moved very quickly — you know that — in Wisconsin. And we moved very, very quickly. And as soon as we moved, that was the end of that. It was very well behaved.
I’ll appoint more tough-on-crime prosecutors, support stiffer penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows. And we need order. We need — we need order. You can’t have cities run like these cities are run.
They gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more. And all of a sudden, they’ve lost these cities, but I’ll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, “Please come in.” As you know, they have to ask — unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don’t like to do that — they have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we’ll be there within a matter of minutes.
When I signed the executive order outlining 10-year prison sentences, as an example, for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was three months ago or so. I signed an order, and it said, “Ten years in prison.” Ten years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge, I haven’t seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They cancelled that march. They said 10 years is too long.
Before the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime. In the last two years of the Obama administration, murder increased 30 percent in major American cities, and we witnessed the largest two-year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century.
In the first two years of my presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation LeGend, surging federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. And we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot.
Since the beginning of Operation LeGend, we have conducted more than 1,000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third; got it down 33 percent. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don’t know that, but we sent them into Chicago without fanfare at all. But we cut it down in half; it’s still far too high. And if they’d ask for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we’d be able to cut it down to a very low number.
While I am President, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe. And we do — we honor our police; we honor our law enforcement.
I have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most — most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of — the sheriffs in Florida — all of them; law enforcement in Ohio; in Texas; North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I’ve gotten all of it. We’ll have to do a little study so I’m totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn’t, I think we have to look at them — where do they come from.
So we — we’ve done a real job. We’re ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don’t even have to put it in writing. We’ll put it in writing later. We’ll get them in there, and we’ll straighten out the city very quickly — whichever city we may be talking about.
So those governors that are responsible for a state that has a city that’s got a lot of problems: Call me or the mayor can call me, and we’ll be there very quickly.
Tomorrow, we’re making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we’re proud of it because, in six days, it’s been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately.
Okay, please. Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-8-31-2020/

1:03 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: Good afternoon, everyone. The President shows up. When the Trump administration arrives in a Democrat-run city engulfed in chaos, peace is restored, law and order is upheld.
Washington D.C., New York, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Kenosha: all of these cities are Democrat-run; all of these cities have experienced anarchy, violence, and destruction in recent days — the opposite of a peaceful protest.
This is the reality facing American cities and towns across the country. This is not hypothetical. These are real people and real lives that have been impacted.
Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, rejected federal law enforcement in an irrational and tone-deaf letter. Mayor Wheeler might have thought he put political points on the board, but the very next day, a protester was shot and killed on the streets of his city.
Before the Trump administration took action in Kenosha, businesses were burned, property damaged, and chaos was rampant. Then, nearly 1,000 National Guard troops and 200 DOJ personnel were deployed at the request of local officials. President Trump showed up, and law and order arrived.
Nationally, according to the DOJ, 300 have been arrested and 302 charged amid riots and unrest. Democrats are late to the game. I’ve stood behind this podium and highlighted this issue for months. While this President is always willing to show up, it is incumbent on Democrats to step up: Invite federal law enforcement in; we stand ready. Do not tolerate anarchy, violence, and destruction. Rioting is not right. Secure your streets.
President Trump will visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, tomorrow. This president will show up. He will go to cities where Americans are hurting.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

5:32 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And it’s good to see you all.  Hope you had a great weekend at your convention.  And we’re going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.
But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I’d like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Yesterday, I approved a major disaster declaration for California.  I spoke to Governor Newsom as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their state.  That continues.  The federal government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires.  We’re working very closely with the governor and very closely with a lot of great state representatives and local representatives, and we’ll take care of the situation.  But we have 26,000 first responders already.
Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes.  As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire — one of the biggest we’ve ever seen — my administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly.  Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana two days later.  This is somewhat unprecedented — the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another.
Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico.  We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous — tremendous people.
We have — FEMA is lined up.  We have the Coast Guard ready.  The Coast Guard has — has done a fantastic job.  They do so many — they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.
I’m asking all Americans in the storm’s path to follow the instructions of your state and local governments very closely.  And I’ve approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana.  FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help.  They will be in there very quickly — very, very quickly.
And I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I’ve informed him.  And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go.  We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California.  So we have a great team.  Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.
On the therapeutics front, this is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time.  This is a great thing.  Today, I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.  The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization — and that’s such a powerful term: emergency use authorization — for a treatment known as convalescent plasma.  This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection.  It’s had an incredible rate of success.
Today’s action will dramatically expand access to this treatment.  And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar.  I want to thank the FDA — all of the people that have been working very hard on this.  It showed tremendous potential.
This is the only possible — and it’s only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed that has everybody working together.  We’re years ahead of approvals.  We would be — if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we’d be two years, three years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you’ll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.
To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we’re removing unnecessary barriers and delays not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government.
We’ve provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus.  Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent.  It’s a tremendous number.
The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease.
Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.  Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.
In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have — who have recovered — and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they’ve donated — but these are people recovering from the virus — to donate plasma.  Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled.
And today, I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today please.  It’s been really an incredible — just incredible people.  The country has united so strongly behind this.
And I’ll go over the numbers, but if you look at what’s happened and the success that we’ve had that people don’t talk about — the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world.  You don’t hear that.
The European Union’s case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States.  Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.
And I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words.  And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up — and especially over the last few days — in getting this done.  The results have been incredible, and I think you’ll see the results even go up very substantially.  So we appreciate it.
And maybe I’ll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen.  Thank you very much, Alex.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today.
Thanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19.  And thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world.
In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment.
President Trump is the Right to Try President, and he’s fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments.  Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use, and this FDA authorization is one result of that effort.
The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course — within three days of being diagnosed — with plasma containing high levels of antibodies benefited the most from treatment.  We saw about a 35 percent better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment — which were patients under 80 who were not on artificial respiration.
I just want to emphasize this point because I don’t want you to gloss over this — this number.  We dream, in drug development, of something like a 35 percent mortality reduction.  This is a major advance in the treatment of patients.  This is a major advance.
Convalescent plasma is one new tool that we’ve added to our arsenal against COVID-19, alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied.  Because of the President’s Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall.
Operation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing so that if they meet FDA’s gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.
Americans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to Coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight.  Know: If you donate plasma, you could save a life.
We’ve also provided guidance so healthcare providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.
So, thank you again, Mr. President, for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19.  And I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they’ve approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA.
And I’ll turn it over to Dr. Hahn if that’s okay, Mr.  President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thank you very much.
Please, Doctor.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  It’s good to be here today to announce FDA’s recent decision.  From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers.  And I just want to echo the President’s thanks to the more than 17,000 men and women who work at FDA.  They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.
So, plasma is the liquid portion of the blood.  That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection — in this case, COVID-19 — and that liquid portion can be extracted.  And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, it’s been given to patients with infectious diseases — for more than 100 years.  So there was a really good rationale for why this might work.
And, in fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded-access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the federal government, under President Trump’s leadership, and that has gone on for the last four months.  More than 90,000, close to 100,000 Americans have enrolled in this program and over 70,000 have received treatment.  This is one of the largest expanded-access programs in the history of FDA.  So, a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.
So, in the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data — not just the data from this expanded-access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this.  Those — those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization.
In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients, as described by Secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35 percent improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.
Now, we’re waiting for more data.  We’re going to continue to gather data.  But this clearly meets the criteria that we’ve established for emergency use authorization, and we’re very pleased with these results.
So, let me just put this in perspective.  Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35 percent improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit.  What that means is — and if the data continue to pan out — 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.
We’ve seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country.  And what this EUA does — EUA — emergency use authorization today does: It allows us to continue that and meet the demand.
And again, I want to echo the President’s and the Secretary’s ask of the American people: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, please donate.  It could save a life.
And, Mr. President, thank you again.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Stephen.  I appreciate it.
Okay, any questions, please?  Please, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-23-2020/

5:54 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I’d like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.
Today, I’m directing the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to notify the U.N. Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran.  It’s a snapback; it’s not uncommon.
Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which was a product of the Obama-Biden foreign policy failure — a failure like few people have seen, in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short-term deal.  This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to Iran — $150 billion, to be exact — plus $1.8 billion in cash, which I don’t know that the President have the authority to give.  He gave $1.8 billion in cash.  Just another great deal.  That turned out to be a total disaster.  It would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.
And I won’t say anything, because I don’t like saying it, but Iran doesn’t have so much money to give to the world anymore — to the terrorists, to give to al Qaeda and various other groups of people that they were funding.  They have to keep their own regime together, and it’s not easy for them.
And if and when I win the election, within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly.
But that deal was a disaster: 150 billion dollars; 1.8 billion dollars in cash.  And we got nothing, except a short-term, little deal.  A short-term, expiring.  It’s starting to expire already.  It’s terminated, but it would have, if we didn’t terminate it, start to expire very shortly.
A good deal was the deal we made with UAE and Israel.  And, by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal.  Countries that you wouldn’t even believe want to come into that deal.  And, all of a sudden, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East, and you couldn’t have done it with this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with Sleepy Joe Biden.
I imposed the toughest-ever sanctions on Iran, and this has caused great difficulty for them giving money to terrorist organizations.  And if they do, they’ll have hell to pay.
Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, in addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the two leading terrorists by far in the world.  The founder of ISIS.  Nobody even talks about that.  And we also defeated — we now have 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria.  When I took over, it was a mess.  It was a total mess.  It was — they were all over the place.
My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on.  They will never have a nuclear weapon.  Iran will never have — mark it down.  Mark it down: Iran will never have a nuclear weapon.  When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the U.N. sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy — a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.
Here at home, through Operation LeGend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat-run American cities.  It’s absolutely shocking.  When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles — Democrat-run cities — they’re a mess because they don’t get it.  Either they don’t get it or there’s something that nobody else understands.
We’ve deployed more than 1,000 additional federal agents to help these Democrat-run disasters.  We just have done this.  We have to give them a hand.  And we can stop it immediately, like a Portland would be so easy to stop.  We’d stop it immediately.
We only sent in some Homeland people — who are great, by the way — to save the courthouse, because it would have been blown up or burned down, and they did that very easily.  But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it’s Homeland, whether it’s FBI, whether it’s just law enforcement — and we’d send them in quickly.  We would eradicate it, just like happened in Minneapolis.  As soon as they were called in — they should have been called in a lot sooner; you would’ve had far less damage.
Today, we announced that Operation LeGend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already.  Bad ones.  Bad ones.  Really bad people.  Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow.  And they’ll be a very long time in prison for what they’ve done to these cities.  Most cities are well run; most of the nation is well run.  And the areas that we’re talking about are all — in all cases, run by Democrats, usually radi- — radical-left-leaning Democrats, like in New York or in Portland.
We’ve made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Memphis, and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson, and 91 murders.
We’re also using the full power of the federal government to defeat, as you know, the China virus.  New cases have declined in 80 percent of the jurisdictions in the past week.  Eighty percent.  New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak.  And other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look — because we’ve done an incredible job — but they’re having a lot of outbreaks, but they’ll be able to put them out and we put them out.
The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country 54 percent since its peak in April.  Fifty-four percent.  Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus: 92 percent of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older.  Only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred among those 44 years — think of that — 44 years and younger.  So 44 years old and younger: only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred.  And many of those people had preexisting conditions, they had problems — heart, diabetes, and other problems, but — many of those.  So, think of that: only 2.7 percent under 44 years of age.
Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33 percent higher than the United States — evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations.  South Korea — you’ve been reading about South Korea doing well.  Well, they just had a very big breakout, but they’ll be able to solve the problem.
We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk, as we know.  Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching.  We have learned one thing: There’s nothing like campus, there’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board.  It’s been proven a lot better.  It’s a lot better.  The iPads are wonderful, but you’re not going to learn the same way you do by being there.  So, nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching.
For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal few [sic] — a seasonal flu.  And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don’t talk about it in the same way, and they shouldn’t.  But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to.
Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives.  It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans.  Makes sense.
And the shutdown thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down.  You look at certain areas that — in all cases, Democrat-run — still shut down, and the numbers there aren’t even good.  But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse.  A lot of problems are being caused — probably far more, I would say, Scott, than is caused by the virus itself, now that we understand the virus.
Colleges should take reasonable precautions.  Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness.  And universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors and teachers.
The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high-risk settings — and to prevent transmission, period — but especially in nursing homes; and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.
We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country.  We have a tremendous unused testing capacity.  It’s something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us.
In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science-based approach to protecting the high risk while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work and school.  Our country will be open.  Our country is getting open quickly.  Our stock markets are almost back to where they were, prior to the China virus disaster coming in.
And I want to thank you all for being here, and we’ll take some questions.
Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-19-2020/

     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Where is Nancy Pelosi?  The House is in recess.  House and Senate Democrats left town after failing to compromise and make a deal to provide relief to the American people.  While Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues went home, this President remained hard at work.  President Trump took executive action, including stopping evictions; providing unemployment insurance; pausing student loan payments; cutting the payroll tax, which put money in the pockets of all Americans. 
     Democrats apparently were unable to stick around to make a deal.  Now, suddenly, Democrats will be rushing back to Washington.  But why?  The answer: the United States Postal Service.  It’s a stunning turn of events.  Democrats went home after accomplishing nothing: no deal on stimulus checks, no deal on small-business relief, no deal on eviction protections.  The concerns of everyday Americans were not the concerns of Democrats on Capitol Hill. 
     So where is Nancy Pelosi?  She and her Democrat colleagues will be back in Washington soon to pursue their latest manufactured crisis: the Postal Service.  Democrats denied a $10 billion offer for the U.S. Postal Service by this President before they went on recess.  But now they’re back to pursue the latest Democrat-manufactured crisis.  It’s sad, but it’s clear where Democrats’ priorities stand. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.

5:26 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  And thank you for being here.  Let me provide a brief update on the China virus, as well as our economic recovery, which is going really very well, as you probably have been hearing.
     Nearly 85 percent of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases, and that’s despite the fact that we have the number one testing program anywhere in the world.  We’re up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country.  This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6 percent; the test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5 percent, a 71 percent reduction from April and a 15 percent reduction from mid-July.  That’s a big reduction.  The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April.
     And I urge everyone to apply commonsense mitigation.  We know that.  And we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for really doing such a great job. 
     The United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined.  If you combine all of Europe, it’s less than what we do.  Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes.  Nearly 80 percent of all commercial lab test results are now returned within three days.  So we’ve gotten that number down from about eight days to three days, and that’s only in the longer-term lab cases.  But we have many 15- minute tests; we have some 5-minute tests.  The turnaround time for federal surge testing sites is just two days.  So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can’t do anything about, it’s all the way down to two days.  That’s a very substantial reduction.  Great job by the people that do it.
     We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals.  Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for nearly half of all fatalities.  That’s an incredible thing.  So it’s 1 percent of the U.S. population but they account for nearly half of the fatalities from the China virus.  That’s why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment.  And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.
     In the coming days, we’ve worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the governors — 50 governors all around the United States — and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the governors.  And I think, for the most part, they’re doing a really good job.  They’re focused very heavily on nursing homes.  And when they need equipment that they can’t get — remember, they’re supposed to get it, but when they can’t get, we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock.
     Thanks to my administration’s decisive action to save American jobs, we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history.  And that’s because the foundation that we set previously, before the virus came and hit our shore — the foundation was so strong; we had such a strong foundation that we’re recovering much faster than anybody anticipated.  It turns out that it will be a very, very strong “V,” and you’ll see that in just a second.
     So retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all-time high.  That’s not all time for this month or last month; that’s at an all-time high, and you see that with the chart.  This was previous to the — the plague, I call it — the plague coming into our land, and really affected 188 — dealing with 188 countries. 
     And if you see, we’ve not only recovered but we’re at a much higher level than we were even then.  That’s an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible.  So we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history.  That’s an amazing statement. 
     So retail spending is great, and now, if they would put up, auto production has surged 28 percent, and that’s your auto production, which is right there.  (A chart is displayed.)  So you’ll see that that’s now about even to where it was, and that was at an all-time record high, and we’re already even. 
     And if you had a chart for used cars, you’d see that used car sales are setting a record, and that’s great for production because when the used cars are practically not available — they’re very, very tight — that means you’re going to make a lot of new cars.  So that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now, but that’s a fantastic number.  That’s a number that’s the equivalent of where it was, and that was a record.
     So you see what’s happening with respect to the economy and the recovery.  And the stock market is almost at an all-time high.  In fact, NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-15-2020/

1:34 P.M. EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much, everybody.  So we have some very interesting news.  Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey’s very corrupt FBI, is expected to plead guilty.  You probably heard that.  It just came out.  So that’s just the beginning, I would imagine, because what happened should never happen again.  So, he is pleading guilty.  Terrible thing.  Terrible thing.  The fact is they spied on my campaign and they got caught.  And you’ll be hearing more. 
    Today, the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a new report on how my administration has harnessed the full power of the Defense Production Act to achieve the greatest industrial mobilization since World War Two, in our fight against the China virus. 
    New factories, businesses, and laboratories are being built all over America to match our nation’s demand for personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, drugs, testing supplies, therapeutics, and vaccines.  It’s been incredible what we’ve been able to do in a very short period of time.  We’re helping other countries also because we’ve been really — we’ve been doing it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. 
    It was just announced, a little while ago, industrial production rose for the third straight month.  It’s a big thing.  Factory output was up 3.4 percent this month after a 5.7 increase last month.  Those are getting to be record numbers.  And manufacturing capacity utilization is now up to almost 70 percent.  So we’re coming back very strong.  We should have a very good third quarter.  We should have an unbelievably good next year.  Next year, if we don’t mess it up with somebody that has no idea what they’re doing, could be a fantastic year.
    My administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act to a number — and related authorities — at a — 78 times, dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials.  So, put it a little bit differently: The administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act and related authorities 78 times.  That’s a lot, Peter, right?  It’s a big number: 78 times.  It came in very handy.  A lot of times we just mentioned it and they did what we asked them to do.  Dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials. 
    I’ve used the DPA more comprehensively than any President in history.  There was a time when the media would say, “Why aren’t you using it?  Why aren’t you using it?”  Well, we have used it a lot, where necessary.  Only where necessary.  For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation. 
    By invoking the DPA, we mobilized the extraordinary productive might of General Motors to manufacture ventilators.  GM repurposed the Kokomo, Indiana, plant in just 17 days — an all-time record — and has now produced over 21,000 ventilators. 
    We’re also working with Ford Motor Company and General Electric to produce over 30,000 ventilators a month in Michigan.  They’ve done a great job.  Our nation is now the king of ventilators.  I say that: the king of ventilators.  We’re sending them all over the world and helping a lot of countries that could never have ventilators.  And it’s — really, I guess we’re looking to produce over 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year.  Those are some numbers.  So we’re helping a lot of countries. 
    In April, I directed 3M to increase its manufacturing of N95 masks.  By May, they had increased production by over a million masks a day.  Think of that: They increased production of masks by over one million a day.  3M is now manufacturing an additional 39 million masks a month.  We also worked with Honeywell to open factories in Arizona and Rhode Island.  They’re now producing over 20 million masks a month. 
    By the end of the year, domestic U.S. manufacturing will have produced over 1 billion N95 respirators, and all of them are made right here in the USA.  That’s a big difference from the past.
    Overall, we’ve increased N95 mask production by 400 million masks a year.  Now, the media might say, “Why not 500?  Why not 600?”  Nobody has seen numbers like this ever.
    We delivered more than $75 million in support to Puritan Medical in Maine.  I was up there.  I was — as you remember, we had a tremendous visit and tremendous throngs of people along the roads on the way to Puritan Medical.  Puritan has a doubled their production of testing swabs from 20 million to 40 million per month.  They’re doing a fantastic job, and so is Maine.
    I’ve also used the DPA to fight price gouging and hoarding.  My administration located and seized over half a million pieces of hoarded personal protective equipment, including 299,000 pairs of medical-grade gloves, 192,000 N95 respirators, and 130,000 surgical masks.  That’s hoarding.
    My administration’s decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results.  People have done an incredible job.  We’ve replenished the Strategic National Stockpile that was very badly depleted when we took office and totally neglected in the last administration.
    Since the start of the pandemic, we have tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to over 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to over 15 million, and quadrupled the number of ventilators to 69,000.
    By September, the Strategic National Stockpile inventory is on track to contain over 300,000 — excuse me, 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks, over 4.5 billion gloves, and over 190,000 ventilators.  That’s far more than we’ve done before.  It’s not even close. 
    As we talk about the economy, we continue to restore America’s industrial might.  We’re bringing jobs to the USA.  We understand that the economic health is critical — very critical to public health.  We’ll be discussing next week some of the outstanding numbers we have, compared to any other country.  There is no country even close when you look at what we’ve done compared to them on the stand- — from the standpoint of the economy and also during — even during the period of the China virus.
    In the last three months, we’ve added an average of 100,000 jobs every single day.  We’ve also added over 620,000 manufacturing jobs in the past three months.  That’s despite people saying, “You can’t do manufacturing jobs anymore.”  You’d “need a magic wand,” they said, but they were wrong.  Weekly jobless claims just fell below 1 million for the first time in a long time. 
    I’m pleased to announce that as part of Operation Warp Speed, the federal government will be partnering with McKesson Corporation — great company, which is a major medical supplier — to rapidly distribute a China-virus vaccine as soon as one is approved — fully approved.  They’re in stage three trials.  We have many of them going along different passes.  Also many different companies doing them — very, very incredible companies.
    We currently have three candidates in phase three clinical trials and are on pace to have more than 100 million doses of a vaccine ready before the end of the year and 500 million doses very shortly thereafter.  And we’re ready, logistically, to distribute them.  Our military is ready.  We have a great general who’s in charge.  That’s what he does, is he distributes things — usually it’s people and weapons, tanks — but in this case, it’s a vaccine or a therapeutic, as it may be.
    We continue to actively monitor the virus, executing our strategy to protect the vulnerable and prevent hospital overcrowding.  As of today, hospitalizations continue to be very stable, and we will be watching always very carefully.  Remain vigilant.
    We ask every citizen to practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask when distancing is not possible, and to protect the elderly.  Always protect the elderly.
    So now we’ll take a few questions if you’d like.
    John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-14-2020/

5:27 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everyone.  Thank you very much.  It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they’ve caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro — horribly shot — a young man, wonderful young man.  And we have just — this just came out two minutes ago.  So, Attorney General Barr just announced.
As you know, we named Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, where we’re going to be helping out, and are in the process of helping out, cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime — in particular, certain types of crime.  So that’s really good news.  They caught the killer of LeGend.
Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people.  That’s what it is.  At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.
Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans.  You know that.  He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early.
If he had followed — if we went after — I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died.  This is according to many people.  I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that.  He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.
Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every U.S. community based on his policies.  He wants to have ridiculous open borders.  I’ve been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that if you have open borders, you don’t have a country.  You don’t have a country, with open borders.  So he wants open borders.  The Democrats want open borders.
And if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through.  The wall is getting close to 290 miles long, and it’s having a huge impact.  So we disagree with him on that.  That’s one of the many different — many things that we disagree with.
But while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens.
He wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months — I guess this just happened; he thinks it’s good politics, I guess — no matter where they live and no matter their surroundings.  Because different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem.
He does not identify what authority the President has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed.
Also, many of our 50 states are doing the job at a level that frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice.  So I want to just say our governors have worked very hard.  They’ve worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that’s been going.
We have Scott now involved.  And so, Scott, congratulations.  You’ll be working with a lot of governors; you’ve already started.  And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.
If the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have?  That’s why he refused — Biden — to take questions.  He couldn’t answer any of them.  Couldn’t answer the questions.  He refuses to take questions.  He never takes questions.  I take questions; he never takes questions.  And you sort of wonder what’s going on, because they’re not that difficult.  Some can be nasty, but they’re not that difficult.  But he never takes questions.  So he just, I guess, left.  I didn’t see it, but I guess he just left the podium.  Put it in your minds.
My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks.  And I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do.  Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good.  Maybe they’re not so good.  But frankly, what do you have to lose?  You have nothing to lose.  So we do, and we’ve been saying wear them when it’s appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing, if you can’t distance enough.  And what do you have to lose?
But again, it’s up to the governors.  And we want to have a certain freedom.  We want to have a certain freedom.  That’s what we’re about.
At the same time, we also understand that each state is different and is facing unique circumstances.  You have very, very different states facing very unique differences and circumstances.
We’ve entrusted the governors of each state, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies, following guidance from the federal government and CDC.  We’re working with each state to implement a plan based on the facts and science.  We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the federal government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal.
Americans must have their freedoms.  And I trust the American people and their governors very much.  I trust the American people.  And the governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions, and Joe doesn’t.  Joe doesn’t.  Joe doesn’t know too much.
Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science.  That’s why we’re focused on protecting the high-risk Americans.  That is why we’re delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate.  And that is why we’re developing a vaccine and therapeutics in record time.  You’ll see that, I think, very soon.
Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to.  I think I can speak for you.  We’ve been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks.  But he wants them in the basement for months on end.
And you have governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their — wherever they may be — apartments.  And frankly, I don’t think the results are necessarily better than other results.  But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools, and grind society to a halt.  And he wants it done by a federal decree.  This would lead to a crippling long — long-lasting depression.  This would be a crippling long-lasting depression.
And yesterday, I showed you the numbers about how well we’re doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed.  And we’re back and very strong.  It’s a very strong “V.”  It’s almost a straight-up “V.”  We’ll be discussing that over the next couple of days.
But the economy is coming back, and the employment numbers over the last three months are a record in history of our country.  And we’ll be back next year.  I think we’ll be maybe even stronger than the previous years, where we set every record in the book: unemployment and stock market.
By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record.  And NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-13-2020/

1:30 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This is a historic day, and I have here with me Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, Ambassador Robert O’Brien.  They’re going to summarize the history that was made today and take a few of your questions.  We also have Special Representative Avi Berkowitz here; and Special Envoy to Iran, Brian Hook, who will be in attendance. 
     MR. KUSHNER:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  And thank you all for being here. 
     I want to start today by congratulating the people of Israel and the people of the United Arab Emirates.  Today is a historic breakthrough and a great day for peace. 
     I also want to congratulate President Trump on this milestone.  He worked very hard on this with his team.  We worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, who really are two visionary leaders who made a big step forward today to really change the region. 
     The last time we had an agreement like this in the region was 1994, when Israel made an agreement with the Kingdom of Jordan, which stopped aggression and helped bring forward peace. 
     Over the last 26 years, there’s been a lot of developments in the region — some positive, but many that have set the region back, and it has led to lots of lives being lost, lots of opportunity and hope being destroyed, and — and a region that really has had a lot of problems.
     When President Trump came into office, we had a caliphate for ISIS in the Middle East, which was the size of Ohio.  We had a lot of instability.  Iran’s aggression was being felt all throughout the region.  A lot of their proxies were very well funded and causing instability in Yemen and in Syria and in other places. 
     And now we’re in a position where we’ve been able to work with our allies.  A lot of our allies felt abandoned.  President Trump has been able to rebuild those relationships.  His first trip as President was to Saudi Arabia in May of 2017, where he laid out the problems that were facing the region and very clearly articulated that, in order to make progress, we’d all have to work together around common goals and we’d have to acknowledge historic differences and historic conflicts.  But we can’t let those conflicts hold us back. 
     President Trump’s leadership, the ability to build the relationships with the leaders in the region — people were modernizing their society and realizing that we needed a new paradigm.
     On President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, we made an agreement with a lot of these countries that we’re going to start a counterterror finance center.  And since then, we’ve worked to limit the amount of funding that’s gone to extremist groups. 
     We worked with Saudi Arabia, which is the custodian of the two holy sites, and we worked with them to do a counter center, a counter-extremism center to combat online extremism, and that’s made a big difference because you can’t solve the short-term problem without taking on the long-term fight.  We’ve seen Saudi Arabia make a lot of modernizations over the last years, giving more rights to women and taking steps in the right direction, which have been very positive.  And now today’s breakthrough really allows us to go forward. 
     To give you a little bit of background on this deal, this is something that’s been in discussions now for over a year and a half.  We were talking with Israel; we were talking with United Arab Emirates about moving forward.  Obviously, because of the Israeli elections and because of some other things that were happening in the region, this is something that was talked about but never really got to the right place for it to happen.
     As you know, with deals, deals happen when deals are ready.  And peace deals are very rare and very historic, and there’s a lot of reasons why people would be held back from moving forward. 
     What we saw was when the President rolled out his vision for peace, which we worked very hard on for a couple of years to really try to understand the issues in the region between the Israelis and Palestinians, he put forward 180 pages of detail on how we can address the issues of the past but also figure out how to move forward. 
     During that acknowledgement, President Trump was able to get Israel to agree to have a two-state solution with the Palestinians and, for the first time in history, to agree to a map that outlined the territory that they would be willing to work with in order to see that happen.  That showed a lot of people in the region that Israel was serious about really moving forward and making peace and also showed them that President Trump’s leadership and diplomacy could make things happen that hadn’t happened previously. 
     What happened is, as Israel was discussing with us providing — taking Israeli law and sovereignty to areas of the West Bank and applying it, we were having these discussions.  And over the last six weeks, the discussions between UAE and Israel started accelerating around this being a potential different path. 
     We all saw Ambassador Otaiba’s op-ed that came out that said that he thought applying Israeli sovereignty to this — to these areas would be detrimental to the region.  And a new course, a new option was created that was discussed that ultimately both countries thought was a much more viable option to go forward. 
     Israel has agreed to suspend those efforts at this time.  And as a result, we’re going to focus on bringing these two countries together.  This is really a historic breakthrough, and it shows that President Trump’s leadership, from the Riyadh speech until today — you see a much different Middle East than what he inherited.  And hopefully, there’s a lot more good things to come. 
     This is an icebreaker between these two countries.  This is the first Arab country to normalize relations with Israel in a long time — 26 years since Jordan.  And what we’re going to hopefully see from there is more countries start to do the same. 
     The final thing I’ll just say is that, here in America, the biggest threat that we saw in the last campaign was really two things.  One was ISIS.  The caliphate was growing, we were seeing journalists being beheaded, we were seeing people burnt in cages, and the threat of ISIS was something that was very scary to a lot of Americans and needed to be stopped.  The instability was providing a place for extremists to plan attacks, to plan all kinds of terrible things, and the extremists were trying to radicalize the next generation. 
     One of the biggest excuses that extremists use to radicalize the next generation is the mosque and — the Al-Aqsa Mosque — and saying that it’s being threatened and the fact that Muslims aren’t able to pray there.  This deal will allow for flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv, which will allow Muslims a real entrée to come and visit Israel peacefully and to come and pray at the mosque with whatever frequency they deem appropriate. 
     This is a big breakthrough.  As people go there and pray and see that this is available, they’ll share it with their friends and they’ll share the experiences, they’ll share pictures of it on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter, and people throughout the world will see that the mosque is safe and that — that all people are welcome there. 
     So this is a really great step forward for the region, a great step forward for the country, and a great step forward for the world.  And again, I just want to really compliment the three leaders who worked very hard to make this possible: Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, and President Trump here in America. 
     Thank you.
     MR. O’BRIEN:  So, thank you to Jared for that summary.  And it’s — it’s been extraordinary work by a number of fine diplomats, working under President Trump’s leadership, to arrive at today’s outcome.  Jared Kushner has been at the forefront of those efforts.   Avi, Brian Hook, and others have — have put in just — just tremendous work, under the President’s direction, to get where we are here today.
     And I know, Jared, you’re not a — you don’t have a diplomat-title or ambassador title, but we don’t have the finer ambassador, especially in the region, than Advisor Kushner.  So thank you for those — those remarks and for the really incredible effort. 
     I want to start by congratulating, today, the President of the United States; the Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu; and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  This is a remarkable achievement, and they’ve been — the achievement is now — will now be known in history as the “Abraham Accords,” or the “Ibrahim Accords” in the Muslim countries, or the “Avraham Accords” in Israel. 
     It’s something very special.  It’s something that doesn’t happen very often.  Very few of my predecessors, as National Security Advisor, have been able to come to this podium to announce a peace deal in the Middle East.  It’s a — it’s a very rare thing.
     As I said earlier in the Oval Office today, the President is going to be known in history as one of the change makers and one of the remarkable leaders in the Middle East.  And that’s not something that you may have thought of when he came into office.  But one of his very first steps was repairing our relationship with Israel, which had been badly damaged, especially in the last month of the prior administration. 
     The President did something that was unheard of.  Many presidential candidates, going back two decades, had promised that if they were elected, they would move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  President Trump had the courage to do it, and he developed wonderful credibility and a reservoir of goodwill in Israel. 
     He recognized the Golan Heights as being Israeli territory, and — and took those away from a very — what could have been a very destabilized situation that we’ve seen develop in Syria. 
     He destroyed the physical caliphate of ISIS, which, Jared had said, was the size of Ohio.  It was — it stretched across the Middle East, and terror reigned because of the caliphate.
     He brought justice to al-Baghdadi, who had killed so many Americans: Sotloff and Mueller and Kassig and Foley. 
     He put maximum pressure on Iran and — and cut off much of the terrorist funding that was going to the proxy wars in Yemen, in Hezbollah, in Lebanon, in Syria, and throughout the region. 
     And today, we have the — the Abraham Accords.  He’s brought peace to the Middle East, at least peace between the UAE and Israel.  And what I have said is the President is often known as the greatest dealmaker, and he wrote the book “The Art of the Deal.”  And he’s considered a great, great dealmaker, which he is. 
     But I think history is going to remember the President for being a great peacemaker.  He brought peace to Israel and the UAE.  He has signed a — his diplomat signed a historic accord in Afghanistan.  I want to remind people that we haven’t had an American casualty in combat in Afghanistan since February 29th.
     He used his offices and his — his pressure to stop Idlib from being overrun in Syria, and brought a ceasefire agreement when — when Turkey had invaded Northern Syria. 
     A lot of people said that when he came into office that there would be war in North Korea.  But through personal diplomacy, he’s — has kept that situation from — from turning into a kinetic event.
     So, it’s really remarkable, I think, when you — when you step back and take a look at what this President has done on the peace front.  And it wouldn’t surprise me — it’ll take some time in this environment — but it wouldn’t surprise me if the President is eventually nominated for a Nobel Prize for the — this — today’s work is an example of why he would be rightly considered and should be a frontrunner for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
     So, I also want to compliment the courageousness of Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince.  You know, there have been two other great Arab leaders — King Hussein — in my lifetime, King Hussein and Anwar Sadat — who have made peace with Israel.  And now, Mohammed bin Zayed enters that pantheon of great, courageous Arab leaders. 
     And I want to compliment President — Prime Minister Netanyahu, in Israel, who was under tremendous pressure to extend Israeli law and sovereignty to portions of the country, but is — has stepped up against that political pressure to make peace.  Something that may have been politically popular, but he put the interest of his country and his people first.
     And so I think we’ve got some very courageous leaders that worked with the President to come to today’s tremendous historical accord. 
     Stepping back from — what does this mean beyond the historic idea of a major Arab country making peace with Israel all these years after 1948?  It makes sense on so many different levels.  The UAE and Israel are both capable security partners of the United States, and close — close partners of ours in the region, standing up to Iran, standing up to Islamic extremism.  They’ll — them — the peace agreement between these two countries will encourage and foster cooperation in those efforts. 
     These are very innovative countries.  Israel is called the “startup nation.”  And for those of you who have been there, it’s — you feel like you’re driving through Palo Alto through half the country.  The UAE is also a very innovative country.  Putting those two nations together is going to create a dynamic of innovation and creativity in the region.  And they — both countries are populated by incredibly dynamic people. 
     There are tremendous opportunities that are going to arise from this agreement.  Jared talked about the idea of Arab pilgrims and Muslim pilgrims going to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, going up to the Mount, and having the opportunity to pray in peace in Israel. 
     The — as you know, the President has made religious freedom, especially religious freedom in the Middle East, a center point — a centerpiece of his foreign policy.  And this is a great step towards fulfilling the idea that the three great faiths that came from the Holy City — Christianity, Judaism, and Islam — will be able to pray and interact peaceably together in that beautiful city of Jerusalem.
     Tourism, with — Abu Dhabi and Dubai and the other Emirates have become meccas for tourism, especially before the Chinese virus — the COVID virus.  Israel is a great land for tourism.  That’ll expand trade between the UAE and Israel, which both have incredible economies.  And again, as we — as we recover from COVID, this agreement will help the economies of those countries and the countries in the region expand.  And I think you’re going to see an increase in jobs in all three countries as a result of these accords.
     With respect to the peace process overall, we’ve got a great team.  That team is going to be fanning out.  We’re going to be on the — working the phones.  We’re going to be in the region.  And we believe that there are other countries waiting in the wings that are going to watch and see how the — the tremendous response to the courage of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Crown Prince have been received by their people and by the world.  And, I mean, I’ve — I’ve already been on the phone with a number of European counterparts who have called to congratulate us for our role in — in this accord but who are — some of whom were astounded that this took place.
     And we also think that this could lead to a great deal for the Palestinian people, that — it’s a people that the President of the United States, President Trump, has not forgotten.  And he’s — he’s endorsed the two-state solution.  He wants to see the Palestinian people in a prosperous country of their own.  And the groundwork has been laid for that, so I think we’ll be working very hard on those efforts in the — in the coming months and — and year.
     So, again, today is a great day.  It’s a great day for the people of the UAE, it’s a great day for the people of Israel, for their leaders.  And it’s also a great day for the United States of America as we played a role that we’ve traditionally played throughout the world, in coming in to mediate in difficult situations and — and achieve peace and achieve prosperity for our friends and neighbors.
     And again, I’m honored to be a part of the President’s team on this.  And again, I’ll end with congratulations to the President for his leadership, and again, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  Thank you very much.
     MR. KUSHNER:  We’ll start with Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-13-2020/

5:56 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate you being here, and good evening.  As we continue to confront the China virus, we’re rebuilding America’s economy like nobody thought possible, actually.  We’re doing incredibly well.
The stock market is up almost 300 points again today.  While our economy is performing significantly better than Europe — which people have to understand very strongly; it’s performing better than any market anywhere in the world actually.  At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40 percent higher excess mortality than the United States.  And I will say that that’s a significant number.  We’re working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way.
We’re doing very well, as you know, on the vaccines and the therapeutics.  But think of that: We have the strongest economy — performing economy in the world.  We’re up — I think it’s $9 trillion since March — $9 trillion in value.  That’s a — that’s a number that nobody has ever heard of before.  We’re also getting close to about a 50 percent number since March, which is incredible.  So, it’s $9 trillion.  It’s almost 50 percent.  In fact, I think it went above 50 percent today with the 300 point increase.  And it’s — so we’re doing much better than Europe, significantly.  And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40 percent higher excess mortality than the United States.
I just want to mention because another number of judges were approved recently.  We’ll be, probably, over 300 judges –federal judges, including court of appeals judges — approved by the end of my first term.  And other than they — when they added new judges into somebody’s term, which happens seldom, but we have more than any — this is a record.  Nobody has ever seen anything like this in one term.  So we’re going to have over 300 federal judges, and that’s court of appeals judges, and that’s just in the first term.  It’s — probably we’ll finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing.
The stock market’s rebound signals a “V”-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world — stronger.  If you look, you’ll see exactly what we have.  We — we lead the world.  Japan is second.  But in terms of dollar value, it’s not even close.  So there it is.  A lot of great competitors: Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong.  The United States is leading the world, very substantially.
On the second slide, you’ll see the virus-induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations.  And you see that, right there; there’s the United States.  And that’s despite the fact that we’ve done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we’ve done more, by far, ventilators.  We’re building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we’re distributing them all over the world.  We’re helping other countries.
But despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal.  I’m sure you’d love to put them in your various media outlets.  I know you want to get that out.  If you want to leave the room early and do that, that would be fine.  The rapid recovery — but it would be nice to report it.
The rapid recovery of homebuilders’ sentiment points to massive new construction.  And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes, and that’s because people have tremendous confidence.  This is where we went, and the housing market has quickly rebounded.  We were at a record, and now we’re going to be at a record again very shortly.  Those numbers are incredible.  That’s where we are.  And we had to turn off the economy, and now we’re turning it back on, and that’s beyond a “V” shape.  This is going to be very strong; it’s called a “strong ‘V.’”
Automobile demand has increased 65 percent over the last three months.  Sixty-five percent automobile demand.  And we’re anticipating that that’s going to go up even further, but that’s more than any — anybody else.  The manufacturing sector — remember “manufacturing is dead,” according to the past administration of Obama and Biden?  “Manufacturing is dead. You’d need a magic wand.”  Well, you don’t need a magic wand.  You need competence and capability.  The manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at the highest reading since October of ’18, which is — was a — an extraordinary period of time.  And there we are.  That’s pretty good.
These are numbers that nobody has seen until just recently, and now they’re just coming out.  These are numbers that are leading — I guess, the stock market people, they’re very smart people.  I know many of them, and they’re seeing things that they don’t even believe.  So, the manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at its highest reading in a long, long time.
The economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last three years — a record, by far — and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted.  So, there you are.  You look at that, and that’s a record, and it’s a record for the quarter.  We had over 9 million — substantially more than 9 million jobs.
So those are incredible numbers about our economy and how it’s coming back.  It’s coming back very strongly, and it’s coming back at a level that’s far greater than anybody anticipated.  And we’re very proud of that.  And I give a lot of credit to all of our people — Steve and Larry.
And we’ll be talking about it.  If you have any questions on it — shouldn’t have any questions.  I didn’t — I didn’t print those charts.  Who did?  The economy (inaudible), let’s see.  I don’t know.  We’ll find that out for you, but it wasn’t us.  We took those — we took those numbers from somebody.  Where did you get those numbers, Larry?  They’re from where?
MR. KUDLOW: It’s from the BLS jobs report (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  BLS jobs report.
MR. KUDLOW:  The monthly jobs report, through July.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Everybody has that — everybody who needs?
The Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical leftwing agenda that the country doesn’t want and won’t accept.
For example, they’ve asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion — that’s billion — $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption.  You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race.  They should do that race over, by the way.  I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race.  When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner.  So, her opponent — I don’t know what’s happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy.
And then you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened.  And they admitted they made a mistake.  And many were sent to dead people and many were sent to — a number was sent — I guess, two — that at least two, three, four were sent to dogs.  One was sent to a cat.  They’re sent all over the place.  That was in Virginia.
In Paterson, New Jersey, they had a massive amount of voter fraud.  And it’s been a disaster.  Paterson, New Jersey has been total disaster — that’s universal mail-in voting.
So, they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country, where you have hundreds of millions of voters.  They can’t do a little race with 20,000 people; now they want to take it countrywide.  Mail-in voting — it’s going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections.  When you always talk about “Russia, Russia, Russia,” China, Iran on voting — your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran.  Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats.
But now the Democrats — they want $3.5 billion, think of it.  But now that they’re unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money — of course, we would never approve an amount like that.  And they also want $25 billion additional for the Post Office, Steve.  Twenty-five billion for the Post Office, so the Post Office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent, at random, all over the place.  They have no idea where they’re going.
So, they want $25 billion, and they want — think of this: They want $3.5 billion.  Would you say that’s enough to cover it?  I think we could do it for less, right?  I think we could do it for less.  But they want $25 billion for the Post Office because of this.
And remember, the new man — who is a great person, a great businessman — he just got there a little while ago.  The Post Office has been run poorly for many, many decades.  Great people in the Post Office, incredible people, but they’ve had very bad leadership for many years.  So, we’ll get it straightened out.
But they turned down this bill because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve.  So, they want $25 billion for the Post Office.  They want $2.5- or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in — $3.5 billion.  And the bill is not going to happen because they don’t even want to talk about it because we can’t give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus.  It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they’re asking for.  So, therefore, they don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting.  So, therefore, they can’t do it, I guess.  Right?
Are they going to do it even though they don’t have the money?  They’re asking for the $3.5 billion.  They’re asking for $25 billion for the Post Office so they can do this, I guess, and other things.  At $25 [billion], I would hope it would be a lot of other things, too.
But, therefore, they don’t have it.  They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in votes.  It’ll be the greatest rigged election in history.  It’ll be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated, other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign — President Obama, Biden, and everybody else.  And they got caught.  Let’s see what happens.  This will be one of the greatest frauds in history.
So they’re admitting that they want $3.5 billion, and they’re not going to do a deal that’s good for the American people.  Therefore, they’re not going to get the $3.5 billion.  Therefore, they can’t do the universal mail-in vote.  It’s very simple.  How are they going to do it if they don’t have the money to do it?
The Democrats are also holding up money for schools, and hospitals, and small businesses, and state and local governments.  They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action.  And I did executive orders, which are now in full force in effect, and they’re going forward.
I signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus.  That’s $400 more than the Democrats have provided.  Remember that: That’s $400 more than the Democrats have provided.
Nancy and Chuck haven’t provided anything.  And remember this: President Obama, when we had a problem — a pretty big problem; a very big problem — you know what he gave?  Twenty-five dollars.  He gave 25 bucks.  So now they say, “Well, we want to give $500 or we want to give $600.”  They don’t want to give.  They don’t even give anything.  They’re not doing anything.
But President Obama and Biden — Sleepy Joe — gave $25.  Twenty-five.  And they’ll complain, “Oh, we want to give more.”  Well, we’re giving $400, and that’s now in the works, and that’ll be getting out to the people soon, Steve.  Okay?  Remember that: $25 is what they gave the last time.  Twenty-five.
I want to make it unmistakably clear that I’m protecting people from evictions.  They didn’t want to do that.  The Democrats didn’t want to do a protection from evictions — people getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the “China virus,” whatever you want to call it.  We have 20 — now we’re up to 21 different names.  All we know is it came out of China, and it shouldn’t have.  They should have stopped it.
Under my executive order, HUD, HHS, and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes.  They’re not going to be evicted.  They are not going to be evicted.  And those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you’ll make sure of that.
I’m providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020.  That’s a tremendous amount of money that’s being supplied and given to families.  Tremendous.
The Democrats didn’t want to do a payroll tax.  They thought it was “too much money,” I guess, or it would make businesses too successful.  They don’t want to see success.  They certainly don’t want to see it before the election.  They certainly don’t want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there.  They don’t.  Because they say they can’t win with that kind of success.  They can’t win.  They have to get used to it.
Remember: We’ve already gotten $3 trillion in stimulus, so they should have probably negotiated a little bit differently.  Maybe they should have asked for all of this before they got most of the money and we gave it out — a lot of it to the people.
When we win the election — when I win the election, I’m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape, or form hurting Social Security.  That money is going to come from the General Fund.  We’re not going to touch Social Security.  I said from day one that we’re going to protect Social Security, and we’re going to protect our people.  And Social Security is one of the things that will be protected.  Pre-existing conditions will be protected.  Medicare will be protected.
But Social Security will be totally protected under me.  Under them, it will not be protected because we will have a stock market crash the likes of which you’ve never seen.  Your taxes will be doubled and tripled.  And your regulations will go through the roof, which is what was causing the problems with the country in the first place.
Student loans: I signed a directive providing relief to student borrowers.  Not their fault that they can’t go to college.  I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.  So we’re going to take care of our students.  We have a lot of great students out there, and they — they got hit like everybody else.  So I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.
And the payroll tax — we’ll be terminating the payroll tax after I, hopefully, get elected.  We’ll be terminating the payroll tax, so that will mean anywhere from $5,000 to even more per family, and also great for businesses and great for jobs.  A lot of people will be very happy to hear that.  A lot of the great — certainly, conservative economists will be great to have — they think that’s the greatest thing we can do.  That’s better than the payments; that’s better than anything else.
But it’s a lot of money, and it’s — it’s going right directly to the people, and it goes there very easily.  But it also creates stronger companies to employ the people.  So we will be — on the assumption I win, we are going to be terminating the payroll tax after the beginning of the new year.
Today, I met with parents, students, teachers, and health experts to discuss the vital importance of safety and safely reopening America’s schools.  This evening, I’ll outline the commonsense recommendations that should guide schools as they reopen with precautions.  We want to be very, very safe and very careful — so, precautions in place.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide as we race toward the competition — and the completion — we’re competing with us, but I’m not completing — competing with anyone.  We just want to have a vaccine.  We have — we’re dealing with other countries, and we want them to do well.  We’re giving them whatever information they need.  We’re all working towards something that will happen.  It will happen before the end of the year — maybe substantially before, but before the end of the year.  And therapeutics will happen, likewise, even sooner.
But we’re looking for that responsible path forward to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to resume work and school and play football.  Go play football.
I spoke to some of the great football players — college players — Trevor and a lot of great players.  Called Coach — a coach called “Coach O.”  A lot of fantastic people I got to speak to — athletes, leaders.  They want to play football.  Let them play.  Let them play.  And they’ll — they feel safer in the field than they do walking around and doing nothing.
So, hopefully, that will happen.  And hopefully, when they play football, they will proudly stand for the National Anthem and they will proudly stand and — and respect the American flag — or at least I’m not watching.  I can’t speak for others, but based on what I see now and based on what I’m looking at, with respect to the NBA at this point, a lot of people agree with me.  So we want people — we would like to request people — you stand proudly for the flag and for the National Anthem.
In the months since the virus arrived, we’ve learned a great deal.  While this is a dangerous and highly infectious disease, it primarily affects the oldest segment of our population or those with chronic health issues.
The United States has the largest nursing home and assisted-living home population in the Western world, by far.  Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The median age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old.  These findings underscore that all Americans must continue to apply extreme vigilance in protecting our elderly population and those with chronic conditions.  Outcomes are very different for younger Americans without serious health issues — tremendously different.  They can often expect mild or moderate symptoms or even no symptoms whatsoever.  They have very strong immune systems, we’ve learned — even more so than we ever thought.
In a typical year, approximately five times as many Americans under the age of 65 die from heart disease as have so far been lost to the coronavirus from the same age group.  That’s an interesting statistic.
Bless- — blessedly, children appear to face the lowest risk of all.  It’s 99.995 percent of all fatilities [fatalities] are adults.  Think of that: 99.95.  That is extremely close to 100 percent of all fatilities [fatalities] are adults.
Children often have only mild symptoms, and medical complications are incredibly rare — very, very, very rare.  Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions.  In each of the last five years, the flu resulted in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to coronavirus, by far.  The flu — the flu does kill young people.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and protect students.  All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstances.  This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at a high risk.
And one of the things we’d like to do is when we make payment to schools — because we spend a lot of money on schools — we’d like to make the payment directly to the student or to the child.  And that would be to the parents, essentially, but to the child.  We want to follow the child so that if a school is closed, the family can go to another school, maybe in another area, but they can do it.  And we’d like to make that payment — rather than paying a school that’s closed, we’d rather pay directly.  We’re following the child — where the child goes.  And we want to pay the family, pay the child, and then the family can take care of the cost.
And we’re trying to get that approved too, but the Democrats don’t like doing anything, unless it means doing for the union, which controls Nancy and controls Chuck 100 percent.  And I have nothing wrong with the union.  I have great respect, more than — very few people do I respect more than a great teacher.  That’s a tremendous talent.  They — they’re really underappreciated.  These are phenomenal people with tremendous talent — the great ones are among the most important people we have in this country.
But — and they’ll be great at other — they’ll be great at charter schools.  And they’ll be great at — well, we talk about school choice, which we’d like to see so that parents can take their children to the school of their choice.  That’s something we want.  We think it’s very important, especially in the minority communities.  They want it so badly.  African American, Hispanic American, Asian American — they want it so badly.
But the two people I mentioned, Nancy and Chuck, they’re totally controlled by the heads of the union.  I think the teachers like us a lot.  We’re taking care of our teachers.  We want to take care of our teachers.
But we cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional, and academic development, and inflicting long-term, lasting damage.
I heard a gentleman today, a great person — some of you were at that meeting — from Harvard, say that every year is $10,000.  It’s a — people — they lose a tremendous amount of money in the future.  He mentioned $10,000.  And I think he was talking about on a yearly basis.  They lose a lot by every year of education that they lost.  Every year they gain, they gain $10,000.  And when you have students sitting at home, playing with a computer, it’s not the same.  That’s one thing we’ve learned for sure: It’s not the same.  It can never be the same as being in a classroom.  So we want to get our students in the classroom.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommendation that schools reopen.  They said, “Reopen.”  It said, quote, “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits.”  The doctors, also warned about the risk of increased abuse, substance use, depression, and suicide.  Suicide.
The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.”  So when you sit at home in a basement, looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away.  We have a lot of good experience at that, just by taking a look at what’s happening in politics.
Studies estimate that school closures last spring caused the average student to fall 50 percent behind in math and roughly 35 percent in reading compared to a typical year.  Think of that: It caused the average student to fall 50 percent behind in math and 35 percent in reading, compared to being at the school, being with your teachers, being in a classroom.  We’ve learned that.  We’ve learned that learning from a laptop is not great.
And, frankly, we’ve also learned that telehealth — a little unrelated, but it’s up 35,000 percent, and it’s been incredible — 35,000 percent.  We’ll check that number later, but that’s an incredible — but it is, people staying home.  And the telehealth — that has been a tremendous success.
We’ve learned those two things during this period of time with the — with the plague — with the plague coming in.  And those are two things we know.
School closures harm low-income students the most because they have less access to high-quality remote learning — they don’t have computers — and less resources for academic support.
All schools should be making plans to resume in-person classes as soon as possible.  To support the reopening of America’s schools, we provided $13 billion in elementary and secondary schools toward the CARES Act and CARES Act funding — we’re giving CARES Act funding — the vast majority of which remain available for states to use.  So, a tremendous amount of money: $13 billion.  That’s the CARES Act funding and we’re giving a large portion of that for states to use.
Today, I’m pleased to announce that we will provide up to $125 million reusable masks to various school districts all around the country.
My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen.
Finally, today my administration is highlighting general recommendations for all schools and guidance to protect high-risk teachers and students.  We’re working very, very closely with many of the schools and school districts throughout the country.
They include the following:


To ensure all students, teachers, and staff understand the symptoms of the China virus.
Require all students, teachers, and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school.
Encourage frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing during the school day, beginning upon entrance to school, and ensuring that hand-washing facilities are widely available throughout the school.  And, for the most part, schools have been very good at that.
Minimize large indoor gatherings.  Hold large gatherings outdoors whenever possible.
Maintain high standards of hygiene and ventilation within the classrooms, including keeping windows and doors open whenever possible, and running fans and air conditioning units whenever possible.
Require students, teachers, and staff to socially distance around high-risk individuals and socially distance whenever possible in any event.
Encourage the use of masks when social distancing is not possible.
Post instructions regarding hygiene and social distancing all over the school and all around the school.


We encourage schools to adopt these measures.  We’ve been working with so many of them.  And, to the best of my knowledge, virtually every one of them agrees to do that.
While we’re also providing high-risk teachers and students options to engage in distance teaching or learning, we’re working on that also.  College-age students also continue to be one of the lowest-risk demographics.  More than 99.8 percent of the deaths from this horrible disease — “the invisible enemy,” we call it — occur in people over 24 years of age.  Think of that: 99.8 percent occur in people over 24 years of age.
For this reason, it could be safer for them to live at a school rather than live with their older parents or grandparents.  They got to go to school.  We got to open up.  We got to open up our schools and open up our businesses.  And a lot of it has been open, but we can do better.
As we move forward, the number of cases is not, by any means, the most important metric to focus on because the fact is we have more cases because we have far more testing than any country in the world.  There’s no country that’s even close.
We’ve done more testing and better testing than any country.  And many of these countries that the media was putting up as a shining example of success, they’re, right now, in massive outbreaks.  You see what’s going on in many of the countries that you constantly mention.
Far more important is who the virus is infecting.  That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require hospitalization or result in death — those that afflict the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions — all the while acting to prevent hospital overcrowding.
If you look at some of the states that had a flare-up recently, they’re all doing very well.  Florida is going down rapidly.  I want to give a lot of credit to the governors.  Florida is going down, and Arizona is going down, way down.  They’ve done a fantastic job.  California, as you know, is going down.  And many other locations — it’s doing very well.  And many locations are really in fantastic shape — some with very little, if any, problem — large portions of the United States.
Those advocating for a never-ending, blanket, nationwide lockdown have no answer for what it would do to the mental, physical, and social health of millions of American children and people.  This includes parents, where they have to stay home with their children because — and they lose their work and they lose their job because their children isn’t at school.  They have to have somebody to take care of it, and they want to take care of their child.  They don’t trust people.  A society must put the health and safety of our children first.
A man who has the respect of everybody — he’s highly respected by me and anybody on this subject.  He’s just the expert.  Dr. Scott Atlas is here from Stanford, and he’s been working with us for a period of time.  And I thought it would be great — he was saying things to me the other day.  I said it would be great if you could tell that to the media.
So this is the first time I’ve shared the platform.  And it’s an honor to do so.  Scott is truly — he’s a brilliant man.  He’s a wonderful man.  And he cares about the subject very much.  And I’d like to ask Scott to come up please and say a few words.
Thank you, Scott.
DR. ATLAS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s obviously a great honor to be here and a great honor to serve this President, who’s really focused on the very important parts of the pandemic.
And I’m new here.  I’m just, sort of, getting involved, but I want to thank you and the Vice President and the entire team, the task force team, and all the people who are not very visible, really, for working so hard.  These people are working 24/7, and it’s — it’s quite amazing.
And I think that we — today, we had a fantastic event, that I’ll just mention, on opening the schools, because the President’s priority is to open the schools and open them safely and have parents have the options to either use open schools or do whatever they can to eventually get back to open schools, including any kind of hybrid or other arrangement they may want to do.
It was a great event.  We had a group of fantastic parents, teachers, medical experts, and it went very well.  And so I won’t spend a lot of time up here, but thank you very much and I hope I can help out in some way.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Steve?  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-081320/

5:37 P.M.  EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Nice to be with you all.  Good evening. 
    Before providing today’s update on the China virus, I want to address the violence, looting, and rioting taking place in the Democrat-controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle.  The mayors and governors of these states and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death. 
    New York City has an army of great police.  I know them very well.  And the law enforcement and the New York’s Finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job.  If they do their job, if they’re allowed to do their job,   the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly.  They do it well. 
    The mayor, Bill de Blasio, should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired without justification.  They were fired.  I guess that’s part of “Defund the Police” by the Democrats.  They should hire New York City’s Finest back.  You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do, actually, when it comes to terrorism and other things. 
    Together, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs, and Guardsmen available to quell any violence.  They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs — again, if allowed to do their jobs.  Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do their jobs.  The Democrats or the radical-left Democrats — or both, because they’re becoming one and the same, if you look at election results — the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left. 
    The city of Portland and the state of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and Guardsmen available.  Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available.  So Seattle — the city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people.  They have to be allowed to do their job.  I’m urging them to deploy these resources to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on — although a lot of the, unfortunately, fake news don’t like to put it on because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement.  They have to put it on.  They have to be honest with the people of this country. 
    But I’m offering all available federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals.  We have to be asked by the governors or the mayors, and we’ll be there very rapidly.  It’s ready, willing, and able.  We’re all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them.  We’ll do them very quickly.  You saw what happened in Minneapolis; they ripped the city apart.  When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately.  It was immediate and lasted. 
    These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent, leftwing extremism that you get to see if you’re watching the right news program.  Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of leftwing domestic terrorism.  They really are anarchists.  These are leftwing anarchists.  They are anarchists.  And I’m directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists — immediately, to stop them — and to work with the city and the state to get the job done. 
    Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately.  We’ll work with you.  And the local authorities know who they are.  They know where they come from.  They know a lot about them.  They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we’re ready to help.  If you need that help — you shouldn’t need that help, actually.  You should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well.  Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job. 
    What you’re seeing in Portland and Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America.  They want every city in America to resemble Portland, in a form.  They want to pass federal legislation gutting and hamstringing every police department in America.  They want to get rid of your Second Amendment.  They want to end cash bail; close prisons; defund police departments — or at least largely defund.  You see that with New York.  A billion dollars they took out of their police department, and crime has gone through the roof.  And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens.  If the left gains power, no city, town, or suburb in our country will be safe. 
    On the vaccine front, some very good news.  Today, I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. 
    We heard an update from the top scientists and the government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which, right now, aren’t too thrilled with me.  They’re taking millions of dollars’ worth of ads because I’ve created a favored-nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70 percent in some cases — numbers that have never been heard or thought of.  So when you see those ads, remember: That means your drug prices are coming down.  When you see ads attacking your President, it’s very simple — that means drug prices are going to be falling very soon.
    This evening, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate.  The federal government will own these vaccine doses; we’re buying them. 
    Recently, we also secured partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to support the large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines.  Doing very well on those vaccines — tremendous promise in every single one of them, and we have many of them.  And they’re years ahead of schedule.  This would have been — if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years. 
    Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already — the final stage of clinical trials.  This is the final stage.  We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery.  The military is ready to go.  They’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA, and we’re moving very close to that approval. 
    We’re on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses, as soon as the vaccine is approved, and up to 500 million shortly thereafter.  So we’ll have 600 million doses.  Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history. 
    We’ve treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma.  A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results which are incredible.  We look to a reduction and reduced mortality rate by 50 percent, and possibly even more than 50 percent. 
    I urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate.  We would really appreciate that because it’s been very successful — unbelievably successful — and we would love you to go and donate.
    As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible.  You’ve seen the numbers.  You see what’s going on yesterday, today — and tomorrow, in my opinion.  We’re very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401(k) numbers and everything else.
    Today, the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time, more than a 50 percent surge since just March.  So we’ve increased by 50 percent more than since just March.  It has gained approximately 9,500 points that same period — March — and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our nation — think of that.
    America’s economy is incredible, and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations.  Last quarter, the European Union’s GDP decline was nearly 40 percent worse than the United States.  So it’s 40 percent worse than the United States.  We’ve built such a strong base that we’re able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world, by far.
    France’s GDP decline was nearly 80 percent worse than ours.  And Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States.
    Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic — very substantial improvements.  Since last week, 87 percent of the counties in the United States report declining cases.  Think of that: 87 percent of the counties in the United States, they reported declining cases.
    Mortality has declined by 7 percent, and hospitalizations are declining rapidly.  States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25 percent.  But all Americans must remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible.  Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask.  And protect the elderly — always protect the elderly. 
    Since the end of July, the seven-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20 percent, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe.
    Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in three months — not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media.  The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62 percent since last week, unfortunately — and that is truly unfortunate.  It’s increased 82 percent in France, 113 percent in Spain, and 30 percent in the United Kingdom.  Those are big increases.  Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries.  And in our country, they’re going down.  We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by — a short time. 
    Even though America is the largest at-risk population — including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries — Europe has experienced a nearly 40 percent higher excess mortality rate than the United States.  We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-state area — which had a very, very hard time — and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill — something that the news doesn’t tell you.  They don’t tell you that.  They don’t like to tell you that.
    The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world.  India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people, has done 24 million.  So we’re at 66 million.  And think of it: India is at 24 million, and India is second. 
    The entire region of Latin America, comprising 33 countries, has conducted 25 million tests.  Yet, Latin America has more confirmed cases, by far, than the United States. 
    As we safely restore our great economy and reopen our schools — and hopefully we can watch colleges play football.  We want to get football in colleges.  These are young, strong people.  They won’t have a big problem with the China virus.  So we want to see college football start, and, hopefully, a lot of great people are going to be out there.  They’re going to be out there, playing football, and they’ll be able to fight it off.  And hopefully, it won’t bother them one bit.  Most of them will never get it, statistically.  But we know we’ll see more cases at some point, and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity, in addition to everything else that we’re doing.
    So, college football, get out there and play football.  People want to see it.  And stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem because people are not happy when that doesn’t happen. 
    You look at the NBA and what’s happening with the NBA and their poor ratings.  I don’t know; can’t imagine why.  But they didn’t stand, they didn’t show respect to our flag.  They didn’t show respect to our anth- — our National Anthem.  And maybe that’s having an impact, but just not good.
    The NFL had its problems, two years ago, when that happened.  They went way down in their ratings and their fans, and they struggled back.  And now, all of a sudden, they’re putting themselves in the same position.  So stand for your flag and stand for the National Anthem, and I think you’re going to do fantastically well.  Because a lot of people aren’t going to watch if you don’t; I’m one of them.
    That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death.  We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population.  We’ve learned that, I think, more than any single event, Scott.  We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population, and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness — diabetes, in particular. 
    And we are, at the same time, in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding.  We’re in great shape.
    On the nursing-home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy.  HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities as they continue to combat the China virus. 
    We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes.  And we’re in the process of delivering these vice- — devices to all 15,000 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes by the end of September.  So they’re going to have very, very rapid tests.  They won’t have to wait around two or three days or four days. 
    And that number has come down very substantially, compared to what it was.  When you send it to the labs, you get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it, and then to send it back.  But we are now at a position where we’re sending very, very rapid tests — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.
    We will care for America’s seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics.  And therapeutics are coming along very, very well.  We think we have some great answers on therapeutics, and you’ll be hearing that — about them in the very near future.  I’m very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital, and you give a shot, or you do what you have to do with a, perhaps, transfusion.  There’s combinations of what you can do, and people get better.  I like that very much.  I like that very, very much. 
    And that could even precede — and it’s successful in getting it — that will, I think, probably, even precede vaccines.  But therapeutically, we’re doing very, very well.  A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that we’re — that I’m seeing, and some of the results. 
    So, tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front, and our country should be very proud of itself.  We’re going to get it delivered very rapidly, as soon as it comes out.

    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I thought I’d start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed — just the news.  Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the state of Virginia, including to many dead people.  This was an unprecedented mailing flub that’s heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts.  It’s a disaster — all over Virginia, half a million votes.  So that’s something you have to think about. 
    We don’t want to have a rigged election, I know that.  And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia or you mention China or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system.  And when you have this mail-in voting, it’s a — it’s very susceptible.  It’s something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans.  And I think that it’s something you have to start thinking about very seriously. 
    Our system is not equipped for it.  The Post Office is not equipped for it.  And people should vote, like they did in World War One and World War Two.  And your numbers will be — in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think — much better — on the coronavirus or the China virus.  But it’s something you have to look about — look at and say, “This is just crazy.” 
    This just came out: half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the state of Virginia to many people that weren’t living.  They had some sent to pets — dogs.  This is what we’re going to get into, and it’s going to be a disaster.  And it’s going to be thought of very poorly, and it’s going to hurt our country. 
    After our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement — we’re pro-jobs, pro-health safety — executive orders — the stock market went up 358 points today.  So we — we issued those executive orders, and the stock market went up 358 points today.  It’s quite a reaction.
    The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50 percent since March — 50 percent.  Think: If you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you have 50 percent.  The Nasdaq index continues to set new records.  It’s been up over 14 times; new record in Nasdaq. 
    And the S&P 500 and the Dow — Dow Jones are going to be — I mean, the way they’re going, it looks like they’re just about going to be topping records, hopefully, soon.
    SECRET SERVICE AGENT:  Sir, we’re just going to have to step out in the hall (inaudible).
    THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me?

     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Democrats in Congress failed to act in the best interests of Americans hardest hit by this pandemic.  Amid inaction, President Trump stood up for every American who, through no fault of their own, needed relief.
     Politics as usual should find no place during this pandemic, but Democrats rejected multiple clean bills to provide relief.  The American people are tired of games.  They seek leadership, and President Trump delivered.
     This weekend, President Trump took executive action designed to provide the relief Democrats have denied to those who need it most.  Through four executive orders, he took the following steps:
     On the payroll tax, he deferred payments of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st through the end of 2020. 
     On unemployment assistance, states will provide 25 percent cost sharing, amounting to a total of $400 per week in benefits through the end of the year.
     And then, third, he extended the eviction protections.  President Trump will direct HUD to prevent evictions resulting from financial hardships caused by the virus, doing everything in his executive capacity to make sure those renting and those homeowners are protected.
     Finally, on student loans, he extended 0 percent interest and suspended loan payments through the end of the year.
     The bottom line is that these actions will help Americans.  President Trump is for the American people, and Democrats failed to deliver.
     Also, earlier this year, hundreds of Americans — working men and women — at the Tennessee Valley Authority — the TVA — were told that they would lose their jobs to lower-paid foreign workers imported from abroad, and then ser- — suffered the further indignity of training their foreign replacements.
     President Trump boldly and resolutely intervened in defense of these hardworking Americans — rallying to their case, rushing to their aid, and taking action to restore their jobs.  He invited laid-off workers and their representatives to the White House, and then he fired the chairman of the board of the TVA and one other board member.
     President Trump offered an ultimatum: The firings would continue until the cruel and heartless decision to fire the hardworking Americans was reversed.  TVA did reverse.  Layoffs have been canceled, and tech workers have been rehired. 
     In the words of Gay Henson, president of the Engineering Associates, IFPTE, Local 1937 — the labor union representing the 2- — the 2,200 highly skilled professionals employed by the TVA — in Ms. Henson’s words, “The President’s personal intervention saved these jobs, restored the workers to their rightful place, and set TVA on the path to returning to its mission of service to both the workers at the TVA and to the people of this country.”
     And, with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-10-2020/

Bedminster, New Jersey

4:21 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you, and good afternoon.  My administration has been working around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats on additional China virus relief.
Already, my administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief, saving many tens of millions of dollars and jobs.  And you see how fast the economy is coming back.  It does look like it’s going to be a very sharp “V.”  We have tremendous enthusiasm, tremendous spirit, and tremendous job growth.  We set a record on number of jobs in the last three months.  It’s the most jobs ever created in a three-month period — during a three-month period.  That’s great.
Before we begin, I’ve just signed two bills that are great for our vets.  Our vets are very special.  We passed Choice, as you know — Veterans Choice — and Veterans Accountability.  And they’ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no President has ever been able to do it.  And we got it done so veterans have Choice.  And now you have Accountability — that if you don’t love your vets, if you’re in the VA and you don’t love the vets or take care of the vets, you can actually get fired if you don’t do your job.  We want people that love our vets.
The first expands the eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes.  So we have an expansion of benefits, an expansion of various elements of being and working with the VA for vets with blindness and — in particular, blindness in both eyes.  And we have a lot of problems with blindness in the VA, and we’re doing something about it.  They’ve been talking about this for many years.  So that is expanding eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes.  Okay?
Second is — requires the VA to establish a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes.  And you know what that all means, and it’s really something that they’ve been trying to get done for a long time.  The second requires the VA to establish a treatment court.  So this is a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes.  Okay?  I think it’s self-explanatory.
We’ve wanted this for a long time, they’ve been trying to get it for a long time, and now we have it.  And I want to thank everybody for helping us get that done.  We had a lot of support from a lot of great people, including people in the VA.
In the current negotiations, we have repeatedly stated our willingness to immediately sign legislation providing expanded unemployment benefits, protecting Americans from eviction, and providing additional relief payments to families.  Democrats have refused these offers; they want to negotiate.  What they really want is bailout money for states that are run by Democrat governors and mayors, and that have been run very badly for many, many years — and many decades, in fact.  You know the states; everybody knows who we’re talking about and what we’re talking about.  I don’t think we have to go over it.
But what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money.  It has nothing to do with the China virus.  It has nothing to do with anything that we’ve been talking about over the last period of time.  They want to bailout states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years — and, in fact, in all cases, many decades.  And we’re not willing to do that.
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demands and the radical-left Democrats, and we just can’t do that.  So, hopefully, we can do something with them at a later date, but we’re going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important, and will take care of, pretty much, this entire situation.
As we know it and as you have been covering it in some cases — actually covering it accurately — many of the far-left policies they’re pushing have nothing to do, again, with what we have been working on so hard — namely, the corona.  You can call it so many different names.  What a horrible thing China released upon the world.
One third of their bill — the HEROES Act — is spending completely unrelated money to the virus.  Here are just a few of the policies in their extreme-left bill.  And, again, this is a bill supported by Biden, and Biden is totally controlled now by the Bernie Sanders left wing of the party.  And, in fact, he’s gone further left than Bernie Sanders ever dreamt of going.  So, obviously, other than Bernie have brought him left.  If you look at the manifesto that they’ve agreed to, it’s far further left than I’ve ever heard anything about Bernie Sanders.
The massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states we talked about — that’s one of the things they’re looking to do.  Measures designed to increase voter fraud.  Banning voter ID; they want to ban voter ID.  We should have voter ID in every state.  Every state should have voter ID.  You have ID on everything you do, practically, yet every- — everybody has voter ID.  Everybody has ID except for voters.  When you vote, you don’t want ID; they don’t want —
We have some states with it; it works out great.  And if you want to stop fraud in elections, have voter ID.  They want measures designed to increase voter fraud, which is banning voter ID in all states and banning requirements for signature verification in federal elections.
Now, why would they want, in this bill — which really has nothing to do with what we’re talking about: stimulus — something banning voter ID?  In every single state, they want to ban it, including states where we already have it, because we have some states where we have it — Indiana and others that do very well.
Why would they want to ban voter ID in all states?  And why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in federal election?  Who would want a bill banning signature verification?  What’s that all about?
You know what it’s about?  Fraud.  That’s what they want: fraud.  They want to try and steal this election because, frankly, it’s the only way they can win the election.
The bill also requires all states to do universal mail-in balloting — which nobody is — nobody is prepared for — regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure.  They want to steal an election.  That’s all this is all about: They want to steal the election.
So, in the bill, they have a bill that requires all states to do universal mail-in balloting, regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure.  Like in Nevada, it’s such a disaster.  Their infrastructure is a total disaster.  They don’t want to have signature verification, they don’t want to have any of the safeguards that you need, and they don’t want to have safeguards that are so common and so basic and even other states that we disagree with have.  This Nevada thing is a mess, but we’ll see how the courts determine — what the courts determine.  But they certainly don’t have the infrastructure in Nevada.  So we’ll see how it is.
As you know, we brought suit last week, and we’ll see how that all works out.  I think we’re going to win it.  But, basically, what they’re trying to do with all of these requirements, including no signature verification: They’re trying to steal an election.
And I was in Ohio, I was in Texas, I was in Florida over the last four or five days.  And if you would see the crowds along the highways and the roadways, people have said they’ve never seen anything like it, and they haven’t seen anything like it.  And the press doesn’t report it because they’re fake news.
They even want to force states to implement the controversial practice known as “ballot harvesting” — a very dangerous practice — meaning they would allow Democrat Party operatives to deposit thousands and thousands of completed ballots at the post office without any verification of who filled them out, including a verification of signatures on the ballots.  So you’re not even going to have a verified signature.  Anybody — I could sign it.  You could sign it.  Anybody in this room could sign it.  And that’s going to count as a vote.  How can you do a thing like this?
So this is what they’re asking for.  This is what Nancy Pelosi and Crying Chuck Schumer are asking for.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay?  It’s ridiculous.  It’s horrible.  It’s a horrible thing.
The Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.  So if you were able to get into our country illegally — and our border is, as you know, doing very well right now.  We have a very strong border, and the wall is up to 276 miles.  And we’ll be completed with it around the end of the year.  We’re going to do some extra mileage in certain areas that people didn’t realize were so bad, so we’ll be completed with it.  Right after, we’re going to do the additional mileage.  We’ll do it probably a little bit after the year.
I think, from what I’ve heard, Joe Biden — Sleepy Joe — wants to rip the wall down.  He wants people to pour into our country.  They want to have open borders.  We don’t want to have open borders.
So the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.  They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention.  They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons.  How do you like that one?  And this is in the bill that we’re talking about?  What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy?  What does this have to do with the coronavirus?  Another name.  What does this have to do with this?
So, think of that: They required the mass release of illegal aliens from detention.  What does this have to do with what we’re trying to do?  They want to put this — and this is a radical-left policy, so they can go to Portland and try and rip the place apart that they’ve been doing for many years and they’ve been doing for years and years.
They also compel the mass release of inmates.  What does this have to do with what we’re talking about?  This is Nancy Pelosi — Crazy Nancy — and Chuck Schumer.  They want to compel you to do this stuff, and this has nothing to do with what we’re talking about, and it includes serious felons.  They want to have these people released on a mass basis, including serious felons.
That’s page 1,689; page 1,762.  Think of it: 1,762.  And that’s nowhere near the end of their bill.  They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read.  These people — I don’t — I honestly don’t believe they love our country, you want to know the truth.
In addition to demanding these extreme partisan provisions, Democrats are actively blocking the following measures: support for K-12 schools to help them safely open, additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to help millions of workers on the payroll.  This is a great program.  Very successful.  Kept a lot of businesses open.  That’s why we’re doing so well in reopening our country.  Additional money for hospitals.  Testing and vaccines.  Direct payments of $3,400 for a family of four.
Now, remember, this is what the extreme partisans — this — we got — we have to — this is what we’re talking about.  Democrats are actively blocking the things that we want.  And what we want is good for people.  Those — these are things that they’re blocking: support for K-12 schools, so they can open.  Think of that.
Also, direct payments of the $3,400 for a family of four-plus, then funding for childcare and mental health care.  And you need that, especially when you have so much of a lockdown.  You need that: mental health care.
Funding for broadband, airports, and agriculture, rental assistance, and support for community banks and credit unions to help them provide $100 billion in loans to the hardest-hit communities, including rural communities and farmers.  They don’t want anybody to get that.  Democrats are obstructing all of it.
Therefore, I’m taking executive action.  We’ve had it.  And we’re going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers, and I’ll be signing these bills in a very short period of time.
First one is on providing a payroll tax holiday to Americans earning less than $100,000 per year.  In a few moments, I will sign a directive, instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st.  And we’re actually going to be making that; we just got the word.  We’re just getting some word from a lot of people.  We didn’t think we’d have to do this because we thought the Democrats would be reasonable, but they’ve been not only unreasonable, they’ve been ridiculous.
So we’re going to make that August 1st, most likely.  It’ll be August 1st.  We’ll let you know the exact date, but we’re looking like August 1st.  So it’d be August 1st through the end of 2020.  This will mean bigger paychecks for working families, as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the China virus once and for all.
And we’re doing very good with the numbers.  You see it’s going down in Arizona very, very substantially and rapidly.  Going down in California.  Going down in Texas.  Going down in Florida.  Other areas are propping up a little bit, but we’re watching them very closely.  We understand the disease, and we’re watching them very closely, especially our senior citizens and our senior citizens’ residences.
If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.  So I’m going to make them all permanent.
Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that.  They don’t want that because they’re adding $3 trillion in taxes.  So they’ll have the option of raising everybody’s taxes and taking this away.
But if I win, I may extend and terminate.  In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.  And so, we’ll see what happens.  Biden probably won’t be doing that; you’ll have to ask him.  I don’t think he knows what he’s doing.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter and applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Second, I’m signing an executive order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS, and CDC to make sure renters and homeowners can stay in their homes.
So I’m protecting people from eviction.  Yet you’ve been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction.  I said, “Let’s do that separately.  That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live.”  And they didn’t even want to protect people from eviction.
So, they would get evicted — it’s not their fault that this virus came into our country; it’s China’s fault.  And came into the world — by the way, a lot of the people, a lot of the states that were doing the best are having some problems.  A lot of the states that we weren’t thinking were doing the best are doing very well.
You look at some of the countries involved.  Some of the countries that were really standing out as examples are now exploding.  But they’ll get it down; they understand it.  We’re dealing with them.  We’re dealing with a lot of countries.
We’re providing thousands and thousands of ventilators all over the world right now.  We make a lot of ventilators.  We started off with very little, and we’re making a lot.  And we have thousands in our stockpile, but we’re making thousands a month.  And we’re providing many of them — thousands and thousands — to other countries that would never be able to get them.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, and work with landlords and lenders to keep Americans safely in their homes.  So we don’t want people being evicted.  And the bill — the act that I’m signing will solve that problem, largely — hopefully, completely.
The third action I’m taking today will also provide additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus.  Under the CARES Act, I proudly signed expanded unemployment benefits into law.  Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief.  They even oppose measures that would give bonuses to workers returning to the job.  They were totally opposed to that.
For this reason, I’m taking action to provide an additional or an extra $400 per week in expanded benefits: $400.  Okay?  So, that’s generous, but we want to take care of our people.  Again, it wasn’t their fault; it was China’s fault.
States will be asked to cover 25 percent of the cost using existing funding, such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the Coronavirus Relief Fund.  Under this plan, states will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose, and the federal government will cover 75 percent of the cost.  So we’re all set up.  It’s $400 per week.
And we’re doing that without the Democrats.  We should have been able to do it very easily with them, but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people.
Fourth, I am signing a directive providing relief to student loan borrowers.  Earlier this year, we slashed student loan interest rates to zero.  I don’t know if people know that because the press doesn’t ever report it, but maybe they’re watching now.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  The press doesn’t report a lot of good things that are good for the people and good for the country.
Earlier this year, we slashed student loans’ interest rates to zero percent and suspended student loan payments, and Congress extended that policy through September 30th.  Today, I’m extending this policy through the end of the year, and we’ll extend it further than that — most likely, right after December 1st.  So we look like we’re going to be extending that.  They’re paying zero interest.  And again, not their fault that their colleges are closed down and not their fault that they’re unable to get what they bargained for.
Through these four actions, my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to Americans struggling in this difficult time.  And the beautiful thing about this difficult time is we’re now coming back and setting records.
We’ll also ensure that our economic comeback continues full speed ahead.  And with the $400 and all of the other measures that we’re talking about and will be signing in a little while, that will happen.
We’re further looking at additional tax cuts, including income tax relief, income tax cuts, and capital gains tax cuts.  So we’re going to be looking at that — capital gains — for the purpose of creating jobs, and income tax is self-explanatory.  And it’ll be income tax for middle-income and lower-income people, but middle-income people because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality.  I’m saying that as a Republican, and you do have tax inequality.
So we’re going to be looking at income tax, and we’re going to be looking at capital gains tax cuts on both, and maybe substantial.  And we’ll be reporting back fairly shortly on that.  That’s big news.  That’s big news, but very important.  We want to have our jobs flourish.  We want to have our companies do great.  We want to have the 401(k)s, which are now at a level — if you look at the stock market, it’s great.
If you have stocks in NASDAQ, you’re higher than you ever were, including even — this is still during the pandemic.  The stock market — because they see such incredible things are happening, smart people — the stock market is that almost an all-time high.  We’re just short of it.  And NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/

August 7, 2020
7:34 P.M. EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And it’s a great honor to have everybody here.  And I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend.  We have a terrific number of things, and some very positive things to tell you tonight. 
    I want to begin by giving an update on the economy.  Economic health is vital to public health.  That’s why our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school.  Very important. 
    We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May.  And I will say that the job growth that we’ve seen over the last three months — 9.3 million — is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history.  That’s big stuff.  That’s big news and great news. 
    Over the past three months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs.  Over the last three months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs.  Remember “You’d need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs”?  And we’re getting them even in a pandemic — which is disappearing; it’s going to disappear. 
    And 639,000 brand-new construction jobs.  Over half of the new jobs are fulltime jobs, and wages are up by 4.8 percent, which is terrific.  Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30 percent since April.  Think of that: 30 percent since April. 
    Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32 percent.  Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns — incredibly hard — increased by nearly 1 million over the past three months, and that’s also a record.  That’s a job record: African American, 1 million.  It’s job record.
    We must ensure that the progress continues.  My administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world.  So we’ve contributed $3 trillion.
    My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits; provide protections against evictions — the terrible thing happens with evictions.  Not fair.  It wasn’t their fault that we were infected with this disease from China.  And get relief to American families. 
    Yet, tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical leftwing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus.  Nothing to do with it at all.  So you have a virus that comes in, and you have people in Congress that don’t want to help our people. 
    If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act, under my authority as President, to get Americans the relief they need.  And what we’re talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months until the end of the year.  And I can extend it at a certain period.  Hopefully, I will be here to do the job.  We’re going to do the job; we’ve been doing the job like nobody could.  Nobody would, actually.  And so, we’re going to have the payroll tax go until the end of the year, and it’ll be retroactive to July 1st.  So we’re going to go back to July 1st, and it’ll go to the end of the year — payroll tax.  At the end of the year, it may be extended.
    We’re going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year.  So unemployment benefits will be — that’s a big one — will be brought out to the end of the year. 
    And defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice — so students who are paying student loans and, in many cases, they’re not even allowed to go back into their colleges.
    Extend the eviction moratorium — we will be extending that so people aren’t evicted.  Not their fault. 
    We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France, concerning numerus subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon.  Horrible, horrible event.
    At 3 p.m. this afternoon, I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft on the — are on the way, and they’re fully loaded — fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things, lots of emergency equipment.  Also first responders, technicians, doctors, and nurses are on their way.  This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time.  A horrible event.
    We’ll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world.  Everyone wants to help.  We spoke to a lot of people; they all want to help. 
    The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come.  We’re working very closely with their government and with their leaders.
    And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families — a much larger number of families than anybody would have thought and than anybody at first thought — but all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy.  We stand firmly with the people of Lebanon and will continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time.  We have not seen anything like this in a long time.
    As you know, earlier this week I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority who have been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority.  As you know, this is a form of utility.  It’s been around for a long time, since FDR. 
    And the head person — not controlled by government, but it’s sort of semi-public, in a sense — gets paid the highest salary in the world of government.  He gets $8 million a year.  That’s not a bad amount of money.  It’s $8 million a year.  And we are not accepting that.  Even though we’re not the ones that appoint him or her — but, in this case, him — we’re not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year.  This has been going on for many years.  And we will do something about that, and we’re already in negotiations right now, including possible termination. 
    They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers — the workers at TVA — were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this, and on top of the $8 million salary, and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year.  But, on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions — these incredible people — in order to train the lower-cost foreign workers imported to replace them.  How’s that for a law?  And this was set up, originally, to create jobs and economic development, and now they’re getting fired, and they’re supposed to train people for a much lower — who get a much lower salary.  It’s crazy.
    This was a grave injustice.  I fired the chairman of the board in response.  On Friday, I fired the chairman of the board, along with one other board member.  That’s the one thing we have; we have the right to fire board members.  And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the board members.  And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course, totally. 
    And today, I’m proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee and Kentucky and other areas that are covered — great states, great states — that the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back.  They’re being rehired as we speak.
    In this administration, we live by two rules: Buy American and hire American.  You can’t do that; you can’t fire all our workers and hire people back from other faraway parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people.  And they can never train them as good as what you have, because they’ve been there for many years.  They’ve done a fantastic job, and they love the TVA. 
    We had a lot of people in the office the other day — a lot of the media was covering it.  They love the Tennessee Valley Authority.  So — and they’re so proud to work for it.  But this happened and it was a terrible thing, so now they’re going to get their jobs back — they’re all going to be getting their jobs back.
    Nearly every nation on Earth continues to combat the virus.  A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe.  Cases continue to surge in Latin America.  That’s, right now, the most infected place anywhere in the world.  They have more than doubled in recent days.  Latin America is doing very little testing.  They’re not really equipped to do that.  It’s tough. 
    In the United States, more than 80 percent of jurisdictions report decline in cases.  We’re doing very well.  You don’t hear that too often from the media, but we’re doing very well.  We have a very large country — a very complex country, in a sense.  More than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week.  So, if you look at that, more than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week.  But we have to remain vigilant.  We’re doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.
    Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July.  The southern states that were very strong hotspots not long ago — Arizona, Texas, Florida — continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hos- — hospital beds. 
    Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus in-patients.  Since mid-June, it’s gone — the governor was up, and we had a great meeting — Governor Ducey.  And the meeting was terrific.  But since mid-June — so they’re doing well, and it’s going down — heading down very rapidly, actually.
    Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley, and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths.
    Florida is also stabilizing, and statewide positive test rate continues to decrease — from 13 percent on July 23rd, to 8 percent this week.  Florida has done very well.  It’s going down; it’s heading down, actually, quite rapidly.  And even Miami, which was the hottest spot in Florida, is heading downward.  But Florida has done very well.
    Texas has done very well, and rapidly.  And Arizona has done incredibly well.  So it — Arizona has really been a very rapid drop.
    New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1 percent of emergency room visits due to the China virus — the illness.  It took a devastating toll on both states, as you know.  While both states really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year, thankfully we have not seen a resurgence.  They’ve been doing a good job.  Everybody is working very hard.  Both governors are working very, very hard.  We’re in touch with them.  We’re supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed, if needed.  But they’re needing very little right now.  They’re in very good shape.  We will continue to monitor the new cases.
    Throughout this crisis, my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York, and to the people of every state — all of our states. 
    We’re carefully monitoring California’s Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. 
    We’re carefully watching regions from increasing cases, including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest.  We’re watching them all very carefully.  It’s vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable. 
    For this reason, we’ve delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America.  We’re focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems.  Diabetes is a big problem.  Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.  That’s an incredible number, when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. 
    And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes, and they are very, very vigilant.  They’re doing a very good job now.  They’ve really done something that I think is special.  They’re doing very well, in terms of the virus.  They’re working very hard.  And a lot of things happen — a lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard.  But the representatives of nursing homes — in some cases, the ownership of nursing homes — they’re working very hard.
    The federal government and the private sector have delivered more than 9 million N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns, and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone.  Think of that.  We provided $3.4 billion to the state of New Jersey in emergency relief funding.  So we happen to be in New Jersey right now, so those are great numbers.  The governor is working very hard; Governor Murphy is doing a good job.  We’re working very closely with him.  We’ve also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and healthcare facilities. 
    And through the Paycheck Protection Program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses.  A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well, they’re there because of what we did with Paycheck Protection.
    On therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials.  This would be years ahead of schedule.  We have done wonders with the FDA.  I want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn.  But we have phase three trials already going on, which is, most people would have said, impossible to even think about. 
    Today, Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead’s drug, remdesivir — where we’ve had tremendous success.
    Last week alone, my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients.  Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what’s going on.  And if you can go to a blood bank — if you’ve had this disease and — and beat it — and there are a lot of people that have — if you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help.
    The United States is only 5 percent of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25 percent of the world’s testing.  Think of that: 5 percent and we’ve given 25 percent of the world’s testing.  Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we’re constantly showing cases — cases, cases, cases are up.  Well, the reason cases are up, because we’re doing — one of the reasons — we’re doing a lot of testing. 
    We’re doing much more testing than anyone else.  Close to 65 million tests, where other countries have done very little testing.  They’ll test people if they get sick.  They’ll test people if they go into the hospital.  They’ll test certain people.  We’re doing tremendous testing.  And we’re especially doing big testing at the nursing homes. 
    Over the last week, the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pooling samples.  And we’ve also been able to send out many more of the tests, which are the 5-minute to 15-minute-result tests.  Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we’re very focused on and doing.  But in the not-too-distant future, we’ll have so many tests where it’s a quick test — they call it a “quick test” — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.  So we won’t even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving.  Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and, let’s say, a day at the laboratory — that’s three days right there.  And the other tests, you can have them in 5 to 15 minutes.
    Over the next two weeks, I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers.  That’s a big thing.  I’ve always been very strongly in favor — we have to cover pre-existing conditions.  So we will be pursuing a major executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all of its customers. 
    This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of. 
    This follows a series of executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices — and significantly.  We had the only year, which was last year, where drug prices went down in 51 years.  But we’re talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now, even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that’s usually a reason — they’re not happy.  They can’t be too thrilled.  But they’ve made a lot of money over the years, and prices just go up.  Not fair. 
    This includes a landmark executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans — and charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries.  So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries.  That means our country can’t be charged more. 
    So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price, and we’re paying many times that price in the United States — because we pay for all of the research, the development, the promotion, and other things — we will get what’s called a “favored-nations clause.”  We’re going to have — and I signed a favored-nations clause so that the United States — which is the number-one purchaser of drugs by far in the world — biggest purchaser in the world, not even close.  You have other countries that are bigger, if you look at India, China, et cetera.  Not too many.  But we have countries that are bigger, but not even close, in terms of ordering drugs.  We’re the number-one country in the world. 
    But we have a favored-nation — so if somebody has a — a drug — in many cases, it comes from a plant — the same plant.  It comes from — it’s the same pill; it’s the same medicine or medication.  Whatever the lowest country charges — so if Germany charges 10 cents for a pill, and we charge $2 — and I only use Germany as an example — then we get that — we get that for 10 cents.  So what’s going to happen is that’s going to go up a little bit, and ours is going to come down a whole lot.  So it’s the favored nations.
    And I will tell you that big pharma is not happy.  For too long, we’ve been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries.  We’ve subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe.  Nobody talked about it.  Everybody wondered, “How come every President that runs for office says they’re going to lower drug prices, and they never do?  They go through the right — roof.”  Over the last administration they went up, like, skyrocketing — skyrocketing.  That’s Biden.  Biden is not going to be able to be able to do it.  He has no clue. 
    So what’s happening is: We are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands.  And we’re going to give, essentially, all of the benefit that, frankly, they have as great negotiators — those benefits are going to go to our people.  So it’s called a “favored-nations clause,” and you can look it up, and you can see.  And nobody has had the courage to institute it, to call it because it’s a very big — it’s a very big step.  But it’s something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent.  We’re talking about numbers that are unbelievable. 
    I also signed an executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves.  These are some of the richest people in the world.  Everyone talked about middlemen.  I’ve heard about them for years, on prescription drug prices — middlemen.  I guess you’d have to say to be politically correct, “middlemen and women.”  But you never heard the “middlewomen” before; you heard “middlemen.”  That’s the term. 
    And, you know, say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product.  They produce the pill.  They produce the medicine — the medication.  But these people make billions and billions of dollars.  I don’t know who they are, but they’re very rich.  But they won’t be so rich anymore. 
    This executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients.  So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I’m going to lose a lot of friends, even though I have no idea who these people are. 
    AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.) 
    THE PRESIDENT:  On opioids, I’m pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America.  In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic.  And we’ve done very well.  We’ve done — it was prior to the virus — we were down 18, 19, and 20 percent.  But when you think about it, that means that you have 80 percent, and that’s not acceptable. 
    The wall is going up.  We have 276 miles of wall.  It’s having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already.  It’ll be finished toward the end of the year.  And it’s had a very, very big impact.
    On Portland: Finally, I’d like to address that situation.  Portland is a disaster.  It’s been a disaster for many, many years.  Brave federal law enforcement officers singlehandedly — the officers, they singlehandedly saved the federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists — and that’s what they are.  You know, when you find Molotov cocktails in somebody’s knapsack, and they say, “No, I’m just here to have a good time.”  (Laughter.)  These are really sick, disturbed people.
    The disgraced mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob.  He was at the mercy of the mob, too.  If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible.  He went out there and they wanted to rip him apart.  But, fortunately, he had five people with him called “security.”
    Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob.  As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down — an act of attempted murder.  Leftwing, violent extremism poses an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it.  You have no idea how much we stop, but it’s an ideology we have to stop.
    “When you commit arson…” — this is a quote from the mayor; he’s come a long way.  He just made this quote.  “When you commit arson with an accelerant in [the] attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who…have intentionally [been] trapped inside, you are not a” demonstrator — or “you’re not demonstrating,” said, Mayor 2722, “You are attempting to commit murder.”  That’s come a long way; he’s come a long way when he made that statement. 
    What you’re seeing in Portland is the radical left’s agenda in action.  Portland is their roadmap for America.  If the radical left gets in — and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet; he’s merely a puppet.  But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want.  That’s what they want.  Why?  Who knows?  Doesn’t matter.  It’s a different thinking, but it’s a mess. 
    And I want to thank Homeland Security.  They’ve done a fantastic job.  We had our people go in.  They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse, and the courthouse was saved, and other federal buildings were saved.  And we would like to be asked by the mayor and the governor — we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours, just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city.  But the National Guard went in, did a phenomenal job. 
    It was over in three hours.  After watching six days of horror, it ended in three hours.  You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street, just to — it was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things. 
    So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately, but we are supposed to be asked.  If we’re not asked and if it continues, we’ll have to make a decision.  But it’s a very easy thing for us to do.  We could stop it very quickly.  It’s been going on now for 76 days.  But our buildings are very secure.
    If the Democrats controlled in Washington — the Democrats’ control of Washington — they’d pass — with all of the things they do — legislation gutting every single police department in America.  They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department.  At a minimum, they’re to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department.
    No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe.  Your suburbs would be a disaster.  Your cities, your towns would be a disaster.  They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we’re waiting for the mayor.  We’ve sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we’re waiting for them to call — the governor, the mayor.  We could do a very good job in Chicago.  Nobody’s ever seen anything like that — this country. 
    And yet, nationwide numbers are good, despite the Chicagos and the Portlands — and, frankly, the New Yorks, when you look at what’s happened in New York.  Three hundred and forty-eight percent increase in the last number of months.  Nobody has seen anything like that.  It’s so sad.  To me, it’s so sad because I love New York.  And it’s so sad.  And it — all it is, is horrible, horrible incompetent management by politicians that truly don’t know what they’re doing.
    So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America.  And a vast majority of people agree with me.  A vast majority.  Most people.  They don’t speak up as much as they could, but we know they’re there, and everybody else knows they’re there, too. 
    So, with that, I’ll take a few questions from the media.  They’ve been here for a long time, and they’ve been waiting outside for a long time.  And they wait for these moments.  So it was a lot of fun.  (Laughter.)
    Please, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-bedminster-nj/

6:07 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Let me begin by sending America’s deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed, hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut.  Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families.  The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon.  I have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon, and we will be there to help.  It looks like a terrible attack.
     I also want to provide the latest on Tropical Storm Isaias.  Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East Coast, and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible.  I spoke to Governor Cooper, I spoke to Governor DeSantis, and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA, and they’re working very hard.
     Coastal areas in the storm’s path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents, while inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds.  FEMA is responding to states that have requested the assistance.  We have a list of those states; we can give them to you in a little while.  And my administration is monitoring the situation very closely.
     We have the military on guard, but we have — FEMA is there, in all cases.  The Corps of Engineers is ready if needed — the Army Corps of Engineers.  Very talented people.  I urge everyone in the storm’s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities.
     I now want to update you on the path forward, having to do with the China virus.  Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers, which are rather spectacular, that just came out.  The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management — that’s “ISM”; most of you know it by “ISM” — increased for the third month in a row, rising nearly 2 points in July to 54.2 — that’s fantastic — the highest reading since March of 2019. 
     This is remarkable, considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest, in particular, virus hotspots.  The ISM measures — and it’s a very strong measure of new orders.  It rose 5 points in July, to 61.5, in its highest rating, that would be, since September of 2018.  That’s a big number. 
     Since the April low, new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM, dating back all the way to 1948.  So, 34 points — that’s the largest since 1948. 
     Similarly, the ISM’s measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest 3-month gain in over 70 years.  That’s some — some number.
These were somewhat surprising, but I’ve been saying we’re doing well, and those numbers are really spectacular. 
     Automobile sales, likewise, are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up, stunningly.  It’s a 65 percent increase since then, to 14.5 million units, which is a — a massive number. 
     The great strength and great news is really for states like — in particular, Michigan; and Ohio; South Carolina; Pennsylvania, very good; Florida, little bit.  These are great numbers.  Record-setting numbers. 
     The strength in new car sales is also evident in the used car market, where soaring demand — literally, soaring demand — is putting upward pressure on the used car prices.  This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry.  The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector — and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers.  We’re very, very happy with these numbers.  And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers, in a very positive way.
     Economy-wide inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter.  A crash, in that case, means a good thing, not a bad thing.  That’s the largest drop ever on record — ever. 
     Homebuilder sentiment, likewise, is soaring, as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year.  And new homes recently made a 13-year high.  So we have a 13-year high in new home — new home construction. 
     New business applications are very strong.  That just came out.  The widely followed Atlanta Fed GDP — and it’s something that they have just come out with — now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates.  It looks like it’s showing a 20 percent annualized growth in the current quarter.  So 20 percent in the current quarter; we’ll take that all day long.  I — let’s see if that’s right.  That’s a projection.  So we’ll see if that’s right.  The Atlanta Fed — very respected. 
     The virus — back to that — we are continuing to monitor and monitor, in particular, hotspots across the South, Southwest, and the West.  And we’re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well, actually, especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for — ever since we’ve gotten to understand this horrible, horrible plague that’s been unleashed on our country by China.
     As of yesterday, cases are declining in 70 percent of the jurisdictions, compared to 36 percent last Monday.  That’s a big, big number.  Eleven out of thirteen states with the positive rate above 10 percent have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July.  In other states, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always is strong, even though the numbers are getting very good — states that have a test positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent.  And in the states with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. 
     We must ensure that these states do not become new flare-ups, so we’re watching them very, very closely.  Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths.
     Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak.  So the death — the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level.  One is too much — one death — because this should have never happened to us.  It should have been stopped at — very easily, by China, in Wuhan.  
     Thanks to our major advances in treatment, we’ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups.  Compared to April, mortality rates are 85 percent lower among individuals aged 18 to 69, and 70 percent lower among individuals over 70 years old.
     We’ve also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly.  Approximately 85 percent of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65 — just getting some very accurate numbers on this.  And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications.
     Since the pandemic began, nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted-living centers.  That’s an incredible statistic, when you hear that number.  This data, underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk.
     As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly, and we’re doing that.  We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense.  And those with underlining [sic] conditions, especially the elderly with the underlining [sic] — whether it’s heart or diabetes — they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems.  While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school.
     Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately, and that’s what we’re doing.  This is the science-based approach, and it’s good with us.  Working very hard on that.  An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest-risk populations, while inflicting massive economic pain, long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. 
     So there won’t be lockdowns, but we watch specific areas.  We’re very careful and we’re putting out embers.  We’re putting out flames.  When you look at what’s happening with Miami, and it’s going — the numbers are going down.  But Florida is going down very significantly.  Texas and California are going down rather significantly.
     On telemedicine, as we discussed the last time, as — and as I said numerous times during this day, it’s an incredible thing that’s happening.  A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth, so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes.  And that’s what’s happening.  The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million — so from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week.  In total, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began.  That’s a tremendous thing that’s happened with telehealth.
     As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines.  Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials, with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks.  And you’ve read and seen what’s happened today.  Today’s news was very exciting. 
     Through Operation Warp Speed, we’re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we’re determined to have a vaccine very quickly.  We think we’re going to have something very soon. 
     We have great companies.  These are the — among the greatest companies in the world.  But right now, they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices — prescription drug prices — very massively.  Some of these companies are involved in that; some of them aren’t.  We’re having a tremendous — you’ll see a tremendous drop in price.  We’re using favored nations — we’re using the rebates.  We’re using everything. 
     For so long, I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are.  They call them “the middlemen.”  And they are very wealthy.  Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people. 
     And we’re doing the rebates.  We’re doing purchases from other countries — like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to, under a very bad system.  I don’t call it “archaic”; I call it “bad” because it’s meant, really, for drug companies to get higher prices.
     But under — under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is $2, we’re allowed to say we want favored nations, and we want the pill for the same — the same as the lowest country in the world.  If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that’s the price we’re going to get.  Drug companies aren’t too happy about that — big pharma.
     We’ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness.  Today, the NIH — we’re — very exciting — announced that they’re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country.  We’re going to move — move very quickly.  Results look very good already.  Incredible results. 
     More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway, and we’ve secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir — of remdesivir.  We’re really doing a job with it, and it’s helping a lot of people.  That’s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good — relatively speaking, that is.  But that’s for American hospitals through the month of September.  So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September.  That’s big news.
     The United States also has far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world.  Testing has been incredible, what we’ve been able to do.  Nobody is even close.  Since March 12th, we’ve increased daily testing by 32,000 percent.  How’s that?  Thirty-two thousand percent.  Somebody would say, “That must be a typo.”  It’s not a typo.  Thirty-two thousand percent. 
     We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide, averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week.  And now that we’re understanding the virus, we’re understanding very much what we’re doing with respect to who it affects, who it’s destroying, and who gets away with it — like young people, very young people.  We’ll be having some interesting statements having to do a testing and focus testing.  I call it “focus testing.”
     By comparison, Mexico — so we’re doing numbers that are incredible.  But by comparison, Mexico — as you know, the President was here; he’s a great guy — but their — their numbers are much different.  They do about 1 million tests.  France has done 2.9 million tests.  Canada is around the 4 million mark.  Australia is around the 4 million mark.  The United States is testing more people in a single week than, in many cases, large segments or large, well-known countries all put together.  It’s been an amazing achievement: the testing and the quality of the testing also.  And now we’re doing testing where you can have results in 5 minutes, in 7 minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting to come back from labs — for it to come back from labs.
     Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Phoenix; Miami; Jacksonville, Florida; McAllen, Texas; Bakersfield, California.  And this week, we’re opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas; Atlanta.  To date, more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites. 
     Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual’s blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. 
     FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than — we have new numbers — more than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls, and 21 billion gloves — billion.  Can you believe that?  Billion gloves.
     And we distribute that to the governors, different states.  And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy, that I can tell you.  No — no complaints from any of them.  They’re very, very happy.  What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done.
     In our National Stockpile, we’ve tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million; tripled the number of gowns to 15 million; and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000.  These numbers are growing every day, and we’re now making thousands of ventilators — many thousands of ventilators a month.  And we’re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators.  They’re very hard to produce.  They’re very complicated machines.  So we’re — we’re fully stocked here, and we’ve made sure that every state is fully stocked, but we’re getting them to a lot of countries that need help.
     We’ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine.  I’m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. 
     And I want to thank you all for being here.  We’ll take a few questions.
     Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-4-2020/

1:04 P.M.  EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello.  Sorry to keep you all waiting.  Before I begin, it is day 42 of the botched New York City primary, where still there is no election results in one congressional race.  This, as the New York Times notes, is due to, quote, “the deluge of 400,000 mail-in ballots,” previewing the, quote, “challenges facing the nation as it looks towards conducting the November general election with mass mail-in voting.” 
     Now I’d like to highlight the Trump administration’s actions on telehealth, which the President detailed yesterday.  The President signed an executive order to make regulatory reforms, allowing for greater access to telehealth and toward making it permanent. 
     The Trump administration has cut red tape, allowing telehealth services for seniors and for other Americans.  Thirty-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries took advantage of the President’s reform, seeking telehealth services over the phone rather than through video conference.  A simpler and a smarter way to go about things is now available to Medicare beneficiaries. 
     The President also took executive action to boost rural healthcare services.  According to a 2019 study by Navigant, rural hospitals would be devastated by Medicare for All, otherwise known as government takeover of healthcare.  And under that analysis, they found that if Democrats had their way, 55 percent of rural hospitals or 1,037 hospitals across 46 states would be at high risk of closure. 
     The President’s executive order calls for strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure, which will expand telemedicine and rural broadband access.  Democrats seek to deny Americans their healthcare freedom, but President Trump is working hard to save your healthcare by guaranteeing protections for people with preexisting conditions, eliminating the highly unpopular individual mandate of Obamacare, stopping surprise medical billing, increasing transparency, and lowering drug prices. 
     President Trump will continue to work hard to enact these healthcare principles by requiring price transparency; allowing states to purchase drugs from other countries; and improving Medicare to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for seniors; and by ending surprise medical billing, and making companies compete for your business by providing more options and more affordable plans. 
     Lastly, later today, Advisor to the President, Ivanka — Senior Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump, will be joined by Attorney General Barr; Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Brooke Rollins; executives from organizations that combat human trafficking; and survivors from across the country for a roundtable to highlight newly awarded Department of Justice grants to provide safe, stable housing to survivors of human trafficking.
     DOJ will award over $35 million in Housing Assistance Grants for victims of human trafficking to provide supportive housing and appropriate services to survivors of human trafficking. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-4-2020/

5:36 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias.  It’s a very interesting name.  last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve issued emergency declarations to support a response in both of those areas.  So that’s Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
     This week, the storm passed just east of Florida.  Got a little bit lucky.  Didn’t hit Florida too hard.  Working with the governor, working with everybody.  But it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might.
     It’s currently off the coast of South Carolina, heading northward to North Carolina.  It’s expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a category 1 hurricane.  Very serious.  A lot of water.  A lot of water coming from that storm. 
     I’ve already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina.  And FEMA’S personnel — and they are great; they’re doing a job — they’re already on the ground in all areas.  Every single area that we mentioned is covered.
     Over the next several days, there’s expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey.  We’re working with each of those states, and in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement — all of the different groups that are involved.  Storm surge and inland flooding are possible, and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes.
     I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities.  We’re working with them.  And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far.  So stay safe.
     Next, let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus.  We’re beginning to see evidence of significant progress.  Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6 percent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 to 8 percent over that same period of time, an encouraging sign — very encouraging, I have to add — that the virus is receding.
     In hotspots across the South and West, we’ve seen slow improvements.  From their recent weekly peaks, Arizona’s weekly case counts have dropped 37 percent.  That’s a tremendous drop.  And the governor and the state have done a fantastic job.  Down 37 percent.  Texas down 18.7 percent.  I was there a couple of days ago.  And Florida, 21.2 percent drop.  So that’s a tremendous job that they’re all doing.
     As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare-ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri.  And I think you’ll find that they’re soon going to be very much under control.
     Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates.  Under 5 percent: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  It’s under five.
     Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful, in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those states.
     To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance; wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places; and to protect the elderly.  Very, very important — protect the elderly.  It’s much different.  Young children have very strong immune systems.  We’ve learned how strong they are.  But protect the elderly.  The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old.  That’s the average age.
     It’s important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward, and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent.
     As we’re seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging — you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough, invisible enemy — lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future.  They just don’t.  It comes back.  Many times, it comes back.  The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially as it respects to — with respect to hospitals; learn more about the disease; and develop effective treatments, as we did in the United States.  We’re doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics.
     Countries where there have been very significant flare-ups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan.  And also, as you probably heard, in Hong Kong, they’ve had some very serious flare-ups.  Japan has gone — yeah, a lot — a lot of six-fold — six-fold flare-up.  That’s a lot.  But they’ll get it under control.
     In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school, with careful precautions.  Ideally, we want to open those schools.  We want to open them. 
     At the same time, we’re placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment, and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine.  The vaccines are coming along incredibly well.
     Today I’d like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we’ve done.  We’re taking — really taking an increased interest, and we’re seeing numbers that nobody can even believe, in terms of percentage increase.  It’s telehealth for American patients.  The — the percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it’s very, very significant; numbers that you would not even think possible.
     This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA healthcare team.  And it worked out really well.  We have a 91 percent approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we’re doing.  This is the first — it’s the highest ever recorded.
     Now telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA, and it’s becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens.  You don’t have to go to the doctor’s office; you don’t have to go to hospitals. 
     When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience.  And really, they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes.
     Today I’m taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay.  Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent.  We’ve done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we’re doing on medicine and medical and what we’re doing.  They can do things that you wouldn’t believe, that even a year ago, two years ago would not have been doable.
     We’re enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient.  And very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you.
     The order builds upon a series of actions we’ve all taken to make telehealth available to all.  We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost.  That’s no additional cost.  And co-payments can be waived for telehealth services.
     We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices.  And I will tell you that the favored nations clause that I’ve signed into existence — nobody thought anybody would ever do that — has a massive impact on prescription drug prices, in addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, in particular prescription drugs. 
     But the favored nations clause is massive.  For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 10 cents a pill, as an example — just as an example — and the United States pays 2 dollars for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right as they do.  We never had that before.  We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development.  So the — the numbers are astronomical.  And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by big pharma.  Very big ads.  Very massive buy. 
     But in the meantime, they’re calling.  They want to know if they can make a deal.  And I say to people, “The only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you.”  And they understand that.  I think our people understand that. 
     But, in particular, when you look at the matching — you could call it “matching” or you could call it “favored nations” — call it whatever you like — it’s a tremendous — it’s going to have a tremendous — and I’m talking about 50, 60 percent, 70 percent.  That doesn’t mean it goes to 10 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up and ours goes down.  And you have many, many countries where their numbers — the numbers are so low.  I mean, so low.  And by that, I mean, much lower than the United States.
     Another thing I’m doing is if a certain country, like Canada — Canada buys for very much less than the United States has bought.  How they allowed this to happen — representatives of our country standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office — how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible. 
     We’ve been working on this for a long time.  I’ve been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right?  So now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida — who is doing a great job — or our great governor of Ohio or a great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50 percent less.  So we’ll be buying from Canada.
     Now, what the drug companies are going to do — maybe they’ll raise them, maybe they’ll lower them, or maybe they’ll just give up and sell them to us directly much cheaper.  So a lot of things are happening.
     Also, the rebate — we have people that are very wealthy that nobody ever heard of them.  Nobody knows who they are.  I guess, in some cases, they can be pharmacies; in some cases, they’re individuals.  We’re doing a rebate, and the rebate goes to the people.  It lowers the price of drugs.
     So we have a series of four things that we signed.  And you will see, over a period — a fairly short period — drug prices are going to be tumbling down at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible.
     We have — in 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration.  It was last year.  Fifty-one years it went up.  But that was just a small decline.  This is a massive decline.  This is a decline that nobody can believe.  I was called by senators, I was called by congressmen: “Please don’t do this.”  But big pharma doesn’t mean anything to me other than we want them to do a great job.  We want them to get their vaccines.  We want them to do what has to be done. 
     So I think you’re going to see drug price reductions over the next four or five or six months — it’ll probably take a little while to kick in — that are going to be at numbers that you wouldn’t believe.  But in the meantime — they called on Friday afternoon — they want to meet and see if they do something else.  They don’t like favored nations clauses.  I understand that.
     We vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services — through telehealth, by the way — including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority.  We brought the substance abuse — at least prior to the China plague, or whatever you want to call it — we brought it down very substantially.  Pediatric critical care and much more. 
     Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services.  So a very, very big priority on telehealth.  As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help healthcare providers and hospitals expand their telehealth.  And they’re all doing it.  They’re doing it gladly.
     Prior to the epidemic or the pandemic — whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it — but prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn’t anything raging.  And I guess one of the only good things that we’ve gotten out of this whole horrible situation is telehealth has been incredible.  And again, the increases are, you know, many hundreds of times greater than it was before.  Do you have a number?  It’s like 2,000 percent or something like that.  It’s an incredible — it’s an incredible increase.  You’ll get the number.  But it’s — it’s — I think they have it now finally, and it’s really an incredible — thank you, Kayleigh. 
     We worked with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus.  We cut red tape to allow many services to be conducted by phone, rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. Thirty-five percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone.  So you’re talking about 6-point — 3.6 million seniors.  That’s something.  10.1 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic.  So you’re talking there 10.1 million people.
     In April, over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than 0.1 percent in February.  Those are part of the numbers that I think — I’ll have you get them.  So this part, you don’t have to; you’ll get the other — the other section.  Thank you.
     So think of that: compared to less than 0.1 percent — 0.1 percent.  That’s an incredible number.  So over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to — so you went from 0.1 percent to 43 percent.  That’s an incredible — that’s an incredible number.
     The executive order I signed today will also expand healthcare access in rural America.  We take care of rural America.  It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure.  And we’re working very hard with all of the people in government that are involved with the communications infrastructure so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access. 
     Additionally, revenue for rural providers vary significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business.  Many, many are having a very difficult time.  To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility — really, great flexibility — and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients.
     Furthermore, I’m directing the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission — we were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium — to form a task force that will break down barriers to expanding rural healthcare.  This order continues my administration’s focus on rural healthcare. 
     We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas.  We allocated another $10 billion to 2,000 rural hospitals, and more than 2,400 rural health clinics.  We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time — and these are people that had great reputations and great track records — for practitioners that serve on the frontlines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients.
     We’re also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the state and local areas have the supplies they need.  We’ve been supplying hospitals and cities and states, governors — helping governors at a number that nobody has ever heard of before.  Fifteen thousand four hundred and forty nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment.  They’re very much stocked up; they’re in great shape.  They all have the ventilators — all the ventilators they need.  They have, actually, more than they need.  And their equipment — medical equipment is in very, very good shape.  They’re full.
     My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves, and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide.  We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we’ve been talking about together on vaccines and treatments. 
     Under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting — most exciting — last week, we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients.  Had great results.  This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia.  And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along.
     Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late-stage illness.  They’ve been very good.  We’re also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies, and that, we’re working on.  And that’s a brilliant art.  It’s really an art.  And we launched a national plasma drive last week — I was at the Red Cross building — with the American Red Cross and 13 other healthcare organizations.
     I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov — Coronavirus.gov — and donate plasma today.  We would really appreciate it.  This really makes people better.  But we need — what we need is we need that beautiful ingredient that you, that got better, seem to have in your — in your veins.  You have to go to Coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today.  It’ll be tremendous.  We really appreciate it if you do it, because we’re low.  We’re low.  We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing.  It’ll take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative.  Makes people better.  And, you know, you had something very special.  You had something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to use it.  So whatever you can do.  Coronavirus.gov.
     As a result of improvements we’ve made in treatment, for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85 percent from its April peak.  Eighty-five percent decline. 
     On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine.  One hundred million doses.  This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting.  We’re supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, who are having wonderful results, and they’re in final stages of testing. 
     There are now two vaccines in the — in that final stage of clinical trials in America, with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately.  And we have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies.  These are great companies.  These are companies that are not only well known, they’re well respected, most importantly.
     We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year.  And we’re mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we’re ready immediately upon approval.  We have our military lined up.  It’s logistics; it’s all about logistics.  They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers.  But now they’ll be doing vaccine.  Our general is all ready to go and he’s very excited.  And once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he’ll start the process.  They will start the process, and they’ll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond, if it works as we think it probably will.
     By unleashing America’s technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic and we will hopefully end it very quickly.  The therapeutics are very exciting to me — where you can go into a hospital, and whether it’s through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody and they get better.  That’s something, to me, that’s very important.  And we’re doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines. 
     So thank you all very much for being here.  We’ll take a couple of questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-3-2020/

10:54 A.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: Good morning, everyone. We’re going to begin with some brief remarks from Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and he’ll be giving you all an update on phase four negotiations.
MR. MEADOWS: Good morning. As you know, over the last several days, we’ve been having conversations on Capitol Hill, Secretary Mnuchin and myself, with Democrat and Republican leaders, both in the House and the Senate.
Last night, we concluded a meeting with Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi a little bit before 10 o’clock, and at the President’s direction, we have made no less than four different offers to Democrats on Capitol Hill on how we can make sure that the enhanced unemployment that is set to expire today, along with eviction protection that is set to expire as well, is protected. And those four different offers have been actually rejected, but more importantly than that, they’ve not even been countered with a proposal.
So the Democrats are certainly willing, today, to allow some of the American citizens who are struggling the most under this pandemic to go unprotected. And the President has been very clear for us to be aggressive and forward leaning to make sure that they get protected. And yet, what we’re seeing is politics as usual from Democrats up on Capitol Hill.
It surprises me that when we talk about compassion and caring about those that — that truly are in need, that a temporary solution to make sure that unemployment — enhanced unemployment continues has been rejected not once but multiple times.
The Democrats believe that they have all the cards on their side, and they’re willing to play those cards at the expense of those that are hurting. And we’ll continue on with additional discussions today with Senator Schumer and Senator — and Speaker Pelosi, perhaps an in-person meeting tomorrow on Capitol Hill, as we — we stay engaged.
But I’m — I’m disappointed. And what we’ve — what we’ve experienced over the last three days — and I want to stress that the Democrats have made zero offers over the last three days. Zero. And so, in a spirit of compromise, the President has sent us back not once, not twice, but three different times to try to find some common ground. And what we found from our Democrat negotiators is that they are bumping the price higher than the very bill that they passed out of the House several weeks ago.
And to give you a particular example of that is: In their HEROES bill, they have $100 billion for schools. We matched that offer and actually put forth a proposal for $105 billion for schools for K-through-12 and higher institutions. And yet, what did they say to that? “Oh, no, that was two months ago. We want to increase the amount of money that we send to schools to $400 billion.” We’re going in the wrong direction. They’re going in the wrong direction because of partisan politics. It is very disappointing.
And so we call on Capitol Hill to get serious about their negotiations. The President is serious about the negotiations. We’re willing to engage.
As you know, Leader McConnell, yesterday, put forth a one-week extension at the current level for enhanced unemployment. And what did we see? Senator Schumer objected to that. So there’s no clear message that the American people should receive, other than the fact that the Democrats are willing to pay — play politics at a critical time in our nation’s very dire circumstances as we deal with this pandemic.
So I wanted to give you that brief update so that you can have it straight from the negotiations, as they’ve happened over the last three days, and as we work.
I’m going to — I’m going to turn it over to — to the Press Secretary. And I think she’s prepared to answer all the questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-31-2020/

5:41 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.  Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain.  He was a very special person.  I got to know him very well.  And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus.  And we send our prayers to Herman’s great wife, Gloria.  Wonderful family. 
     And I have to say, America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy.  We mourn their loss, as a nation; we mourn their loss, as people — as people that love one another.  And we’re working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague — it’s what it is, is a plague — but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines.  And we’re making a lot of strides. 
     All over the world, they’re having tremendous problems.  A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well.  Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet — in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong — places where they thought it was — they had really done great.  It came back.  And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly. 
     The virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again.  So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that; you have to hold your statement. 
     Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times — that’s 35 times — in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few.  These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised.  Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections.  And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers — you have no idea what they might be.  And I can say “scarcity of testing.”  Almost anywhere, except for our country. 
     This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border states.  Meanwhile, states like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others — they were thought to be doing well, and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard. 
     And governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore.  They were held up as models to follow, and then they got hit and — now, I’m not even saying this is their fault.  It’s probably not their fault.  It’s just the way it is.  That’s the way it is.  Highly infectious — one of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen.  Not since 1917, over 100 years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we’re witnessing now. 
     But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound.  And, again, no one is immune.  No one is immune.  These facts illustrate the imposing determinant — and it is a determinant — that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country.  People are starting to understand the disease now.  We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn’t have any idea.  We didn’t — nobody ever saw anything like this. 
     The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity, and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality.  And we’ve done that.  But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it. 
     We did the right thing initially.  We saved millions of lives, what we did.  We did the right thing.  But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all.  A small shutdown of certain areas — but we don’t want to do that — small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time. 
     We understand what we’re dealing with now, but it’s a very complex situation.  And I can only say: Thank Heaven that we — that we are so advanced in what we’re doing, in terms of vaccines and therapies. 
     We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets.  Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population.  Think of it: Half of the deaths — really, a tremendous number — half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population, those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  The average age of those who die from the illness is 78. 
     We’ve announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable.  The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions. 
     I’m once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who’s elderly — especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses.  Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we’re discussing.  But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance, wear a mask if you cannot socially distance, and practice vigorous hygiene.
     Everyone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease.  The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected. 
     In the current hotspots across the Sun Belt, the data is showing very encouraging signs.  Arizona, in particular, has crossed an important threshold.  For every person with the virus, we’re now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected.  And the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially.  They’re starting to come down in Florida.  Arizona is really leading the way. 
     I was in Texas yesterday, and they’re starting to come down significantly, we believe, in Texas.  Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they’re coming down very significantly. 
     Earlier today, I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy — which is a tremendous — a tremendous thing that they’re looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it — potentially lifesaving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease. 
     More than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus, and today we’re asking them to visit Coronavirus.gov — Coronavirus.gov — and volunteer to donate plasma.  We need plasma.  It’s something that’s been very effective, and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do.  Most people do. 
     Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating.  We’ve secured over 90 percent of the world’s supply of remdesivir — which is terrific — an encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. 
     We’ve also approved the use of the widely-available steroid — which has been very successful — dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. 
     On July 17th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials — moving along very rapidly.  That’s Regeneron. 
     As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was just in April.  So in a very short period of time.  Think of that: Just 18 — 85 percent lower than it was in April.  It’s a big statement. 
     Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill.  Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers.  We love our American workers.  And we’ve set records on job creation — records — two months in a row. 
     We enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package.  The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs.  We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans.  We approved $500 billion for our hardest-hit industries — $500 billion. 
     We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties.  It was a big thing, a very big thing. 
     We also suspended student loan payments for six months, and we’re looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time. 
     As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record 7 million jobs in the two months past alone. 
     To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will — we had a great foundation to build on.  We were the strongest country in the world; nobody close.  We were outdoing everybody from China.  If you remember, for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States.  Well, it didn’t.  We gained on them very significantly.  We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen — 2019, and we’ll be back there very shortly.  It won’t take very long, based on everything that we’re seeing.  It’s not going to take very long.  I think next year is going to be an excellent year — maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint. 
     We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost, and we never will.  We’ll never forget them; never forget what happened.  This could have been stopped in China.  They should have stopped it, and they didn’t.
     But I’m asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need.  First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits.  This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.  This was not anybody’s fault.  From the standpoint of jobs, it happened — a terrible thing happened.  Could’ve been stopped.  It happened.
     I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today — in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I’m surprised at — because this is great for our country and it’s great for our workers, and it wasn’t our workers’ fault.  
     Second, we’re asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions.  We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments.  We don’t want that to happen.
     Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program.  This money will help millions of hardworking families get by.
     My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen.  Children are not [sic] at the lowest risk.  If you look at what’s going on: the younger, the better.  Amazing — the immune system.  For children, the lower they are in age, the lower the risk, in terms of the age group itself. 
     I tell the story that, in New Jersey, with thousands and thousands of people dying — sadly, dying — the governor was telling me that only one — Phil Murphy — only one died under the age of 18.  That’s incredible.  Where thousands of people that died in the state of New Jersey, one made an impact; one died under the age of 18.
     Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus.  Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our nation’s children.  We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family.  We have to remember that there’s another side to this: Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also.  Economic harm, but it’s causing death for different reasons.  But death — probably more death.
     If governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice.  So we say if a school doesn’t want to open or if a governor doesn’t want to open — maybe for a political reason and maybe not, but there is some of that going on — the money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. 
     If schools stay closed, the money should follow the students so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters — about their children.
     But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party.  They have tremendous voices.  They’re looking at November 3rd.  And probably a day later, they’ll say, “Let’s open up the country.” 
     But the Democrats have to reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it’s going right now.  We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of states that you thought were doing pretty poorly, from the standpoint of the virus, and they’re actually coming back very strong. 
     This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first.  I got elected on the fact that I put America first. 
     For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last.  If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we’ve watched for many years destroy our country — NAFTA, we terminated it.  We have USMCA now, which is a great deal, and our farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic.  But we put America first, America’s families first, and America’s workers first.
     But that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future.  We’ve cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations.  And we’ve cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country.
     Americans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. 
     So I just want to thank you all.  And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. 
     Steve, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-july-30-2020/

5:20 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Today my administration has taken a momentous step toward achieving American pharmaceutical independence — a very, very big, big step — a focus of our campaign to bring America’s critical supply chains and medical manufacturing back to the USA.  We’ve been working on this for a long time.
This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus.  It should have never happened.  It should have never been here.  They should have stopped it.
In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States.  Millions of jobs were vacuumed out — just taken out so easily.  Our politicians let that happen.  And our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases, to China and all over the world — countries all over the world.
Nearly four years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home where they belong.  When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security.  We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America’s medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs.
I just want to say that Pfizer just announced, a little while ago, that they’re combining phase two and phase three trials, and the vaccine looks like it’s really heading in a very rapid direction, in a very positive direction.  First time that’s happened.  And they’re many months ahead of any other trial.  There’s never been anything like it.  So it’s the fastest ever, and to me, it’s very exciting.
Today, I’m proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries.  My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company — you remember this company; it’s called — from the good, old camera age, the old days — to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients.  It’s called Kodak.  And it’s going to be right here in America.
So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak.  They’ve been working very hard.  Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now — Rochester, New York — a good place.  And they’re trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal, and they will be announcing this deal.
I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives.  We’ve worked really well together on this deal.  It’s a big deal.  It’s going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak.
Ninety percent of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs.  We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration, by far.  Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less.
Yet, in less than 10 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs — they’re currently manufactured in America — more than 50 percent, however, are made in India and China.  And you’ll be seeing — a lot of things have happened.  It’s been happening, but it’s happening at a more rapid pace right now.
With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals.  It’s a great name, when you think of it.  Such a great name.  It was one of the great brands in the world.  Then people went digital, and Kodak didn’t follow.  But now, under very extraordinary leadership, they are following and they’re doing something that’s a different field, and it’s a field that they’ve really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company — watching over it.  But it’s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States.
Under this contract, our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act — remember when you were saying I didn’t use it enough, I didn’t use it enough?  And now you heard it’s the 33rd use.  We don’t talk about it all the time; we used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren’t doing as we were asking them to do, and it came through as both a threat and a usage.  But this is our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act.
Kodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal.  Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe.  We’ll be competitive with almost all countries, and soon with all countries.
Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we’ve opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25 percent of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the USA.  That’s a big number: 25 percent.
This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak’s factory in Rochester; that’s just in the initial phase.  And in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well and it’s a great place — and I’m very happy that we’re able to help them with the problems that they’ve had recently.  And the National Guard — I want to thank the National Guard, both state and beyond.  I want to thank them for the incredible job.  They went in and they did some beautiful job.  They cleaned it up.  You didn’t hear about the problems anymore.
And indirectly, I want to create — we created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains.  We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain — not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also.  I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible.
Today’s action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history.  We’ll be able to do that.
Through the Defense Production Act and other authorities, we have invested more than $3 billion in our nation’s industrial base.  We’ve contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year — nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year.
We’ve contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase U.S. production of N95 masks.  And we’ve brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we’ll have 160 million in a very short while — 160 million a month.  That’s many times what we used to do.  If you go back two years ago, it’s many, many times.
We’re increasing domestic production of gloves by 1,000 percent.  It’s 1,000 percent.  We will be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year.
We’re finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric.  We have 13 million reusable gowns in the Stockpile, and we’ll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed.
We made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests.  So we have — there’s nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max.  And we’re already at about a 50 percent level, and we’re bringing it up very substantially from there.
We’re growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month.  There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close.
Through our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing and the state of Maine — a great state — we’ve increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now.  As you remember, I went to Maine; I went to the plant where they do this.  It was incredible.  It was a great experience.  And we’ll produce over 100 million swabs per month by January.
We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter.  So we’ll have 500 million doses.  And, logistically, we’re using our military, our great military — a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations — and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly.  They’re all mobilized.  It’s been fully set up.
A very, very talented general is in charge.  And when we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of.  It’ll be a very — a very rapid process all over the country.  And perhaps we’ll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we, all of a sudden, have become very good at making.
When the China virus struck our nation, we mobilized the entire government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies.  HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns.  That’s a lot of gowns.
Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States.  Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens.  As you know, that’s where we want to take care — we have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem — in particular, heart or diabetes.  Which provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million mask — masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns.
We have replenished the long-neglected National Stockpile.  In January, the Stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks.  Today, the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we’ll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number.
We’ve shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we have more than 75,000 available to deploy.  Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator.  And if you remember, early on when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by, and now we’re the largest maker anywhere in the world, by far.  And not only are we fully supplied and stocked, but we’re helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get.
This is just the beginning.  In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history.  We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world’s premier medical manufacturer and supplier.  That’s what’s happening already.  It’s been happening now for quite some time.
We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots.  You can look at large portions of our country; it’s — it’s corona-free.  But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida.  It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon.  But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it’s starting to head down.
In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on.
And we, as you know, have done a excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse where they wanted to burn it down.  They’re anarchists.  Nothing short of anarchists, agitators.  And we have protected it very powerfully.  And if we didn’t go there, I will tell you, you wouldn’t have a courthouse.  You’d have a — you’d have a billion-dollar burned-out building.
We’re also working aggressively to combat the virus and Native American and Alaska Native communities.  Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in tribal communities, and we’ve worked very hard with tribal communities.  They’re very vulnerable to this horrible plague.  It’s the largest investment in Indian Country in U.S. history.  There’s never been an investment that big in Indian Country.
We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease.  It’s critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk — and, in fact, some are in — some age groups are at an extraordinary low risk themselves — they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk.
I ask all Americans, regardless of background or age, to practice social distancing — which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it; remain vigilant about hygiene; avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars; and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate.
Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before.
We’re looking at a very powerful year next year, economically.  The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly; set records.  The numbers on retail — retail sales — came in two weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country.  So we look like we’re heading to some very, very good economic times; that means jobs, that means stock market.
The stock market is already doing very well.  It’s getting to a point very close to where it was when we had this — when we were hit with the — the plague.  So I just want to thank everybody for being here.
Steve, please.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-july-28-2020/

3:33 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great to be in this wonderful state.  So many friends, so much success, and we love being here.  And we’re here, actually, today to discuss the exciting progress that we’ve achieved under the Operation Warp Speed — our historic initiative to develop, test, manufacture, and deliver a vaccine in record time.  And that’s what it is, in record time.  Likewise, therapeutically, we are very, very advanced.  You’re hearing about it and you’ll be hearing about it a lot more in the next two weeks.  We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing America’s scientific genius, which is what it is.
I’m therefore proud to announce that this morning, the Moderna vaccine has officially entered phase three already.  And that’s phase three clinical trials: the final stage before approval.  There’s never been anything like this, in terms of speed — nothing even close.  A second vaccine is likely to enter phase three in a matter of days.  Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve shaved years off of the time that it takes to develop a vaccine — in some cases, many years — and we’ve done it while maintaining the FDA gold standard for safety.  This is the fastest a vaccine for a novel pathogen has ever gone.  It has never gone like this.  And if you look at where we are, by phase three, we could say “ever gone by far.”
Four additional promising candidates are expected to enter final trials in the coming weeks, including the Novavax vaccine being developed right here at this facility.  It’s an incredible facility.  We’re going to be making a tour in a little while — a very, very complete tour — with the folks that run it and the people that operate.
We’ve just completed a tour of Fujifilm’s innovation laboratories — and that’s going to be done at a much, much higher level in a few minutes after I’m finished, and I believe we’ll take a few questions too — which were carrying out a crucial biomanufacturing process needed to make the Novavax vaccine.  This production is made possible by my administration’s $1.6 billion award to Novavax as part of Operation Warp Speed.  It lets us deliver the final product in a time that never has been achieved anywhere, at any time, for anything like this.
These same manufacturing processes are being conducted on an even larger scale in College Station, Texas.  Today, I’m proud to announce that HHS has just signed a $265 million contract with the Fujifilm-Texas A&M Innovation Center, which is quite the place, to dramatically expand their vaccine manufacturing capacity.  I want to thank Fujifilm CEO Martin Meeson for welcoming us today.  And Martin — where is, Martin?  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Martin.  It’s really wonderful to be with you under these circumstances in particular, with all the progress that’s being made.  As well as Novavax CEO, Stanley Erck.  Stanley, thank you very much.  Thank you very much for being here.
Thanks also to Secretary Alex Azar, who is with us; Senator Thom Tillis, thank you very much.  Thank you, Thom.  Stand up, Thom.  Good job you’ve done.  Thank you very much.  You really have.  Representatives Richard Hudson, David Rouzer, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Greg Murphey, thank you.  All friends.  All warriors.  Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who I hear is doing a great job — where is Dan?  Stand up, Dan.  Great job, Dan.  Really good.  North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore — thank you, Tim.  Great job.  And President pro tem of the North Carolina State Senate, Phil Berger.  Thank you, Phil, very much.  I appreciate it.
Operation Warp Speed is funding a historic portfolio of highly promising vaccine candidates.  In addition to our $1.6 billion investment in Novavax, we’ve issued a $483 million contract with Moderna, a $1.2 billion contract with AstraZeneca, a $465 million contract with Janssen, and just last week, a $1.95 billion agreement with Pfizer.  Tremendous progress is being made with all of those great companies.
A groundbreaking agreement with Pfizer includes a guarantee to deliver 100 million doses shortly after the vaccine’s approval — almost immediately — with the option to purchase an additional 500 million thereafter.  Not only is Operation Warp Speed accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery.  Nothing has happened like this since the end of World War Two.
Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously.  So everything goes at one time.  We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting; it’s all going at one time.  We have a system that has — I think it’s unparalleled.  Never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work, and work very well.
We’re mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that it’s approved, it’ll be available to the American people immediately.  And we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.  The world is suffering from this China virus.
Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus.  Over 140 clinical trials are underway, and a number of effective therapies have already been developed and widely delivered, including remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact — you see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically — dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, and antibody treatments.  We have numerous treatments right now that are under study, and I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that.
On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials.  Late stage.
Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was in April — think of that: 85 percent — and is 25 percent lower than Europe as a whole.
In the middle of April, more than 22 percent of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus.  As the last week, that number has dropped down — as of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7 percent.
To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing — very important.  In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together.  They’re pooled.  Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than — substantially more than 50 percent.
Last week, our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began distributing rapid point-of-care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.
What we’ve already sent includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point-of-care tests.  It’s a tremendous amount.  That’s — you’ll get your response and answer from 5 to 15 minutes.
Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point-of-care tests.  Think of that.  The United States has conducted over 52 million tests.  That’s more than all of Europe put together, times two.  Nobody is even close.  And as countries go, it is — as an example, India is up to 11 million tests.  We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests.  India has 1.4 billion people.
Through our relentless efforts, we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill.  The cupboards were bare.  I say it often.  In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100 million N95 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face shields, and much, much more.  In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month, and we’re distributing them — we have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need.  Other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus.
Last week, FEMA sent additional personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves, and 6 million gowns.  It’s a lot.
Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas, and Arizona held steady and are now heading down.  In Arizona, they’re heading very substantially down, and rapidly.  We’ve been constant — and in constant communication with the states, and are surging them resources when requested.  They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately.  We are totally full, we have everything we need, we get it to the states immediately, we deal with the governors.  The relationship with the governors has been very good.
These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly.  We are working with every governor and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendations.  States are different.
My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections, by far.  Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America, however, the region’s reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted.  And I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world.  We report our cases; most of the world doesn’t.  They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick, or they just don’t report it.
Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly infected countries outside of our borders.
I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott — terrific gentleman — and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas.  We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people.  We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators, and half a million KN90 masks.
Beginning this week, Texas hospitals will receive 500 cases of remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients.
In addition to the cross-border spread, this stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease but can spread the disease.  We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance.
I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars, and wear masks when appropriate.
We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk, which are, in most cases, in many cases, the elderly — especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes.  But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus especially — especially those that are really targeted — almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic, pandemic.
America will develop a vaccine very soon, and we will defeat the virus.  We will have it delivered in record time.  As our visit here demonstrates — and I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina.  This is a great — this is a great place.  It’s a phenomenal place.  And we’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time.
I want to drive the — the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible.  When they call them there, when they call — most of them, many of them are sitting here right now — I will always answer their call.
So thank you very much.  I appreciate you being here with us.  And let’s get on to a few questions.  Tremendous progress has been made, and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before.
So, please.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-covid-19/

597,Trump,2020-07-27 09:24:00+00:00,Remarks by Vice President Pence and Governor DeSantis of Florida in a Press Briefing on COVID-19,Nan,"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine
Miami, Florida
2:24 P.M. EDT
DR. FORD:  Well, good afternoon.  Mr. Vice President, Commissioner Hahn, Governor DeSantis, Governor — Congressman Díaz-Balart, other distinguished guests: It is truly a distinct honor and pleasure to extend a heartfelt welcome to you, to the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.
I’d like to thank each of you for your continued support, partnership, and tireless effort as we navigate the impact of COVID-19 on our community, the university, and our health system.
As I mentioned to the Vice President earlier, he could not have picked a better place to mark the start of the phase three COVID-19 vaccination trials.  The Miller School of Medicine was Florida’s very first medical school and is now home to South Florida’s first and only NCI-designated cancer center.
And the Gordon Center, where we are today, is one of the crown jewels of the university.  It is the home of the first cardiopulmonary simulator for medical education, named Harvey, and that structure has helped train tens of thousands of learners worldwide and continue to do so today.
And as an institution whose overarching mission and singular focus is to be at the forefront of advances in clinical care, medical education, and translational medicine to improve the health of our nation, we are pleased to host you, Mr. Vice President, your first visit to a phase three clinical trial site in the nation.
It is now my pleasure to introduce our governor and a great friend of the University of Miami, Ron DeSantis.
GOVERNOR DESANTIS:  Well, thank you, Dean.  In Florida, we had an interesting situation with our budget.  The budget was completed basically right before the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” was announced.  And so it was done in a financial situation that obviously changed dramatically.  We waited until the end of the fiscal year to consider that budget, but the budget vetoes that I had to issue were historic: a billion dollars.  I likened it to the Red Wedding version of line-item vetoes.
But even though we had to take off so much off the budget, we were able to support the Sylvester Cancer Center here at the University of Miami.  And I think that that’s a testament to, in one of the toughest years, to be able to be there.  It’s a testament to the great work that’s being done here across the board and with these clinical trials.  It’s even been more exciting.
I want to thank the Vice President.  Vice President Pence has been a great friend of the people of Florida.  He was down here, I remember, early on when we met at the terminal with the cruise — the cruise ship executives, and he’s been down multiple times, always willing to lend a helping hand.  And I’ll tell you, it’s been beneficial.
We’re encouraged by the most recent trends.  Yesterday, hospital admissions in the state of Florida for COVID-like illness was the lowest it’s been since June.  Emergency department visits for COVID-like illness yesterday was as low as it’s been since the middle of June.
And Florida’s case fatality rate is about 1.3 percent.  It’s one of the lowest case fatality rates in the country amongst large states.  And part of the reason is some of the great work that our medical professionals are doing here at the University of Miami Health System.  I learned in our roundtable: For admitted hospital patients with COVID, their fatality rate is 10 percent of the admitted hospital patients.  That is incredibly great results with a very difficult disease.  So I really want to thank the folks here who’ve been doing a great job saving lives and generating good patient outcomes.
Part of the reason I think people have also generated better outcomes is some of the therapeutics that have been developed, including this new therapeutic, remdesivir.  This was sent out to states a month or two ago when there was a more demand signal.  As more patients were coming into Miami hospitals, we needed to accelerate those shipments.  I called the Vice President, and I think, like, 48 hours later, it was all arriving at the hospitals across the state.
We’ve had to change the schedule to accelerate to make sure there was no gaps, and the White House has been there every time.  So I want to thank them for what they’ve done to be able to help our physicians have the remdesivir that they need to treat their patients.
And then, finally, I’m really excited that the federal government is sending point-of-care COVID diagnostic tests to nursing homes all across the country.  And as many of you know, we’ve had no visitations in nursing homes since middle of March.  It was the right thing to do.  We’ve done routine daily screening of staffing.  We’re doing bi-weekly testing of staff.  We’ve tested all the residents.  You know, we’ve obviously prohibited hospitals from sending COVID-positive residents back to nursing homes.  It’s been a big focus.  We sent millions of PPE — masks, face shields, all this other stuff.
But we haven’t been able to figure out, okay, when can they be able to see their loved ones.  It’s a tough balance.  But I think with this point-of-care test, you will be able to potentially have the visitation resume, where the family members can be tested, get an answer in 15 minutes, and then you get to go make that human connection.
And all the steps we take, there’s always costs on the other side, and we’ve done a lot to protect our nursing home residents.  I think our fatality rate there is testament to that.  But that has come at an emotional cost; it’s increased loneliness.  And we can’t just do that indefinitely.  This is a way to maintain the safety and still work to keep the virus out of these very vulnerable areas while still giving people some personal nourishment and having the families connect again.
So, Mr. Vice President, thank you for being a part of that.  We look forward to those landing in nursing homes throughout the state of Florida.  We want to thank you again for all you’ve done to help us amongst — along these many difficult months, but I do think that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and a lot of that is due to your support.  So, thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Well, good afternoon.  I want to thank Governor Ron DeSantis and his entire team for the seamless partnership that they’ve forged with our administration since the early days of this pandemic.  We’ve worked together to ensure that Florida had the resources to do testing, that your hospital systems and incredible healthcare workers had PPE, ventilators.  And we’ve also been — we’ve also been working to make those therapeutics, like remdesivir, available in increasing measure.
But today is a historic day, because today, here at the University of Miami, we will begin the first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine in the United States.
Eighty-nine sites all across America, with more than 30,000 participants, will be a part of this phase three clinical trial.  But coming here to the University of Miami, to be able to partner with you, Dean Ford, and the entire team here is a great privilege.
And President Trump wanted me to be here — wanted me to be here, first and foremost, to say to the people of Florida that we are with you.  We’ll stay with you every step of the way.
We’re encouraged by the favorable trends here in Florida, but we’ll continue to make sure your healthcare workers have the resources to provide the level of care that any one of us would want a family member to be able to have: the level of care that’s been being delivered here at the University of Miami hospital system every day during the challenging days through which you have just passed.
But today is a day of hope.  Today is a day of promise.  And today is a day, I think, that — that is a tribute to American ingenuity and to President Trump’s relentless drive toward achieving medicines and a vaccine for the American people.
It’s remarkable to think that the company that will begin phase three today, a company known as Moderna, actually was the first company in America to begin phase one clinical trials back in the month of March.  And as Dr. Stephen Hahn of the FDA may reflect in just a moment, that was in record time.  Literally, it would just be a matter of weeks from when the United States first received the coding for the coronavirus that we were able to initiate an effort to develop a vaccine.  And in 62 days, a period of time never heard of in vaccine development, we were able to go to phase one trial.
But today, here in Florida, we begin the first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine, and we begin it — we begin it in a spirit of the same urgency and the same hopefulness from which it began.
We have moved, at President Trump’s direction, at a historic pace.  But as Dr. Hahn will also reflect, we are going to ensure that we move at a safe and effective pace.  And I want to assure the people of Florida and people all across this country that we will cut no corners in the development of this or any vaccine.
We’re truly grateful for the support of members of Congress in both political parties that have made more than $10 billion available.  I want to thank Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart, who is with us today, as well as the Florida delegation to the House and the Senate for their support.
Because it’s important to note that under Operation Warp Speed, we’re not even waiting to the end of clinical trials to create the vaccines.  Whether it be Moderna or it was announced last week with Pfizer, we’re actually having these companies produce the vaccines as we speak.  And as soon as they are confirmed to be safe and effective, we’ll have tens of millions of doses able to distribute across the country.  It is that initiative, the President launched in Operation Warp Speed that is a reflection of our commitment to bring these medicines, to bring a vaccine to the American people just as soon as we can responsibly do it.
But let me say — let me say thank you again to just a few more folks.  I want to thank Governor Ron DeSantis and his entire team for your leadership during the trying days through which Florida has just passed and throughout this pandemic.  It is a — it is a tribute to Governor DeSantis’s professionalism and to his heart that, from very early on, Florida has leaned into this effort.  And I particularly would commend the Governor’s efforts to look after seniors who we’ve known from the beginning — seniors with serious underlying health conditions — represented the most vulnerable to serious outcomes.  And it was efforts here in Florida that really — really became a model for long-term care around the country.  And we’ll continue, as the Governor said, to support those efforts in the days ahead.
I want to thank the University of Miami not just for being the site of the first phase three clinical trial, but just as much, Dean Ford and your team here, for everything that you’ve done throughout this pandemic and in the difficult weeks through which Florida has just passed.  To have a separate COVID-only hospital to be able to continue to operate your hospital for all the other healthcare needs in the community is a tribute to the innovation and effectiveness of the doctors and nurses and all the healthcare workers in this extraordinary facility.
Finally, I want to say thank you to all of those who’ve agreed to participate in this clinical trial.  It is remarkable to think 30,000 Americans were willing to step forward and to participate in this phase three clinical trial, and they have our thanks.  People who have volunteered to participate in this and other trials are doing more than their fair share to help our nation through this challenging time, and they have our thanks.
For anyone looking on who would like to be a part of either this clinical trial or other clinical trials for therapeutics or for vaccines, you can go to ClinicalTrials.gov and be a part.  That’s ClinicalTrials.gov, and you can get information on how you can participate.
But we all have a role to play.  And we all know that each and every one of us, by practicing good hygiene, washing our hands, wearing a mask every time that state and local authorities indicate it’s appropriate, or wearing a mask when you can’t properly socially distance is how each of us can play a role.  But for those Americans, literally more than 100,000 who have stepped forward and volunteered to participate in clinical trials around the country, you have our thanks as well.
Today, I said, is a great day in America.  The first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine begins here in Florida and in 89 different sites around the country.  And it begins with the best professionalism of our pharmaceutical companies in this country.  American innovation, American creativity begins with the hopes and, I know, the prayers of the American people.
And I’m convinced more than ever on this great day that we’ll get through this.  And we will reach that day, I truly believe, as Dr. Fauci said not long ago, when “if” not — or not “if,” but “when” we will have a vaccine, we’ll have it available to distribute to tens of millions of Americans.  And we’ll reach that day when we finally can begin to put this coronavirus in the past.
So with that, I’m going to turn it over to Dr. Stephen Hahn for his remarks and then — and then, really, one of the — one of the leaders of the clinical effort here at the University of Miami, and we’ll take a few questions.
Dr. Hahn?
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Dean Ford, and Dr. Doblecki-Lewis.  Thank you for hosting us today.  In the early part of this pandemic, President Trump and Vice President Pence asked FDA to make sure that we removed any unnecessary barriers to the development of medical products, and we have followed that request.
Today, we are seeing the initiation of the first phase three clinical trial of a vaccine candidate.  And that is, as to the Vice President said, a historic event in an incredibly short period of time.
I want to thank my colleagues — my medical colleagues who are in the frontline taking care of patients, but also who put together this clinical trial and are helping to enroll patients, and ensuring that it’s done in the absolute highest-quality way.
It is a true sign of America’s great biomedical research enterprise that we find ourselves here today.  Normally, this process would take months and years.  And it’s to the dedication of great medical professionals and researchers that we’ve gotten to this point.
Conducting clinical trials are a crucial piece of our efforts to approve a vaccine for COVID-19.  FDA has oversight over a number of clinical trials for both therapeutics and vaccines — in fact, over 140 — with more than 450 therapeutics in the pipeline.  And I want to thank, like the Vice President did, the Americans who have stepped forward to volunteer for these trials, because they are our true heroes as we evaluate the efficacy and safety of a vaccine.
Now, the important scientific data that we will get from the phrase three clinical trials — and this is, of course, one clinical trial that we’re going to see, but several others are planning to go to phase three in the next several weeks — and the data that come from those clinical trials will allow FDA to do its important work to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective.
And we’re doing everything we can at FDA to support that development by providing regulatory and scientific advice, as well as technical assistance for how to conduct those clinical trials; the number of people that need to be in those clinical trials so that we can have confidence in the data; as well as to make sure that there’s diversity in the clinical trial population, because what we want is to have generalizability of those results to the entire United States population.
As I mentioned, we expect a number of additional trials to go into phase three in the next several weeks to months, and that’s good news for the American people.
As we laid out in our guidance regarding vaccines and in all of our actions to COVID-19, FDA scientists will not cut corners in order to evaluate a medical product, and that includes a vaccine.  And I know that our colleagues performing these clinical trials want to have and must have confidence that we will do that as we evaluate the data that they generate for that vaccine.
It’s these scientists who will call the balls and strikes on approving a vaccine, and they will make their decisions based upon the data and science that’s generated from these clinical trials.  We will authorize or approve a vaccine solely on the basis of the data that we receive in the determination of safety and efficacy.
So I really appreciate the leadership of the University of Miami and other investigators around the country.  Again, it’s the truly great American research enterprise that allows us to get to this point, and Americans can have confidence in FDA that we will make the absolute best decision on their behalf.
Thank you.
DR. DOBLECKI-LEWIS:  Good afternoon.  I’m Susanne Doblecki-Lewis.  I’m the site principal investigator for the University of Miami site for the Coronavirus Prevention Network and for the first phase three clinical trial of that network, which is the Moderna vaccine trial.
We’re incredibly excited to begin this process here at the University of Miami, and we are really amazed and humbled by the number of volunteers who have already stepped forward to be a part of this trial.  And it’s these volunteers, as the others said, who will make the difference and will allow us to know whether we do have an effective and safe vaccine that can move forward.
Here at the University of Miami, we are very aware of the need to shape our enrollment to reflect our strength, which is the diversity of our population here, and particularly the diversity of people who are at high risk for COVID-19.  So we take that mandate very seriously, and we’ll plan to enroll 1,000 patients here; 500 will get the vaccine and 500 will get placebo.
We’ll follow those patients very carefully for two years after the second injection of the vaccine.  The vaccine consists of two injections, phased 28 days apart.  And we’ll be following extremely carefully, checking for any symptoms of potential COVID disease, and performing follow-up swabs and assessments to make sure that we completely understand the efficacy of the vaccine.
So we’re very, very happy to be at this point, and optimistic and looking forward to beginning our enrollment here.
Thank you.

1:36 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  The first duty of government is to protect the safety of our citizens.  That’s what Attorney General Barr said when he was here at the White House just a few days ago.  For 55 days in Portland, Oregon, we’ve seen lawlessness, anarchy, and destruction that threatens peace in our streets and the safety of our fellow American citizens and the safety of our brave law enforcement officers.
Yet some Democrats and some in the media continue to ignore reality.  As Portland’s — Portland’s Democrat Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted, quote, “What I saw last night was powerful in many ways.  I listened, heard, and stood with [the] protesters. And I saw what it means when the federal government unleashes paramilitary forces against its own people.”  That was a quote from the Democrat mayor who quite literally stood in the middle of a riot as violent protestors attacked a federal building.  That is appalling, and Mayor Wheeler is clearly failing at his duty to protect his streets and his city there in Portland.
The federal government has a sworn duty to uphold the laws of the United States through field offices and federal facilities across the country.  These agents protect and serve the American people.  Yet the rhetoric of the left undermines our justice system, with Nancy Pelosi calling them “stormtroopers,” Jim Clyburn calling them the “Gestapo,” and Wheeler using the term “paramilitary forces.”
Under President Trump, violent crime rates in America finally began to fall.  Rhetoric like this cannot be allowed to set us back.  Augmenting the Federal Protective Service, guarding federal property in Portland, our brave officers have — since — since augmenting them, I should say, our brave officers have faced all of these various things — like rioters barricading officers inside the Hatfield federal courthouse, trapping officers inside.  A, quote, “commercial-grade mortar firework” was launched by rioters.  A federal agents hand was impaled by planted nails.  Another federal agent was shot with a pellet gun, leaving a wound deep to the bone.  And tragically, three federal officers were likely left permanently blinded by the rioters using lasers pointed directly at their eyes.
These are not the actions of so-called peaceful protesters, and the Trump administration will not stand by and allow anarchy in our streets.  Law and order will prevail.
And I have a short video for you because I want it to be real what is happening right now in Portland.  So if we could play that video, that’d be great.
(A video clip is played.)
As you can see, that is anything but a peaceful protest.  And this President will always stand on the side of law and order.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-072420/

5:25 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
We’ve had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus.  I have reminded people of the importance of masks when you can’t socially distance, in particular.  A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places.
Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents.  We’re working very hard on that.  We’re doing very well all over the country.  And also about contracting with Pfizer — we made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer.  We think they’re very close — but we have a lot of companies that are very close — to produce a vaccine.
And I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you: This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida.  It’s a place I love.  I love that state.  The drawings look absolutely beautiful.  I never thought we could have something look so good, so fast with everything going on.  And everything was going well — a tremendous list of speakers; thousands of people wanting to be there — and I mean, in some cases, desperately be there.  They wanted to attend.  People making travel arrangements all over the country; they wanted to be there.  The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line.
But I looked at my team, and I said, “The timing for this event is not right.  It’s just not right with what’s happened recently — the flare up in Florida — to have a big convention.  It’s not the right time.”
It’s really something that, for me — I have to protect the American people.  That’s what I’ve always done.  That’s what I always will do.  That’s what I’m about.
They said, “Sir, we can make this work very easily.  We have great enthusiasm.  Incredible enthusiasm.  Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they’ve seen.  We can do this safely, and we can do it responsibly.”
And I said, “There’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that’s from the China virus or the radical-left mob that you see in Portland” — where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days.  They went in, and people were out of control for 51 days — a long time.  And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in, and they’ve done a great job protecting our property — the federal courthouse and other property — and, most importantly, protecting our people.  Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit — a lot of other cities where so many people are shot, and so many people are killed.  And people elected me to help and to protect.
So, I told my team, “It’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention.”  We’ll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday, as has always been planned.  We were never taking that off.  That’s remaining as it is.  The delegates are going to get together.  That’s where they do their nomination.  So, the delegates are going to North Carolina, and they’ll be doing the nomination.  And we’re going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online — the week that we’re discussing, which will be really good.  I think we’re going to do it well.  And I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won’t do a big, crowded convention per se.  It’s just not the right time for that.
I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country — and even in the world — who would be coming into the state, and I don’t want to do anything to upset it.  They’ll be doing very well very shortly.  We’re going to put some maps up of the country behind me, and you’ll see that the area that we’re talking about is a hotspot.  You will also see a lot of the country is — has no problem whatsoever — most of the country, actually.  So I’m always going to take care of you, so that that’s the way we’re going to do it.
I’ve spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders.  I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and its great mayor.  He’s a great — great guy.  Really great guy.  They wanted it so badly.  And all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida.  And just very special people — a very special group.  And they were there for us, 100 percent.
Today, I want to provide an update on the actions we’re taking to support the safe reopening of America’s schools.  Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they’re essential to our children’s future.  Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high-risk factors can continue to participate from home.  Very important.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.  It said, quote:
    “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in [a] social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical [and] sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation.  This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.  Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been [a] substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and [for] families.”
So, that’s very important, and there’s a highway — it goes both ways.
The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.”  Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important.
One study estimates that, due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35 percent behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50 percent behind in math.  That’s a big statement.
According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income black and Hispanic students.  They’re the ones that are hit the hardest.  We don’t want that happening.
Thirty million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals.  Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools.  According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly, having to do with child abuse, they have neglect — and these are neglect and neglected cases are submitted by education personnel.  So people in the education world, on the premises, will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children.  They know if they’ve been neglected.  They know if they’ve been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it’s at home or someplace else.  But they see this at school.  You don’t get to see that if you’re not going to school.  It’s a big thing.
Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus, very substantially.  When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare.  Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions.  Ninety-nine percent of all China virus hospitalizations are adults.  And 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults.  That means that children are a tiny percentage — less than 1 percent, and even a small percentage of 1 percent.
In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to the coronavirus.  Many different names.  Many, many different names.
The life of every child is sacred and must be protected.  Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America’s children.
I have a very, very special person who loves children, who is — who is, I think, one of the greatest athletes of all time.  A lot of people say “the greatest pitcher of all time.”  Known as a “relief pitcher” who could have been whatever he wanted.  Some people — he is the greatest reliever of all time, by far.  Substantially more saves than anybody else.  In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently.
And he — I’m reading off these stats.  I knew he was the best.  I knew he was great, but I didn’t know it was almost double anybody else.  But he’s a man who loves children — has children, loves children, works hard with children.  We’re going to go outside and be with some little leaguers.  Mariano Rivera — you know, he’s the “Sandman,” right?  My wife said, “Darling, why do they call him the ‘Sandman’?”  I said, “You know, they play the song.  He just puts the batters to sleep.”  And that’s exactly what happened.
So, having Mariano here is a great honor.  Thank you very much.  He was talking about children in schools.  And there’s nobody that’s done more than you have.  Thank you very much, Mariano.  Fantastic man.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and to protect students.  And we do have to protect the teachers and the families also; we have to remember that.
All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance.  This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at high risk.
In cities or states that are current hotspots — and you’ll see that in the map behind me — districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks, and that’s possible.  That’ll be up to governors.  The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community, but every district should be actively making preparations to open.
Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours.  They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem.  So, it’s pretty amazing actually.  Great, great credit.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide.  As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk — much lower, in the case of young children — to resume work and school and — as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing.  We want that.
A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms.  We don’t want to do that.
At the same time, we have to get our economy going.  We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday.  Housing prices — pricing of housing up 21 percent.  It’s the highest in history.  It’s the highest number in history.  Real estate housing went up 21 percent.
Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely.  I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions.  This isn’t about politics; it’s about something very, very important.  This is not about politics.  I even think it’s bad politics if you do the wrong decision.  Very bad politics.
We’re asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill.  This funding will support mitigation measures, such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aides, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing, and crucially, mask-wearing.  This money is in addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year.  That money we have; some is distributed, and some is not distributed.
If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.  The key word being “choice.”  If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions.  So we’d like the money to go to the parents of the student.  This way, they can make the decision that’s best for them.
We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school — harming their mental, physical, and emotional development.  Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families.
The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year.  That’s a tremendous problem.  It’s a tremendous problem.  Schools have to open safely, but they have to open.
More than a dozen European countries — as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others — have already reopened schools, and cases have not risen.  We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.
We’ll continue to support states and cities in the current hotspots in the South, Southwest, and West.  The governors — I know them all.  They’re all very, very capable.  They’re doing a very good job.  They’re working so hard.  You wouldn’t even believe it.
We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance.  We’re helping with doctors and nurses — medical personnel of all kinds.  As a PPE update, we’re in close communication with governors and states.
We have supplies — everything they could possibly need.  We’re very strong on supplies.  Remember I used to say the cupboards were bare?  Well, now the cupboards are the opposite.
Due to our historic efforts to increase both the National Stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days’ worth of supplies on hand.  And most importantly, they have ventilators — because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past.  Now we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them, in many cases, to other countries.
For states that are making requests, we’re rapidly delivering.  In the last 24 hours, FEMA has deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000 — well, let me change that.  We’ve created about 600,000 different supplies.  We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington.  I think the number is 600.  We’ll go check that, and we’ll give it you in a little while.  But we’ve — we’ve got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators.  I think we’ve sent out about 600 just recently.
The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world, by far.  Roughly half of the tests are either the rapid, point-of- care tests, which, frankly, solves a lot of problem in delay — 5 to 15 minutes, instead of waiting for service both ways, in both directions, and then at the lab.  But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are 5- to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day — in some cases, immediately.
We’re continuing to surge testing to current ho- — hotspots, such as Miami and Phoenix, to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further.
This is a copy of the map, and this is a — you have it right behind me.  That’s really very much indicating where the problems are.  You see from — from that, it’s in great shape — lots of it.  The Northeast has become very clean.  The country is in very good shape, other than if you look South and West — some problems.  That will all work out.
On therapies: We’ve worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of remdesivir are arriving this week.  That’s a lot.  That’s a really — that’s a lot.  They’re working around the clock to make it.  It’s had a tremendous impact.  We’ve also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks.  Arizona is doing very well; it’s heading down.  The numbers are heading down, I think, very quickly.  The governor has done a great job.  They’ve all done a great job.  They’ve all done a great job.  Working hard.
We’ll continue to monitor the areas rising and — with respect to cases.  And we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation — this horrible disease that was sent to us by China.
It should not have been sent.  They should have stopped it.  They could have stopped it.  They didn’t.  And the entire world has gotten infected, and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now.
This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they’re going through a very hard time with this — in Moscow, in particular.  I spoke to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.  They’re doing well, but they’re going through a lot.  Everybody is going through a lot.
Yesterday, I spoke to the heads of four different countries.  All four are going through a lot.  They’re going through a hard time.
This could have been stopped.  It could have been stopped quickly and easily.  But for some reason, it wasn’t, and we’ll figure out what that reason was.
So, with that, if you have any questions — please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072320/

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room


5:50 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today, my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval.  Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly.  And we think we have a winner there.  We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well on the vaccines — long ahead of schedule.
As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter.  This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time — really a very small fraction of the time, based on previous schedules.  I want to thank the FDA.  I want to thank everybody involved.  It’s been an incredible process.
As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens, as we all know.  The median age for those who die from the virus is 78 years old, and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.  That’s really something.
In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1 percent of the U.S. population.  So think of that: less than 1 percent, half of the fatalities.  So we know what to look for.
From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors.  In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities.  And we gave it a very strong priority.  FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it’s going directly to 15,400 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified nursing homes throughout the country.
Today, I’d like to provide an update on the additional actions we’ve been able to take, and they’ve been very constructive.  First, we’re requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in states where you had the worst outbreaks.  All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We’re distributing 15,000 rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices to support this effort.  These are the tests where it takes five minutes to fifteen minutes.  They’re very accurate. They’re very good.  And we’re sending them all over the country.  And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities.
Second, HHS will be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes.  Nursing homes in higher-risk areas will be receiving more funding.  This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing, and providing technology support so residents can connect their families and they can connect to their families.  They are having a tremendous time.  They want to be with their loved ones.  They can’t do it, so what we’re doing is we’re working it so that we can connect — have them connect with their families if they’re not able to visit.
Third, we’ve been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the governors, so that the governors and their staffs can take appropriate action.  We’re able to find — because of the testing programs and other means, we’re able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The governors can then take action.
Additionally, CMS, CDC, and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest-risk nursing homes.  And that’s their priority right now: nursing homes, but the highest-risk nursing homes.
CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most.  And we have them surveyed, and we have them mostly pinpointed.
Over the past few months, we’ve created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks.  And currently, 99 percent of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it, so we have great data.  When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert the state and make sure that it responds very quickly.  We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly.
I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life.  We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope.  The light is starting to shine.  We will get there very quickly.  But we send our love; we send a message of love — very important.  We’re with you all the way.
As far as the outbreak in the Sun Belt, I said yesterday: We continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the South and Southwest and the West.  We’re closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida.  Arizona is starting to come down.  Done a very good job.  They’re all doing a good job.  They’re very talented people.
There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections.  Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations — which you know very well about — which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide.  And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places — maybe beaches — four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide — likely also contributed.
We’re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately.  I was with the President, and it’s a big problem for Mexico.  But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Two hundred and fifty-seven miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great, positive impact on people coming in.  And we have record-low numbers of people coming in illegally; that’s helped greatly.  It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we’re doing right now and for the pandemic.
Nationwide, beyond the outbreak in several states, cases remain low and very stable.  Nineteen states have positive test rates of less than 5 percent.  Eight states have positive test rates of less than 2 percent.  Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8 percent, compared to over 16 percent at its peak in April.  It’s coming down.  It’s coming down fairly rapidly.
Today, we surpassed — first time — we surpassed 50 million tests.  That’s far more than any country in the world.  India is second, we believe.  We think — 1.4 billion people; that’s about 12 million tests.  We have 50 million tests.
We’re working with every state to ensure the supply of remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill.  We’re working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes — everybody.  The remdesivir has proven to be terrific.  Our case fatality rate continues to decline, and we want to push this rate even lower.
The therapeutic research continues daily on new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use of blood thinners and steroids.  A lot of different things are happening, and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn’t have known a number of months ago.  We’re doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines.
And, frankly, therapeutically — or maybe a word even beyond that word is “cure” — would be the best of all, and we’ll see what happens.  But that would be great if we could go into the hospital, and just cure people.  And we’re at a position we’re actually able to — to a certain extent, with what we have right now.  And we think, in a very short period of time, we’ll be able to do that.
Our strategy is to shelter the highest-risk Americans, while allowing younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant.  Wear a mask, socially distance, and repeatedly wash your hands.  Practice very, very good sanitary means.  You have to do this.  You have to just — you have to look at it differently.  Wash your hands often.  I’m finding more and more people are saying, “Wash your hands.”  So wash your hands.  We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.
And we’re all in this together.  And as Americans, we’re going to get this complete.  We’re going to do it properly.  We’ve been doing it properly.  Sections of the country come up that we didn’t anticipate — for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera — but we’re working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it’s all going to work out, and it is working out.
So, with that, I’ll take a few questions, please.  Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072220/

626,Trump,2020-07-21 08:37:00+00:00,Remarks by Vice President Pence and Governor McMaster of South Carolina in Press Briefing,Nan,"Pastides Alumni Center
University of South Carolina
Columbia, South Carolina
1:37 P.M. EDT
GOVERNOR MCMASTER:  I’d like to welcome everyone here to the University of South Carolina.  This is where we’ve had many of our meetings concerning the pandemic.  And we’ve gotten a lot of great ideas in this place, and we got some more today.  We appreciate very much the effort of the Vice President, Secretary, the Administrator, and coming here and being with us, as well as Superintendent.
And we look forward very much to your questions.
Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Well, thank you, Governor McMaster.  I want to thank you and First Lady Peggy for the hospitality today.  Karen and I are honored to be here with you, grateful for your strong and steadfast leadership throughout this pandemic.  And as we see cases rising across South Carolina, on behalf of the President and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, Governor McMaster, I want to thank you for the seamless partnership that we have forged on behalf of the health and wellbeing of the people of South Carolina.
But with rising cases here in the state, the President wanted me to be here today with a very simple message for the people of South Carolina, and that is: We are with you.  And we’re going to work closely with your governor and with all your state health officials to make sure that the people of this state have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and the therapeutics, and the supplies to meet this moment.
And, Governor, I — again, I want to — I want to thank you for organizing the discussions that we had today.  I mean, having the opportunity to meet with your health team, to hear your perspective on what’s happening on the ground in South Carolina, and the great efforts that healthcare workers are making all across this state and the great cooperation of the people of South Carolina, I know that we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together.
President Trump will be briefing the nation later today on our administration’s efforts, working with states, particularly across the Sun Belt, with the — in midst of rising cases.  But let me just say a few words about our response.
As, Governor, you know with — the rise in cases across the Sun Belt is serious, but the people of South Carolina should know that we are in a much better place to respond to this pandemic across the south than we were two and three months ago.
But because of the partnership we’ve forged with your governor, with governors around the country; because of the whole-of-America response that President Trump initiated that has taken testing to nearly 50 million tests having been performed across the country; the development of hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment; over 100,000 ventilators being constructed in 100 days; and the rapid development of therapeutics, whether it be remdesivir or convalescent plasma, or others that are under active consideration at the FDA — that, combined with the Operation Warp Speed’s development of vaccines, we are leaning into this effort and we are — we are in a much better place to make sure that your governor and your healthcare providers in this state have the support and resources, but to provide any member of your family with the level of healthcare that we would want for a member of our family.
We’re proud of what South Carolina has accomplished.  Governor, I think, in March, you were performing roughly 540 tests per day; now nearly 10,000 tests a day.  And — and I also want to commend you, Governor, for the efforts you’ve made protecting the most vulnerable.
From very early on, we’ve recognized that seniors with serious underlying health conditions represent those most vulnerable to the coronavirus.  And to that end, Seema Verma, in a few moments, will detail a plan that we unveiled last week building on our efforts to focus resources and measures and standards on nursing homes.  We announced last week that the federal government will be distributing point-of-care tests — 15-minute tests — to all 15,400 nursing homes in America, beginning at the end of this week.  And Seema Verma, with the Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services, will describe that.
With regard to supplies: I’m informed, Governor, that as of July 9th, FEMA and HHS have delivered to South Carolina
nearly a half a million surgical masks, not including nearly 400,000 N95 respirators, tens of thousands of face shields and coveralls.  And we’ve also made certain that you will continue to have the ventilators here in South Carolina that are — that are needed for people facing the most serious consequences.
Seema Verma will also talk for a moment about healthcare capacity.  We are monitoring healthcare capacity across the Sun Belt.  And while there are instances where some hospitals in states that are being impacted by rising cases, there are instances where individual hospitals are beginning to reach capacity.
The report that we received today here in South Carolina and all across the Sun Belt is that overall hospital capacity remains strong, hospital beds are available.  But we launched a new website this week to make sure that hospitals are giving us real-time information so that we can continue to work with states to make sure that that remains the case and that hospitals have the supply that they need.
But beyond all of that — and we’re focused on saving lives, protecting our most vulnerable, but as we discussed today, we’re also focused on reopening America: opening up America again and opening up America’s schools.  And, Governor, I want to — I want to commend you for your steady efforts to put the people of South Carolina back to work.  I’m informed that more than 105,000 South Carolinians have joined or rejoined the workforce in the month of June, and your unemployment rate in this state has dropped from over 12 percent to just under 9 percent.
I think the American people and people across this state realize that when it comes to a choice between dealing with the pandemic or opening up America, it’s not an either/or; we can do both.  We all have a role to play.  All of us need to do our part to practice personal hygiene, wash our hands, wear a mask wherever state or local authorities determine it’s indicated or where the social distancing is not possible.
But, Governor, you’re proving here in South Carolina that you can put this economy back to work.  And you’ve already unveiled a plan to reopen schools across South Carolina, and that was much of what our discussion was today.
And on behalf of the President and our entire task force, I want to thank you.  I want to thank you for leading the way on getting our kids back in the classroom.  We heard today from education leaders from across this state, and I was — I was deeply inspired by the words that I heard.
In just a few moments, I’ll yield the podium to the Superintendent of Anderson School District Five.  Superintendent Tom Wilson today reflected very memorably on the academic impact on children, especially children who are struggling learning how to read.  The reality is that the — that without getting our kids back into school this fall, children that are struggling academically, children that are struggling with learning how to read will fall farther and farther behind with long-term consequences on their academic future and needs.
Also, I was deeply moved today to hear from Janie Neeley, the mother of a special needs 4-year-old by the name of Marsh.  Marsh has Down’s syndrome.  And Janie spoke very eloquently about — about the fact that Marsh misses his friends.  He misses his teachers.  He misses the counseling that he receives as special needs students do uniquely in schools around this country.
And so, Governor McMaster, we commend you for your efforts to get our kids back into school.  And we commend President Caslen’s efforts to reopen the University of South Carolina.  We understand we don’t want our kids to fall behind academically, as Superintendent Wilson reflected, but also, it’s so important to recognize — whether it’s special needs, whether it’s nutrition needs, whether it’s counseling for emotional needs — millions and millions of children across this country rely on services that are only available at their schools.
And so for the sake of their academic wellbeing, for the sake of their personal wellbeing, Governor, you recognized today, as your team did, that it’s vitally important that we reopen our schools.
It’s also: To reopen the American economy, we got to reopen our schools.  It’s — the reality is that for working parents, working moms and dads, there is a great hardship in children not returning to school.  I heard a statistic on the way here that that less than 25 percent of single parents are able to telework, which puts a great, great burden on their ability to both be a parent and also provide for their family.
In hearing all that good counsel today, I just reiterated to the governor that we’re going to continue to provide the resources and the guidance so that states like South Carolina can safely reopen schools, as you reopen your economy and deal with rising cases across this state.
I’m pleased to report, with a grateful nod to your congressional delegation, especially Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, that we’ve already secured more than $30 billion in funding for states: $13 billion for elementary and secondary education, and more than $14 for higher education.  And I know, Governor, you just made an announcement about the distribution of those resources to school systems and universities here in South Carolina.
I’ll also pledge to you that our team is on Capitol Hill today negotiating and discussing a phase four of our recovery and relief legislation.  And the President made it clear to our negotiators yesterday that we want education funding to be a centerpiece of any additional recovery efforts by the Congress of the United States.  And so more help is on the way, Governor, and we’re going to continue to support your efforts and efforts across this country to get our kids back to school.
And finally, we’ll continue to give additional guidance. From early March, the Centers for Disease Control has issued consistent guidance for schools, providing additional tools for operating schools safely.
And in the days ahead, the CDC will be issuing additional decision-making tools for parents and guardians, preparing K-12 school administrators for a safe return in the fall, and limitations and considerations on symptom screening and the like.  That guidance will be forthcoming in the days ahead, and we look forward to providing that to you, as well as to all the great education leaders all across this state.
Finally, let me just say to the people of South Carolina what I said in the beginning — is that on behalf of the President of the United States and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force: We’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you every step of the way until we put this coronavirus in the past.  We’re going to continue to partner — partner with the — with your governor and with all your health officials and your hospitals to make sure our healthcare workers have the support and the supplies that they need to render healthcare to anyone impacted by the coronavirus.  And we’re going to continue to work — continue to work in ways that can open up the state’s economy again and get our kids back into school.
But we all do have a role to play.  We can slow the spread. We can flatten the curve.  We can save lives.  What we saw when this pandemic first struck our country was that with the full cooperation of the American people, with the full support of our healthcare workers, we can accomplish those things.  We did it in the Greater New York City area; we did it in New Orleans and Michigan, and other places.  We have every confidence that with the full cooperation the American people, the dedication of our healthcare workers, with the strong leadership of administrations like yours, Governor McMaster, that we will do it again in the Sun Belt.
But I do want to encourage each one of your citizens, as I said before, to heed local guidance when it comes to wearing a mask or where — or just wear a mask when social distancing is not possible.  Wash your hands.  Practice — practice personal hygiene.  Each one of us has a role to play, and we’ll get through this, I know, by putting the health of our neighbors first, looking after the future of our economy, looking after the future of our kids, getting our schools back open again.  And we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this together.
With that, I’m going to recognize the Secretary of Education for a report, and the Director of the — of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
But before that, I ask the Superintendent, Tom Wilson, of Anderson School District 5 to share a few of his thoughts on just how important it is that schools in South Carolina reopen, and maybe to reflect for a few moments on the plan that they’ve announced to get kids back in the classroom in school district 5 starting on September the eighth.
Superintendent.
SUPERINTENDENT WILSON:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Governor McMaster.  I shared with the panel a few moments ago our plans to reopen schools in Anderson School District 5.  We will open September the 8th.  We will give parents a choice of face-to-face or a virtual academy that’s being developed, where they can — we’ve been surveying our parents.  We believe we’ll have about 20 percent of our parents choose to do that, but it is a choice of the parents.  At the semester break in January, they’ll have the possibility come back to face-to-face, if they so desire, and hopefully the spread will be somewhat flattened at that point.
I think what resonated with the group a few moments ago was what I want to share with you: As of March the 16th, all the schools in this state were closed.  And Anderson School District 5, we were way ahead of everybody because we had developed it. We were the first school district in the state to have e-learning.  We piloted e-learning.  And other districts followed us, and we mentored other districts.
And we invested millions and millions of dollars in technology, Chromebooks — from kindergarten to 12th grade — digital integration specialists, fix-it people to keep things up and running.
E-learning — and you might hear the word “remote learning,” “e-learning,” different terms — it was never intended for 25 percent of the school year for kids to be out of school.  It was intended, in this state, for three or four days, when we had to call school off for snow.  But we were the best of a bad lot because we were the best at e-learning, and, still, it was very successful for a lot of students, but it was not successful for a lot of students, primarily the poor, the low income, single parents.
And the difficulty we had is when mom or dad has to be at Electrolux making refrigerators at 7:00 a.m. — they cannot telework.  Teleworking is really, quite honestly, a professional opportunity for professional staff.  They can’t.  They have to work.  They work with their hands.  They build things.
And as a result, we had a lot of kids who had very little support.  Our research tells us that if a child has a ineffective teacher for two years in a row, the chances of them graduating from high school is basically slim to none.  If they have no teacher for two years in a row, I assure you they will not graduate.  And what keeps me up at night are those kids that left us on March the 16th that were kindergarteners, first graders, second graders, third graders, fourth, and maybe even fifth graders, that were struggling readers.
And I dare say there may be a few people in this room that could teach somebody how to read.  I can’t.  I’ve been doing — I’ve been in public schools for 44 years; been a principal teacher, superintendent.  I ca- — I don’t know how to teach your child to read.  That’s not my — I wasn’t trained.  Teaching reading is a science and it’s also an art, and it has to be done at the shoulder of a child, for most children.
And so what I worry about are those struggling readers.  If we don’t get them back face to face with a teacher, six, seven years from now, eight years from now, we’re going to see a dropout rate like we’ve never seen, because kids drop out of school because they find it irrelevant and boring.  And when they get on up in where they can drop out, then they’ll quit and they won’t graduate.  And all of us in this room and all of us in this state and all of us in this country are going to pay the burden and pay the price for that, because what will happen: We’ll continue to put more people on the train and less people pulling it.  And those of us that are pulling, and everybody in this room, it will cost us more because they will never be able to get it.
Those of you who have little children: We can teach a 5-year-old Spanish like that, but try to teach it to a 40-year- old or a 25-year-old; it’s very difficult.
So, reading is essential.  That’s crucial.  I worry about the elementary a lot more than a high school.  I told our teachers, our principals: The tip of the spear is our elementary teachers because that’s where — that — that’s where the battle will be won.  And we look forward to doing that.
I commend the Governor for his support of opening schools, and we’re going to do it.  And we look forward to getting back.  We look forward to working with our virtual academy.  And it’s been an honor to be with you today, Governor, Vice President.  And thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great words, Tom.  Thank you.
Betsy.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President.  It’s really a privilege to be here with you in South Carolina today.  Governor McMaster, thank you so much for hosting us and for your leadership here in the Palmetto State.  And, Superintendent Wilson, thank you for so clearly articulating how imperative it is that kids be able to get back to school this fall.
I really resonated also, in the previous session, with what Dr. Caslen said.  And he said, “As South Carolina’s flagship university, I believe that we bear the responsibility to open our doors to students, most of whom are eager to resume their education in person and on campus.”  We must get schools back open, and we know we can do it safely.  The science on this is clear, and it’s only growing stronger.  It’s critical to students’ health and wellbeing.  It isn’t a question of health versus safety; it’s a question of health versus health.  Students need access to the services they receive at school.  They need to be with their teachers and their friends and they need to be learning and growing.  Thanks to the President’s leadership, we’ve made sure the needed resources are there to make it happen safely.
South Carolina’s K-12 schools have already received $126 million under the CARES Act.  But we know — also know that for too many students, especially the most disadvantaged, they might — may not have the right option for them and their families right now, or their assigned school may just be refusing to open.
And I think of what mom Janie Neeley said in the previous session about the need for her son, Marsh, to have that in-person experience with teachers and with students.  And I think also about Principal Akis [sic] Ross — Akil Ross, who talked about the imperative to be focusing on what students need and doing the right thing for students.
I want to applaud again Governor McMaster for the leadership he’s shown in supporting all students.  These Safe Access to Flexible Education, or SAFE, grants he announced yesterday will ensure that a student’s personal and family circumstances don’t limit them from accessing the best education possible.  This is a model, frankly, that the nation should follow.  It’s the President’s vision for every American student and why he’s fighting to pass school choice now.
We know that Congress is looking at how to best provide more relief, and this administration is going to fight for every student to go back to school safely and at a school that will best meet their unique needs.
When the assigned schools fail to rise to the challenge, we believe students and parents deserve a choice to go somewhere else, and the tax dollars meant to support their students’ education should go with them, not to a system.
So with that, again, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your leadership, and I look forward to continuing to work to ensure all students can get back to their learning safely and promptly.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thanks.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  And thank you, Governor, for hosting us today.  It’s a pleasure to be here, and appreciate all of your strong efforts on opening schools.
You know, one of the things with the Medicaid program that I run is that we provide a lot of healthcare services inside the schools.  Kids get vision services, they get screenings, immunizations.  And so it’s not only part of their learning; these healthcare services are important to their health, but also for their ability to learn.  So, really appreciate your efforts to open the schools.
When the pandemic started, the President and the Vice President were very clear on our mission: protecting the vulnerable and making sure that healthcare workers on the frontlines had what they needed to fight this battle.
And so let me start with nursing homes.  That’s our — one of our most vulnerable populations.  We know that nursing homes have been hit hard, but also, for the residents, it’s been an extraordinarily difficult time.  They’ve been separated from their families, haven’t had a chance to visit, and then many times, they’re restricted inside the room.  So it’s been a very difficult time, but we appreciate all of the strong leadership, especially at the state level.
We asked states at the very beginning to do inspections across the board of their nursing homes.  Almost 97 percent of those have been completed in South Carolina.  And the President has also wanted to make sure that nursing homes have the tools that they needed.  FEMA has been sending supplies directly to nursing homes.  We’ve also made grants available to nursing homes so that they can buy iPads and computers so that their residents can communicate with their loved ones.
And more recently, as we’re opening up, we want to make sure that nursing homes have the continued focused on testing.  We’ve asked that they test their resident — at least do a one-time pass.  And also, for their healthcare workers, that they do that testing on a weekly basis.
And we announced last week that we’re going to be providing point-of-care tests inside the nursing home to every nursing home across the country — that’s over 15,400 nursing homes — and that’s going to allow them to do rapid testing, get those results back in 15 minutes.  They can identify staff that have been impacted and also make sure that residents that are — that are sick and those — and separate the ones that are sick from those that are not.  And so that’s going to be a critical effort.
It also relieves the testing as some of the — it relieves the system, in terms of the testing capacity.  If nursing homes can do that inside their nursing home, then that relieves the labs from being able to test more people.  So that’s really critical as well.
And then, finally, it’s also that path forward for patients, residents to be united with their families, because that point-of-care testing could also enable visitors.  So we’re very excited about that.  We think this is going to be very important for our nursing homes.
And also, one of the other things that we’re doing with our nursing homes across the country is making sure that they have the support.  We’ve engaged our quality improvement organizations to go inside nursing homes.  So once inspectors have identified problems, we’re actually putting organizations on the ground to provide them the support, answer any questions, and make sure that they have a safe environment for residents.
The other piece that the Vice President mentioned today was the HHS Protect system.  And we announced this week that we are putting up a system which allows our hospitals to directly report information to HHS.  And they — the type of information that they’re reporting are their inpatient beds, their ICU capacity.  That gives us the ability to make sure that they have the supplies that they need, whether it’s remdesivir, whether it’s N95 masks.
Us understanding what’s going on in the hospital, in terms of their capacity, the patients they’re seeing, is so critical.  And we appreciate the hospitals across the country that have voluntarily provided that data to us.  And it’s just so critical to making sure that those healthcare heroes that are on the frontlines have the supplies and the support that they need.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Great.

5:10 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, and good afternoon.  Today, I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control.  It seems largely in Sun Belt but could be spreading.
My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package.  We’re working very hard on it.  We’re making a lot of progress.  I also know that both sides want to get it done.  We’ll call it “phase four.”  I think we’re going to get it done.  We’ll protect our workers, our schools, and our families, and protect them very strongly.
As one family, we mourn every precious life that’s been lost.  I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus.  We’re doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development.  But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders.  The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave.
My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important.  We’ve learned so much about this disease.  And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them.
And again, the vaccines are coming, and they’re coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years.  If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years.
The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we’ve learned a great deal about it and who it targets.  We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful.  We’ve developed them as we go along.  Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well.  It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better — something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.  It’s the way — it’s what we have.  If you look over the world, it’s all over the world, and it tends to do that.
The governors are working very, very hard, and we are supporting them 100 percent.  Everything they need, they get.  And we are taking good care.  We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it’s ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need.  So that’s a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards.
The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old.  Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care.  In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it’s heart or diabetes, but usually it’s some kind of a condition.  It seems that people have that.  And if they do, it’s a problem — no question about it.
Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms.  They won’t even know they’re sick.  They won’t have any idea that they have a virus.  They won’t have any idea at all.
America’s youth will act responsibly, and we’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask.  Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.  They’ll have an effect.  And we need everything we can get.
Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk.  99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults.  Think of that. So that’s much, much, much less than 1 percent for children, young people.
By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we’ve been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States.  In fact, we’ll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world.  We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment.  And we have many more happening and coming out.
We’ve learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we’ve shared them all over the world.  The relationship with other countries has been very strong.  We’re all working together.  This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment, including high-flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators.
And when you’re on a ventilator, we’ve learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator.  And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators.  But the doctors have become incredibly — and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure.
And allocating remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization.  And that’s something that they’ve really started.  They’re using it much earlier.  Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April.  It’s a great number.
As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit states, which you’re looking at right now, we’re surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics.  We again have tremendous amounts of supplies.  We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly.
Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world.  If you watch American television, you’d think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus.  Well, the world is suffering very badly.  But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they’ve been suffering from this virus for a long time.
We’ve done much better than most.  And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it’s something that we can talk about, but we’re working, again, with them because we’re helping a lot of countries that people don’t even know about.  I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators.  They need help with ventilators; they have to get them.  They’re very hard to get.  We’re making thousands now a month — thousands of ventilators a month.  It’s been quite amazing.
We keep doing the good job, and things will get better and better.  We’ll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success and, I guess you could say also, things that we can do better on.  But you’ll see them.  There’ll be put up as we go.
In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old.  Today, the average age is significantly younger.  Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April.  So the stays are about half.  The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced.  And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one half of what it was in April.
We’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it.  The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators but in many other things.  And things are happening too, like the remdesivir and other elements, steroids, et cetera.
But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus.  And that’s what we have — we have a relentless focus.  And it’s been that way from the beginning.  But we have learned so much.
As you know, in recent weeks we’ve seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our south — if you look at South, Southwest, and West.  This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18- to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic.
We’re also facing the challenge of a significant spice[spike] in virus cases across the rest of the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico.  Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard.  As you know, the president, a great gentleman, was here two weeks ago.  And they have really been hit hard.
Because we’ve achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in two months, we’re successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases.  Some cases so mild that you really don’t even treat them.  Some cases with children, where they don’t even know that they’re ill.  And I guess they’re not very ill because they recover almost immediately.
Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50 percent more tests than Europe, and we’ve conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the Western Hemisphere combined.  We’ll be over 50 million tests.  This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms.  So we know exactly where it’s going and when it’s going to be there.
We’re also working to reduce turnaround time.  My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt, and we continue to do so, working very close with all governors, but right now, in particular, those governors.
We’re coordinating closely with hospitals and governors.  In the last three weeks, I’ve sent senior officials into nine states to meet with governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the state, including hospital administrators, et cetera.
My administration currently has zero unfilled requests for — unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the governors.  No governor needs anything right now, and we think we’ll have it that way until the end, because, frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go.
We have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that’s helping us greatly.  I want to thank them very much.  The military has been fantastic.
We’re closely monitoring hospital capacity in these states.  Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures.  So hospitals are open for elective surgeries.
We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need.  All of the governors we’ve spoken with say they have enough bed capacity.  That’s a great thing.  Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators.
And a permanent shutdown was really never an option.  In terms of what we’re doing right now, this would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences.  There are consequences to shutdowns.
And we’ve saved, potentially, millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown, but now we’re very aware of this disease.  We understand the disease, to a large extent.  Nobody is going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we’ll end up with a cure, we’ll end up with therapeutics, we’ll end up with a vaccine very soon — all three.
We’re instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene — wash your hands every chance you get — while sheltering high-risk populations.  We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.  Be safe and be smart.
We’re surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases.  This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the South.  We’re being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes, because you know all of the problems that we’ve had with so many people — so sadly, they were infected — so that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else.  That’s really the high-risk people — the high-risk, wonderful people.
Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference.  Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic but to end it.  We want to get rid of it as soon as we can.  That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority.
Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month.  This was achieved in record time.  It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now.  Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks, and we’re mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately.
And logistically, we have the military ready to go.  We have great people — logistic, military people.  A wonderful general who’s waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time.  That’s what’s going to happen.  So our military is all set to go.  We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is that’s necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all.
And I’ll take a few questions if you’d like.
I will say this: I want to thank all of the staff — the White House staff, all of the doctors that we’ve been working with so closely.  And just a lot of very positive things are happening.  It’s a nasty, horrible disease that should’ve never been allowed to escape China, but it did.  And it infected the world, and the world is suffering.  But we’re going to get it taken care of, and we’re helping lots of other countries.

11:16 A.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good morning, everyone.  By any objective standard, the violence, chaos, and anarchy in Portland is unacceptable, yet Democrats continue to put politics above peace while this President seeks to restore law and order.
Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat — Governor of Oregon — said that the President should, quote, “stop playing politics,” called law enforcement officers “secret police,” and likened it to, quote, a “dictatorship.”  The governor also called on the president to get his officers off the streets.
Democrat mayor of Portland, Todd Wheeler, said the President is “trying to look strong for his base” while you had Democrats on the Hill, Nancy Pelosi, calling these officers stormtroopers and Jim Clyburn calling them the Gestapo.
This rhetoric is unhelpful and gives the violence we have seen a pass.  But President Trump will not give the violence a pass.  He will restore order where the Democrat governor and the Democrat mayor are unwilling to admit that they have lost control of their city.
The well-organized mob in Portland has become increasingly aggressive, especially against law enforcement officers. Individuals have thrown bricks, chunks of concrete, glass bottles, feces, balloons filled with paint, pig’s feet, slingshots to hurl ball bearings and batteries at federal agents and the courthouse.
Multiple attempts to barricade officers in the Hatfield Courthouse have occurred; attempts to start the structure on fire as well.  Use of eyesight-damaging laser devices have been used, and strobe lights against federal agents as well.  But according to Speaker Pelosi, when asked about the violent removal of statues, “people will do what they do.”
The Trump administration urges state and local officials to work cooperatively to restore law and order.  Operation LeGend is a great example of this.  At the governor’s request, we went into Kansas City and surged the area with federal assets — FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals.  This was named after LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old young boy who lost his life and was shot in his bed tragically.
This has been a successful operation that has been waged in his name, including the arrest of wanted fugitives.  Similarly, President Trump is taking action in Portland, even though you have a Democrat mayor and Democrat governor unwilling to work with us in this situation.  We are surging resources, along with Secretary Wolf at DHS, and augmenting the Federal Protective Service to safeguard federal property.
The bottom line is that this President stands with law and order, which leads to peace.  And we will not allow Portland to become the new CHOP, like what we saw in Seattle.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

2:30 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This afternoon, President Trump will deliver remarks on rolling back regulations to help all Americans.  Deregulation has been a top priority of this President.  The President reversed the disastrous over-regulation of the Obama-Biden administration.  Under President Trump, seven deregulatory actions have been taken for every one new regulation.  This amounted to $50 billion in regulatory cost savings.
And it is important to note that this deregu- — deregulation agenda lowers costs for every American.  The cost of these burdensome regulations fall disproportionately and benefit disproportionately lower-income Americans.  So this President took action to roll back the burdensome regulations that harm low-income communities and make sure that these lower-income Americans are taken care of.
For example, the President’s deregulatory agenda will boost household income by $3,100 annually.  Thanks to President Trump’s rolling back of the Obama-Biden-era CAFE standards, family — families will have access to cheaper cars.  The President’s healthcare deregulation will also save patients nearly 10 percent on prescription drug costs.
These real wins for the American people will disappear with a re-regulation agenda, which is why President Trump will continue to pursue his historic deregulatory activity.
On another note: We saw encouraging news yesterday on vaccines.  Moderna’s vaccine candidate is showing promising signs.  They produced a positive, neutral immune response among the 45 participants in the study.  This is comparable to what we see in recovered patients.  And the bottom line is that, so far, we are seeing exactly what you would hope to see in a vaccine.   They’re expected — the Moderna vaccine in particular is expected to reach phase three by late July, with 30,000 participants
And finally, on the therapeutics front, I just want to note: A very encouraging Regeneron contract.  A $450 million contract for a monoclonal antibody cocktail.  This is a bioengineered version of convalescent plasma, one of the several therapeutics available to treat COVID.  It can be used for prophylaxis and treatment.  And they say they could have up to 70 to 300 thousand doses — vials of this by the end of the summer or early fall.
So Operation Warp Speed continues.  We continue to see encouraging news on the therapeutics front.  And with that, I will take your questions.

Baton Rouge, Louisiana

3:00 P.M. CDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’ve had a very productive day.  I want to thank Governor John Bel Edwards for the briefings that we received today.  I also want to thank — I want to thank the entire team here at LSU for the hospitality.  We — it’s exciting to be in Tiger Stadium, but it’s inspiring to be on a campus and in a state that are making plans not just to open up the economy again, but to open up our schools again.  And we’re, we’re truly grateful — truly grateful for the time and the opportunity.
President Trump asked me to be here to send a very clear message to the people of Louisiana: That we’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you until we put this coronavirus completely in the past and we open up this economy, open up our schools, and we move this state and this nation forward bigger and better than ever before.
I’m particularly, as I said, grateful for Governor John Bel Edwards for the partnership that we’ve enjoyed over the past four months.  Louisiana is really in a unique position.  As we’ve seen rising cases across the Sun Belt, it was here in Louisiana that the people of this state, your state leadership, your healthcare workers have already demonstrated that people of Louisiana know how to slow the spread.  They know how to flatten the curve.  They did it before, and we’re very confident Louisiana is going to do it again, as we see rising cases now across the state.
I also want to express appreciation to Senator Bill Cassidy and Senator John Kennedy for their strong support.  The CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program, the direct support for families would not have been possible without their stalwart support in the United States Senate.
Let me also say how grateful we are to Louisiana’s House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise, for his great leadership, as well as other members of the delegation who have joined us for all of our discussions today: Congressman Garret Graves, Congressman Ralph Abraham, and Congressman Mike Johnson.
The people of Louisiana would be proud.  And President Trump and I are truly grateful for the spirit of partnership with your elected representatives in Washington, D.C., but also with your governor and with this administration.  It has — it has truly been inspiring, and we’re going to continue that partnership every day until — until we put this coronavirus in the past.
Let me be clear: The rising cases across the Sun Belt are serious, and we are going to continue to ensure that Louisiana and all of the affected states have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and the medicines to save lives, to slow the spread.
But while the rise in cases is serious, the people of this state and this nation deserve to know that our ability to respond to this pandemic is substantially better than two and three months ago, when the coronavirus first came to Louisiana.
Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, thanks to the strong partnership we forged with your governor, the support of these members of the Senate and the House, and the extraordinary healthcare workers here in Louisiana and all across this country, we are in a much stronger position to save lives, to protect the most vulnerable, to flatten the curve, and to continue to open up Louisiana and open up America.
Today, we had particular focus on education.  And as I said, being here at the LSU campus, we’re — we’re grateful for the innovative efforts that LSU and that Louisiana, broadly, are taking to open up our schools.
As President Trump has made it clear, as we — to open up America, we got to open up America’s schools.  We believe it’s absolutely in the best interest of students academically and in terms of every aspect of their personal wellbeing to get kids back in the classroom in K-12, and to get students back on campuses, like LSU.
And as we told the faculty here at this great campus, and we assured the governor today, we’re going to continue to make the testing and the PPE and the supplies available to support the reopening of schools all across this state and all across this country.
We’re also going to continue to scale supplies to meet this moment in Louisiana and beyond.  And in just the last several days, the Administrator of FEMA, Pete Gaynor, was here in Louisiana.  He’ll be visiting a local school, I’m told, with Congressman Scalise tomorrow.
This week alone, at the President’s direction, FEMA has deployed military medical personnel to some of the states most impacted.  And we learned today that Louisiana will be making a request for medical personnel, much like those we provided to Louisiana earlier in this pandemic.  And we’ll be moving quickly to respond to that.
We’ve been distributing medicines like remdesivir.  We’ve deployed 19 HHS teams to metropolitan areas around the country impacted by this pandemic.  There’ll be eight more teams deployed in the next several days.  And we’ve been expanding testing and the supplies that support testing.
At the present moment, with the great work of Admiral Brett Giroir, as a member of our task force, we’ve performed more than 40 million tests nationwide, more than — there was a day in just the last week when we actually performed over 800,000 desks [sic] — tests in a single day.  And we’re — we’re incredibly inspired by Louisiana’s innovation from very early on in expanding testing — well above the national average, and we’ll continue to support efforts in that regard.
Also, we were pleased to announce that we were unveiling three different surge testing sites in states around the country.  One includes four locations in Baton Rouge, including LSU’s Alex Box Stadium.  It’ll be for those with symptoms or those who believe they’ve been exposed.  And we’ll be doing a quick turnaround on testing.  This is part of our community testing and surveillance efforts.  And we’ve already deployed those personnel and resources here in Louisiana.
There’s one announcement we informed governors yesterday of that I want to ask Seema Verma, the administrator of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and Admiral Giroir to step to the podium to describe.  We’ve often said the first mission of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, at the President’s direction, was to save lives.  Our mission today is to save lives, to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable, to open up America and open up America’s schools.
But one of the ways that we protect the most vulnerable is by ensuring, as you’ve done so here in Louisiana, to make sure that those who live in long-term care and nursing home facilities have the testing and the PPE support.  And we have a very significant announcement about the deployment of testing resources to our nursing homes, and I’d like to invite my colleagues on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to step forward and describe it.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  You know, from day one, as the Vice President said, we’ve had a focus on protecting the most vulnerable citizens, and that includes our nursing home residents.  And it’s been a very difficult time for them — restriction of visitors, restriction of activities.  But today’s announcement about providing point-of-care tests in every nursing home across the country is very significant.
This is going to allow our nursing homes to test their workers on a weekly basis and also test their patients as well.  And this is important because when they identify a patient that could be potentially — that is infected with the coronavirus or even a staff member, it allows them to do the important work around isolating that patient.  And this is also a significant step forward in reuniting patients with their families, because once we know that the facility is free of the coronavirus, it allows visitors to also come back in.  So this is a very important step.
And thanks to Dr. Giroir for his efforts to make this happen.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, Administrator Verma.  As a native of Louisiana, it’s always great to be back here, and I really feel just wonderful being here in Tiger Stadium.  I did want to say, by any measure, Louisiana, in terms of testing, is in the top 10 states nationally.  And by a couple of measures, they’re either number one or number two — not quite good enough for Coach O, but you’re going to be there very soon.  (Laughter.)
The announcement today is really significant, and let me amplify on Administrator Verma.  It’s very important to protect our vulnerable.  And we know that our elderly in nursing homes are among the most vulnerable, and that’s why we’ve leaned in so heavily with them.  In order to protect them, we recommend that the staff be tested once a week to make sure that they don’t bring, unintentionally, maybe even without symptoms, the virus into the nursing home.  That means 4 to 5 million tests per month.  And, as you know, the turnaround times — because there’s so much testing — is getting a bit longer, and it’s also very expensive.
What we’re talking about today is providing a point of care — that means a rapid, on-the-spot, 20-tests-per-hour instrument, along with tests, to every single of the 15,400 nursing homes within this country.  We’re starting next week with 2,000 of them, ranked by Administrator Verma and her team, that are at risk because of spread in the community.  Seventeen of those are right here in Baton Rouge.  We’re going to start that next week.  This is a very, very significant moment to protect our seniors.  Over the following ensuing weeks, we’re going to distribute to all the rest of the 13,400.
Just to make one comment: This is not an acquisition.  It’s not just writing a check and doing it.  This has been the culmination of about two months of work to develop the technology; to increase the sensitivity of the tests to make sure they’ll be highly protective of investments in manufacturing, in regulatory flexibility with the FDA; to bring it all together; and then, as part of a comprehensive plan, to protect our seniors.
So, I tell you, in the last two and a half years, I’ve been very honored to be a part of a lot of efforts of this administration.  I can tell you this one is going to save thousands of lives.  So this is a really historic moment.  It’s a great moment for our seniors and for those 17 nursing homes in Baton Rouge who will be getting it next week.  All hands on deck.  We’re here to support you.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
So before I turn it over to the governor, let me just — let me just say on behalf of the President and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, that: Governor Edwards, we support your efforts here in Louisiana to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable, to keep opening up your economy and opening up your schools.
But it’s important to remember we all have a role to play, so we want to encourage all the people of Louisiana and all those looking on to continue to adhere to the guidance of your state and local health officials.  Put into practice those commonsense steps that flattened the curve here in Louisiana before and will slow the spread and flatten the curve again: wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask.  Wear a mask whenever state and local authorities say it’s indicated or whenever social distancing is not possible.
Each and every one of us has a role to play.  And we’ll be able to continue to open up.  Now, Governor, I know you have made a decision to pause reopening, to stay at phase two, and we support your decision in that regard.  We’ll continue to flow testing and PPE and resources to support the implementation of your policy.
But I want to assure everyone in Louisiana and all those looking on that we’re opening up America again, and we’re dealing with rising cases across the Sun Belt.  It’s not either/ or.  We don’t have to choose between continuing to open up our economy, making plans to open up our schools, and doing what each and every one of us needs to do to slow the spread and flatten the curve.  Here in Louisiana, you did it before, and we’re very confident that you will do it again.  Because here in Louisiana, you know what the American people know: is that we’re all in this together.
I read a — I read a verse in my devotions this morning that we’re called to run the race marked out for us with endurance and with faith.  And I’m confident that with the endurance, the perseverance, and the faith of the people of this great state and this nation, that we’ll every day be one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past.
And we pledge to continue to work with your governor, with your leaders in Washington, D.C., and with all the great healthcare workers of this state to hasten that day.
Governor?
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I want to thank you for visiting Baton Rouge and Louisiana and bringing Ambassador Birx and Administrator Verma with you, as well as Secretary DeVos and Admiral Giroir.  And I want to thank our congressional delegation.
You know, talking about how we’re number one or number two, and so forth, in testing, I will tell you: It wouldn’t be possible without the support we’ve received from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
And I will tell you that, this week, we will exceed a million tests that we’ve conducted since the beginning.  We’re at 248,000 tests, to date, for the month of July, and that’s less than halfway through the month.  And that’s critically important.  But what the tests are telling us is we have more cases, we have rising positivity, and certainly we know from our hospitals that we have increasing hospitalizations as well.
And my commitment to the Vice President is the same as it is to the people of Louisiana: We’re going to do what’s required to get back in front of this virus and flatten the curve again, and make sure that we are protecting the most vulnerable, that we are saving lives.  And the way that we can reopen our economy, reopen our schools are to do those things that are essential to make sure that we can be successful.  And it’s — it’s really pretty simple at this point.
We don’t want to go backwards to phase one or to phase zero.  So we can — we can continue in phase two, but we are going to have to make sure that we wear the mask, that we social distance, that we limit our social gatherings in terms of the number of people.  And if we will do that, we’re going to be successful, and we don’t have to go — to go back.  And we are going to open our schools and so forth.
And everything we’re going to do, we’re going to do in consultation with the CDC guidelines, the guidance that’s put out by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and certainly working with our own professionals here at the Office of Public Health.  And we’re going to work with all of our local officials and the health community here, because they have been the true heroes.
And we’re going to be successful.  We are going to get back on top of this.  We’re going to flatten the curve.  And we look forward to the day, as the Vice President mentioned — he and President Trump are working — that we put this virus behind us.  And we’re going to work extremely hard.
And, please, Mr. Vice President, know we appreciate your visit.  I appreciate the attention you’ve paid to this state, to the time that you’ve given personally to speak with me anytime that I called, and for all of the assistance that we have received.  Our state is much better off today because of that assistance and because of your work and the work of your task force and our congressional delegation.
And while I know we have a lot of work to do ahead of us, I am optimistic that we’re going to get it done, and we’re going to come through this in fine fashion.  And I’m also praying for that result as well.  I believe in prayer, and I believe in work, and we’re going to do both here in Louisiana because that’s what we’ve done as long as we’ve been a state.
So I want to thank you again for being here.  And I believe, at this point, we’re going to hear from our senior —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)  Dr. Birx.
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  I’m sorry.  Dr. Birx.  I was going to say senior citizen, but she’s not a senior citizen.  (Laughter.)
DR. BIRX:  No, you had that right.
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you very much, Ambassador.
DR. BIRX:  You had that right, Governor.  Thank you, governor.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you to our senators, our congressional members here today.  And thank you to Courtney Phillips and her public health team.
The epidemic you’re facing today in Louisiana is different than the epidemic that you had in March and April that was very much centered in New Orleans and a little bit in Baton Rouge.
This particular epidemic, although the cases are still low, is spread across the state of Louisiana.  And that’s why the Governor is correct: It will take everyone in Louisiana, every single person in Louisiana, to wear a mask.  It will take all of those residents to social distance, to practice personal hygiene.
And as Coach O has explained to me, he was able to keep his football players safe and healthy and well here, and tested, until some might have wandered off to a bar.  And after wandering off to a bar, they did become positive.  And so he’s made it clear that that is not on, any longer, the itinerary for practice.
And so we are really calling on all Louisianans to not be going to bars, not to be even going to bars in people’s houses.  Social gathering of more than 10 people right now is particularly difficult with the type of spread that you have.  But it is this public health group and this governor who was able to stop a very serious epidemic in New Orleans.
And it’s why these cases are still low that we have the opportunity to change the future for Louisiana and be able to decrease the number of cases every day if each of us wear our masks, stay out of bars, make sure you don’t have large gatherings in your households, and really protect one another, and do what we always have said: protecting the most vulnerable in all age groups that may have comorbidities because of their higher risk of severe disease.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
SENATOR CASSIDY:  I will speak as a physician who happens to be a doctor.  And I compliment — one, I thank you all for being here.  I compliment you for recognizing that this is a public health crisis, which has led to an educational crisis, which has led to an economic crisis, which has led to an employment crisis, a family crisis, if you will.  And we only get out of the economic, the educational, the employment, the family crisis if we do something about the public health crisis.
Now, there’s a lot to be said about that, but I’ll just give the local inflection today that I was particularly proud of: LSU and Southern spoke about their partnership, about how they would wish to safely reopen their schools so their children — the students can come back and graduate, but not just that: recognizing that some of the risk factors for having a worse episode of coronavirus infection — the obesity, diabetes, hypertension, minority race — are represented in our state.
We have the ability to not only keep our state healthier, but to learn lessons that will benefit the rest of the nation and the rest of the world.  And that will be our unique contribution to unraveling the public health crisis, which therefore makes the education, the employment, the employer, and all other aspects of this that much better.
So again, Mr. Vice President and your team: Thank you for coming.  And we, in Louisiana, just look forward to working with you for those solutions.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator.
SENATOR KENNEDY:  As I have said repeatedly today, Vice President Pence has been a powerful partner to President Trump, and he honors us with his presence today, as do — as does each member of his entire team.  I’ve gotten to know Mike Pence well.  He has been a rock, and he has been a rockstar for the American people.
Second and final point: Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Austria, South Korea, Japan, even Vietnam, for God’s sakes, have opened their schools, and they’ve done so safely.  And so can America and so should America.
We have lost 30 precious lives to the coronavirus of kids under the age of 15, and that is 30 too many.  But the point is: Our kids don’t seem to be as susceptible to the virus as adults.  If we used our head, we can open our schools safely.  I can promise you that not opening our schools will do our children so much more harm than the coronavirus ever can.
In Louisiana, for many of our children, our schools are the most stable things in their lives, and that’s what we need to work hard on every single day.
Finally, our universities can help us.  All of our universities in Louisiana are going to be open this fall.  Our public labs have done a wonderful job.  Our private labs have done a wonderful job.  Many of our university labs have done a wonderful job.  But I’m going to challenge our universities today, right here in Louisiana and elsewhere: Step up to the plate.  Help us do more testing.  That’ll get — help us get elementary and secondary education back on its feet.
Once again, thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to your entire team.  And to the governor, I want to thank all of them for giving so much to Louisiana and to America.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Please, Congressman.
REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE:  Well, I want to really welcome Vice President Mike Pence to Tiger Stadium.  As an Indiana Hoosier, we appreciate that he’s come here today.  But Vice President Pence has been here every time we’ve needed him.  The Trump administration, top down, every time there’s been — whether it’s a shortage of PPE, additional relief packages — the Trump administration and this task force led by Vice President Pence have been nonstop working to make sure that we have the things that we need to continue to confront this pandemic.
It’s still out there, but we also know that we’ve got to start safely reopening, as Governor Edwards has led the way to show that we can open our schools; that we have to open our schools.  It’s not a question of whether or not the schools will reopen; it’s how best to safely reopen.
And today’s roundtable was really informative, as we saw the heads of the LSU system, the Southern System, student body president representing the University of Louisiana system talking about the importance of safely reopening schools.  It’s got to be our challenge to ensure that we’re there for our kids to make sure that they can go back to school and they can go back in a safe way.  It’s not the same thing to be taught at home.
Not only do they need that instruction, but we’ve seen psychiatrists giving studies, we’ve seen pediatrics studies that have shown the damage it causes to our kids not being in school.  So it’s our challenge to make sure that we put the protocols out there to safely reopen.  And I appreciate Vice President Pence’s leadership in doing that.
And I also want to thank the Vice President and his whole team.  Of course, Admiral Giroir, good to see you back here in Louisiana, but you’re doing a great service to our nation.  And CMS Administrator Seema Verma — what they just announced today, don’t underestimate how important that is.  When you look at the crisis and the deaths: Over 40 percent of America’s deaths from coronavirus have happened to seniors in nursing homes.  They represent less than 1 percent of America’s population, yet account for over 40 percent of the deaths.  And as we’ve dug into the data to find out who to protect and how best to protect people all across the country, we know the most vulnerable.  And the fact that they’re going to be putting these testing facilities into every nursing home in America is a revolutionary breakthrough.
What you’ve done with Operation Warp Speed to find cures, to find vaccines, the testing that’s being done today, and the red tape that’s being removed by agencies like the FDA, I can’t thank President Trump and Vice President Pence enough for their efforts to lead us through this so that we ultimately find a vaccine, find a cure.  But in the meantime — and, by the way, over 70,000 vials of remdesivir that have been allocated to Louisiana from the National Stockpile; thank you for that, Mr. Vice President — but we’re going to continue working at warp speed to address this.
But it’s critical that we reopen our schools, and I appreciate the conversation we had here today to get that done, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Steve.  And before we go to questions, I’d like the Secretary of Education, Secretary Betsy DeVos, to step forward.  She has literally been traveling the country, working with states and school systems around America to get our kids back in the classroom.
Madam Secretary.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you so much for convening us here today, for your and President Trump’s leadership during this time.  I will just reflect again what so many have said up here in the last few moments: that our kids have got to get back to school.  And it’s not a matter of if; it’s just a matter of how.
There are so many ways that we can think outside of the box how to address specific needs.  But as — as has been noted, the question of a child’s health is a multi-dimensional one.  And we know that too many kids today have been harmed by being at home these last several months.  Their mental wellbeing, their social-emotional growth, and particularly those that are most vulnerable among us have been harmed by not being able to continue their learning and continue to be in classrooms with their teachers and their peers.
So I know that Americans are a people of great determination and action and can-do spirit.  And this is a great opportunity for adults to step up and show and demonstrate and model grit and determination to ensure that kids can continue their learning come fall.  And I and my team and, I know, this whole administration stands ready to help and support in every way we possibly can.  And we look forward to all of the creative solutions that we’re going to see across this country.
So, thank you again, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of this task force and your and the President’s continued commitment to the future of this nation.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Madam Secretary.  With that, questions.  We’ve got time for a few questions before we have to go.
Go ahead.  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-baton-rouge-la/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  President Trump will participate in a roundtable to hear stories of families positively impacted by law enforcement.  That will be taking place shortly after this briefing concludes.  The President stands with our police officers, our men and women across this country who valiantly patrol our streets and protect our protect our citizenry.
This President stands on the side of law and order to secure peace in our streets.  That has always been his priority, and remains so today.
Tragically, this weekend, we saw a devastating ambush attack against brave law enforcement officers in McAllen, Texas: Officer Edelmiro Garza, Jr., who was 45 years old, and Officer Ismael Chavez, who was 39 years old.  And while responding to a domestic disturbance call, Officers Garza and Chavez arrived on scene to protect the people that they serve.  They were met with gunfire.  They were ambushed by a violent and dangerous suspect who horrifically shot before they even drew their weapon or had a chance to call for backup.
We honor the lives and the service of Officer Garza and Officer Chavez.  This President will always stand on the side of law enforcement and the heroes who protect and serve.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

2:05 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  There has been no greater champion for rectifying racial and income disparities in America’s educational system than President Trump.
Every child regardless of race, income level, or zip code deserves an equal playing field of opportunity to access the American Dream.  Making that goal a reality begins in our schools.  The evidence is clear: An analysis of 41 major urban areas found that black and Hispanic students made the largest gains in educational access because of school choice, according to a CREDO study.
That is why President Trump has been clear in saying in his State of the Union: “For too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools.  To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships.  The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.”  Now I go — “I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity…Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act,” he said, “because no parents should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.”
Well, now, if Democrats have their way, children will not have access to schools at all.  And that is not acceptable to President Trump.  President Trump continues to fight for equal opportunity in our schools by boldly and firmly underscoring the absolute necessity of America’s schools to reopen this fall.  The data is clear: Sustained school closures hurt students who have fewer resources the most.
McKinsey and Co. created these models — I have some graphs for you — to estimate the potential impact of school closures, and they found this, quote: “How much learning students lose during school closures vary significantly by access to remote learning, the quality of remote instruction, home support, and the degree of engagement.”
As you can see in this chart, students who experience average-quality remote learning progress, but at a slower pace; students who are getting lower-quality remote learning stagnate at current grade levels; and students who are not getting instruction at home lose significant ground with some students dropping out altogether.
As you can see in the three scenarios mapped on this graph, if students return to school in the fall, the disparities are far less than if they return in January of next year or the fall of next year, where disparities and learning are enormous.
But school closures affect more than just learning.  As the NAACP has pointed out, “For students of color at all levels across the country, school closings create problems even more urgent than the interruption of their educations.  Schools also serve as a community nexus for food and for housing.”
Rest assured that President Trump knows more than anyone the importance of opening our schools, which is why he has been the most vocal advocate for reopening.  And President Trump’s America — make no mistake that he will continue to be the biggest fighter for equal opportunity in our schools and continued access to the American Dream for all.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-9-2020/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Today, President Trump welcomed to the White House President López Obrador of Mexico.  The meeting reaffirmed the incredibly strong ties between President Obrador and President Trump.  The leaders noted that many people have bet against their ability to work together in a strong and productive fashion.  But rest assured, they work together, and they work together well.  The U.S.-Mexico relationship has never been stronger or more productive, thanks to the leadership of President Trump.
The USMCA, in particular, is a major win for our two countries and for America’s workers.  Under the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement, more than 4 million man — manu- — excuse me, more than 4 million manufacturing jobs will be regained that were lost under NAFTA.  This will be a huge influx of American jobs that were lost under the failed NAFTA trade deal that went into effect.
In addition, tens of thousands of manufacturing plants were lost because of NAFTA; we want to bring those on shore.  And the USMCA will go a long way in bringing back those manufacturing plants and those millions of jobs that were lost under NAFTA.
NAFTA was a bad deal for the American worker because it left American workers behind.  Many politicians forgot the damage wrought by disastrous trade deals such as NAFTA, but President Trump did not forget.  It took this President to change the status quo, renegotiate NAFTA, and secure a better deal for the American worker.
And here’s why: The USMCA alone will create 176,000 American jobs.  We believe the other trade deals that this President has negotiated will add to that number and help undo a lot of what NAFTA has done.  The USMCA will boost American manufacturing, including wages, new jobs, and exports.  And the USMCA will create 76,000 auto manufacturing jobs, crucial to the wellbeing of this country.
The USMCA is good for business, as President Trump rebuilds the strongest, most inclusive economy in history.  The USMCA will help jumpstart our economy.  The USMCA is projected to increase GDP by $235 billion.  This means jobs, jobs, jobs.
And during today’s meeting between the presidents, one official from Mexico noted that many considered the USMCA an 80/20 probability.  Now, it is 100 percent certainty.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-8-2020/

Washington, D.C.
11:41 A.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good morning all.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, here at the Department of Education, as part of our ongoing effort to focus on a mission to save lives, meet the needs of our states and our healthcare workers, to protect the vulnerable, and to safely reopen America and reopen America’s schools.
As you will hear today from Admiral Brett Giroir, at this point, we have tested more than 39 million Americans.  Among those, more than 3 million Americans have tested positive and more than 1.3 million Americans have recovered.  Sadly, more than 133,000 Americans have lost their lives, and our sympathies are with all of the impacted families.
And while we mourn with those who mourn, because of what the American people have done, because of the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers around the country, we are encouraged that the average fatality rate continues to be low and steady.  And at days earlier this week, it was actually 90 percent lower than at the height of this pandemic.
Again, it’s a credit to the sacrifices the American people have made, to the extraordinary work that our healthcare workers are doing.  And we pledge that this task force, working in partnership with governors all across the country, is going to continue to work our hearts out 24 hours a day to continue to keep our losses low.
In just a few moments, Dr. Deborah Birx will outline the data that we’re seeing around the country.  We’re tracking literally state by state, county by county.  But as she will describe in a moment, we’re actually seeing early indications of a percent of positive testing flattening in Arizona and Florida and Texas.  Governors in each of those states have taken strong steps to flatten the curve.  And again, as Dr. Birx will describe, we’re beginning to see early indications that positivity is flattening, and in Arizona and Florida, we’re beginning to see declining numbers of emergency room visits as well.
We believe the takeaway from this for every American, particularly in those states that are impacted, is: Keep doing what you’re doing, because we’re starting to see the first indications that as we were able to do in the Northeast, as we were able to do in New Orleans and Louisiana and Michigan and other places around the country, we’re putting into practice those mitigation efforts and we’re beginning to see indications that they are having a good effect.
We are focused on the states where more than half of the new cases have arisen — Texas, Arizona, Florida, and California — and have received encouraging reports even through this morning: strong supplies of PPE in hospitals; hospital capacity remains strong.
The one need that we did hear from governors across the region is for personnel.  And over the last week, working through FEMA, the Department of Defense, and HHS, we’ve been processing requests to deploy over 1,070 doctors and nurses and medical personnel.  At this point, roughly 525 doctors and nurses are on the ground in Arizona, California, and Texas, and we’re processing a request from Florida for an additional amount.
We’ve made it very clear as we — if you’ll recall, we deployed, at the President’s direction, active-duty military medical personnel to New York, to New Jersey, to Connecticut, to Michigan, to Louisiana, and we’re in the process of doing that again just to make sure that those dedicated doctors and nurses and healthcare workers have the relief that they need as we see cases rising in various communities across the Sun Belt.  And we’ll continue to work that.
We had a conference call yesterday with the nation’s governors.  We are in the process of continuing to send, every week, detailed county-by-county summaries, analysis, and recommendations to governors that are being — that are being implemented and well received.
We also are issuing renewed guidance on preservation and reuse of PPE.  Again, what we’re hearing, in not just speaking to governors but talking directly to hospitals, is that, frankly, because of the historic effort that President Trump implemented to spin up hundreds of millions of supplies of gloves and masks and face shields and — as well as the construction of ventilators — we now have 59,000 ventilators in our supplies — PPE, we hear, remains very strong, but we’re encouraging healthcare workers to begin now to use some of the best practices that we learned in other parts of the country to preserve and to reuse the PPE supplies.
So our focus is to make sure our states have everything they need, when they need it.  And we’re working closely with all the governors to make that a reality.  But what brings us to the Department of Education is, as we — as we see to the needs of our states and we focus on the healthcare of the American people, we’re working to reopen America and to reopen America’s schools.
And yesterday, President Trump convened a summit of education leaders and health officials at the White House.  And as the President made clear yesterday: It’s time.  It’s time for us to get our kids back to school.  And the summit yesterday gave us an opportunity to outline and to learn what we might be able to do then.
In just a few moments, I’m going to ask Secretary DeVos to talk about the approach the Department of Education is taking to assisting local communities and states in bringing their schools back online.  And also, we’ll hear from Dr. Bob Redfield, who has been literally, since early in this pandemic, providing guidance to schools and will be issuing additional guidance next week.
I wouldn’t want to pass the opportunity, though, not just as Vice President but as someone who’s been married to a school teacher now for 35 years, just to say — to say thank you to all the teachers out there.  From early in this pandemic, teachers learned how to do the distance teaching and did a remarkable job, oftentimes having to care for their own families and make sure their own children’s studies were happening.  So to all of our — America’s teachers, we say thank you.
We also want to say thank you to the parents — the parents who had to step in and become educators for all of their kids.  It’s really been remarkable when you see what our kids have been able to accomplish during this difficult time.
But what we heard again yesterday from education officials and what we heard from the American Academy of Pediatrics: It’s absolutely essential that we get our kids back into a classroom for in-person learning.  We can’t let our kids fall behind academically, but it’s important that the American people remember that for children that have mental health issues, for special needs children, for nutrition for children in communities facing persistent poverty, the school is the place where they receive all those services.
And so this is not just simply about making sure our kids are learning and they’re advancing academically, but for their mental health, for their wellbeing, for their physical health, for nutrition.  We got to get our kids back to school.
And as you heard the President yesterday and even again this morning, we’re absolutely determined to work in partnership with our states to give the guidance for states and communities to be able to safely reopen our schools.  The CDC will be issuing new guidance next week — part of a five-part series of recommendations that will give all-new tools to our schools.
But what Dr. Redfield made clear yesterday I’m sure he’ll make clear again today, is: We’re here to help.  We don’t want federal guidance to be a substitute for state and local laws and rules and guidance.  We’re here to assist with the shared objective that I think is shared by every parent in America, which is we want to get our kids back.  We want to get them back in the classroom.  We want to get our teachers back in the front of those classrooms.  We got to get our kids learning, in person, once again.
As Congress is still in recess but will gather again soon, we already are in discussions about additional potential support, although we were able to remind governors that $13.3 billion is available in the CARES Act for states, to be able to assist them as they roll out and restart schools across the country.
At the present moment, we learned yesterday that only 1.5 percent of those funds has been drawn down by states, and we encouraged the governors to take advantage of that.
Our objectives, as I said, are to save lives, meet the needs of our states and their healthcare workers, protect the most vulnerable, and safely reopen America, and safely reopen our schools.
And the good news is we are — we are reopening America.  The jobs report last Thursday spoke for itself: Nearly 5 million jobs created.  And I can tell you, evidence all around the country is that the American people are finding a way to do their part to put the health of their neighbors first, even while we all find a way to get back to work, to worship, and to school.
And we all have a role to play to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable, and to safely reopen our country and our schools.  And so I would just — I would just close, before I turn the podium over to Dr. Birx for her report, just simply to say thank you to the American people.  Thank you for what you’ve done so far.  Thank you for the way you’ve put the health and wellbeing of not just family members and friends, but strangers — people you didn’t even know — first.
And we just encourage you to keep doing what you’re doing:  Keep heeding the guidance of state and local authorities.  Practice good hygiene.  Wash your hands.  Wear a mask wherever state and local authorities determine it’s indicated, or wear a mask where you can’t engage in social distancing.
This is the role each of us can continue to play, and we’re seeing some early indications in some of the most impacted states that Americans are doing just that.  So we want to encourage you on and tell you that we’re going to continue to do our part.
And I’m just absolutely confident — just as we proved when this pandemic was striking so deeply in the Northeast, when it was striking in Louisiana and in Michigan — the American people know what needs to be done, and we know we can do it.
And we flattened — we flattened the curve before, we slowed the spread before, and we can do it again.  But we’ve got to all do our part, and we’ll do it together.
With that, Dr. Deborah Birx.  And then we’ll get a report from Admiral Giroir before we move on to other reports.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  If I could have the first slide, please.  And I know some of you do watch what I wear, so I’m wearing this specially today.  This came from the Salt River tribe.  I just want to — masks can be a fashion statement.
And I want to thank the Salt River tribe.  It was a real pleasure to be out and speaking to individuals around the United States about the issues that they’re facing with COVID-19, to be able to meet with communities, hospital personnel, African American communities, Hispanic communities, and our (inaudible) tribal nations.  That was a privilege last week.
I want to start with Arizona, just to pick up where the Vice President left off.  That orange line is the number of tests performed, and the blue line is the test positivity.  Now, this is at the level of the state.  And Arizona does have three counties that we’re tracking very closely, obviously you know that the largest one being Phoenix and Maricopa County.  But this does show that the blue line, which is a five-day — a seven-day average — and thank you to the data team for these wonderful slides — the five — the seven-day average is showing some flattening, and we find that encouraging.
Also equally encouraging at this point — because we know that the test-positivity rate is the first thing to increase, and we’re hoping that it heralds a stability in Arizona of at least reaching a plateau in their curve.
The red line represents the emergency room visits for any of the COVID-like symptoms.  And this is also an early indicator, and we find that encouraging.
The next slide does show the counties that we’re tracking.  Obviously, the largest county being Maricopa County with the largest number of infections, but clearly there’s issues in Yuma and Pima.
The Vice President mentioned the weekly reports that go to governors.  This is what the report looks like.  It (inaudible) their full-side pages.
This is Alaska’s.  On the front page is our interpretation of what we’re seeing, relevant to their epidemic, with specific recommendations related to where we see them, as far as being in a danger zone.  They are coded by yellow and red.  And it follows that they see everything you’re seeing on that first report in boxes — warning boxes — and then each of the counties are represented so that they have, in one place, five pages from the White House and task force that summarizes what we’re seeing.  And that goes out weekly.
Next slide, please.
This looks at Florida, and you can see, in the same way, the red line — early suggestions of decreasing emergency room visits for the symptoms of COVID and some stability starting in that blue line.  Hoping that heralds stability in the number of daily reported cases.
We also understand that we went through a holiday weekend, and holiday weekends can impact datas on both ends: underreporting through the weekend and then catch-up reporting on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after a holiday weekend.
Next slide.
This shows the counties of Florida that we’re tracking.  These are the top 10 counties in Florida, and you can see each of them have a different profile.
I want to call your attention to the counties that are across the bottom there that are more difficult to see.  Some of those represent Jacksonville and other large metros, including Tampa.  When the governor talks about how they were “steady and low” for a long period of time after reopening, this is where that is reflected for almost five weeks after reopening.  Clearly, there was something that happened though.  And those that we’re looking into across the board — because whatever happened in Florida happened across the Sun Belt, and that all of the curves and all of the findings are mirrored.
If you remember early on in March and April, we were talking about, first, the New York metro, followed by Boston, followed by Philadelphia, then Chicago — and New Orleans was with the New York metro.  And so it was a series of individual curves.
In this case, whatever occurred occurred almost simultaneously across the South.  And so we’re investigating that very closely to really see the etiology behind that because that can help us as an early warning signal, but also help us in guidance to the American people of what we’re asking them to do.
Next slide.
Texas.  And you can see Texas is in a similar situation with their blue line.  And we’re watching this very closely across Texas.
Next slide.
But I think all of you know that there is a series of major metros in Texas with significant increase in cases from Houston to Dallas to San Antonio to El Paso and McAllen area.  And so the governors get this type of report with specific recommendations.
And then, finally, California, where you can see — next slide, thank you — again, a long time of stability, but then this increase in the number of test positives and rapid increase in cases.
Next slide.
And you can see the majority of the issue is in the Los Angeles area, although we see this through Riverside, Imperial, Sacramento, and now San Francisco with increased number of cases.
So I want to finish with where the Vice President started: about the sacrifices of the American people.  Because in that recommendations are very clear recommendations that when you have a county with these types of cases, we are recommending everyone using a face covering.  And I think the studies now that have been done, showing that cotton face coverings work, that does open up the ability for us all to have individualized face coverings that express our personality.
But in addition, I think the work that these governors have done to — and ask the American people is it’s stop going to bars, to close the bars, to move to outdoor dining, to decrease indoor — any kind of indoor gatherings again.  To all of the Americans out there that are in these four states and the states that have — in the report, were in the red zone — because there’s a series of other states that we have in that zone — is really asking the American people in those counties and in those states — in those states to not only use the face coverings — not going to bars, not going to indoor dining — but really not gathering in homes either and decreasing those gatherings back down to our phase one recommendation, which was 10 or less.
So, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Admiral, report on testing.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Since we’re bragging on our face coverings, this was made by a small religious community in Pennsylvania, who were helped by the Public Health Service, and they hand sewed these for a lot of our officers to match our operational dress — those blue uniforms.  So, I wear this proudly, and I think of that community every single day — everybody pitching in across America to help us all.
So, in terms of testing, I want to cover three quick topics.  First one is just where we are numerically.  The Vice President has already said, we are now topping 39 million tests across the country.  The states really crushed their goal in June.  The state goals was about 12.9 million in June; CDC numbers have finalized that at about 16 and a half million tests for June.  So, congratulations to almost all of the states who made their goal and exceeded their goal.
We’re doing very well right now, between 6- and 700,000 tests per day.  We did top the 700,000 mark last week, and we’re averaging about 620-630,000 tests per day.  We continue to ship.  We are ripe with swabs and media.  So the states tell us what they need.  We work with them to set those goals, based on their state testing plans.
After technical assistance by the CDC and my office, FEMA ships those every week.  Now that’s along with ASPR — the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response — at HHS.  So that’s sort of the overall general view.
We announced, yesterday, what we talked about a little bit last week, and that is federal surge sites.  We opened these in three communities.  There was a list of communities identified by Dr. Birx and her team that had certain characteristics of their infection trend, but also met certain characteristics of numerical numbers in isolation that surge testing might have an impact over a short period of time.
So our goal, in those communities, is to do at least 5,000 tests per day.  And those are in Baton Rouge, Jacksonville, and McAllen — the McAllen in Texas.  And we have many other sites that we’re working with.  Again, this is a partnership with the state and local governments to make that happen.  They’re up and running and testing in all three sites.  Baton Rouge started yesterday, the other two sites start today, and we already have almost 6,500 appointments already made this morning.  So that’s going very, very well.
The last thing I wanted to talk about is Phoenix.  And I don’t know if we have the slides for this.  I get just a little bit concerned when I hear things in the news, like “we’re doing nothing for Phoenix” and “the federal government hasn’t been doing anything with Phoenix.”  Because that really is not correct, and it undermines a lot of the things that we’re doing.
I’m going to show you some slides.  I didn’t make these slides up.  My team — this was part of a 55-slide deck — 55-slides slide deck just on Phoenix, where we understand the demographics, the health disparities, the income levels, the racial and ethnicity backgrounds, where the tests are done, where the resources are.  This is how we really work the issues.
So, first of all, we’re in constant contact with Governor Ducey and his team.  His state health officials are outstanding.  We not only talk on the calls, but we have frequent calls.  And I know Dr. Redfield does this as well, and Ambassador Birx does this as well.
Number two, we provide support according to the state plans.  Just in the last two months, we’ve shipped over 500,000 swabs and media to the state to fulfill their plans.
In terms of Phoenix — if I can get the first slide back, please — I just want to say that, yes, we have lots of support in Phoenix.  This is the community-based testing locations.  I didn’t decode this because it’s right out of my slide deck.  Phoenix has three federally funded retail sites.  This is paid on a per-capita basis.  You come up and get a test.  These sites — not these three sites, but this overall program has tested just under a million individuals, and they’re located specifically in communities of high social vulnerability.  We have three there.
We also have 13 — what we call “3.0 sites.”  These are retail pharmacies that, because of our regulatory flexibility, they can do that without a federal stipend or grant.  They do this just through the insurance Medicare and Medicaid billing system.  So, those are 16 federal sites we have in Phoenix.
Next slide.
I don’t know if there’s a map to go with that, but under the leadership of Secretary Azar, we’ve really surged into FQHCs — Federally Qualified Health Centers.  This is where you really want testing to happen because these are medical homes for those who are indigent and underserved.  We have 28 FQHCs sites performing testing just in the Phoenix area right now.
Next slide.
We don’t have that slide, but let me talk about — we’ve also identified every single testing machine in Phoenix.  So there are testing machines to do tens of thousands of tests per day.  And we’re sending at least 100,000 — okay, maybe it’ll come up, maybe it won’t, but at least 100,000 assays to the Phoenix area every week.
So these are all the things we’re doing in the background, that happen on a regular basis, that we do community by community by community.
Now, two days ago, I heard that Mayor Gallego was unhappy because there was no federal support.  I heard that on Monday — on Monday morning.  I was on the phone with the FEMA representative in the afternoon.  It was clear to me that Phoenix was not in tune with all the things that the state were doing.  We convened a call last night, where we had Governor Ducey’s people on the phone, where we had the mayor’s people on the phone, where we had various health officials on the phone.  We got everybody together, understood where the gaps are.  There’s a surge from Arizona State.  There are a surge in testing sites that are state testing sites in Phoenix that are up there.
And this morning, Governor Ducey looked at everything, thought a surge site would be helpful in west Phoenix.  He requested that, and we’re contracting that right now.
So I just wanted to give you that example because it really pains me when somebody says the federal government isn’t doing anything, when we have 41 federal sites there.  We’re sending supplies, we’re sending tests.  And we work with the governor every day.  And if there’s an appropriate request and it’s on the list for Dr. Birx, which it was, we will send a surge site.  And that’s what we’re doing; we’re contracting that this afternoon.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good job, Brett.  Thank you, Admiral Giroir.
As we said, the focus today is on safely reopening our schools.  And as we discussed yesterday at the White House summit, from very early in this process, the Centers for Disease Control has been issuing guidance for schools and for childcare services, in early March — March the 12th, to be specific.  And when we first published the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” and encouraged people to engage in schooling from home, wherever possible, from that point forward, CDC has published decision trees about how schools can begin to develop reopening plans, and just last week, published new guidance for K-12 schools.
But next week, as Dr. Redfield can elaborate in a few moments, they’ll be issuing five new documents that’ll range from preparing communities to return to school safely, to decision-making tools for parents and caregivers, and to create symptom screening considerations as children and teachers return to school.
But as we made clear yesterday, we’ll make clear again today: We’re here to help.  And none of the CDC’s recommendations are intended to replace state and local rules and guidance; that what we’ve made clear to governors and to state and local health officials is CDC stands ready to work with local officials as they tailor their plan for reopening their schools.  But we’re all committed to getting our kids back in the classroom and getting them back in the classroom this fall.
With that, I want the Secretary of Education to reflect on the efforts she’s making here at the Department of Education, then we’ll hear from Dr. Redfield, and then a few wrap-up comments from Secretary of HHS before we go to questions.
Madam Secretary?
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thanks, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President.  Thanks for hosting the task force here today.  We are so grateful to the President and to you for your leadership on doing what’s right for students.
Yesterday we had a really good and important conversation at the White House with local leaders and great teachers and parents.  It was insightful and inspiring.  And as Mrs. Pence noted, these past few months, parents have worn multiple hats.  They really are our unsung heroes, and I might add, as the Vice President noted, as are the teachers who were often playing dual roles as parents themselves and continuing to help their students learn.
She also said — Mrs. Pence also said that as we reopen businesses, restaurants, theaters in our country, we simply can’t leave out our schools, and that is so correct.  Students can and must continue to learn full-time.
I’ve been really inspired by the innovative teachers, schools, and their communities that have kept learning going through this past few months, and they’re getting ready to do it again this fall.
A couple of great examples in Harlem and the surrounding boroughs in New York: Success Academy moved to distance learning in one week, using multiple technology platforms.  Teachers there insisted on learning new materials, right along with their students.  The students were still graded.  They made sure all the students had the needed tech that they did not maybe have at home, initially.
Miami-Dade County used its existing instructional continuity plans to make a seamless transition to distance learning.  They added interventions for students who were struggling already before the pandemic.
The International Leadership Academy in Texas started from the mindset that not learning wasn’t an option for any student.  They delivered multilingual and special education curriculum to all of their students.  There were a number of schools and districts across the country that did an awesome job of transitioning this spring.  And there were a lot in which I and state school leaders were disappointed in that they didn’t figure out how to continue to serve their students.  Too many of them just gave up.
The Center for Reinventing Public Education said that only 10 percent across the board provided any kind of real curriculum and instruction program.
And, as I said, I’ve talked to all of the state school chiefs at least once, most of them more than once, and they’ve told me that while many of their districts in their states have done well through the past several months, a number of them, they were very disappointed in, in doing next to nothing.
And then we see as we talk about reopening schools, there are some creating false paradigms for the fall.  And here, right in our neighborhood, the D.C. area, Fairfax County, which is one of the most well-funded — I would call it an elite public school system in America — offered families a so-called “choice” for this fall: either zero days in school for their students or two days.  And their springtime attempt at distance learning was a disaster.  I have to — I give this as an example because things like this cannot happen again in the fall.  It would fail America’s students, and it would fail taxpayers who pay high taxes for their education.
Ultimately, it’s not a matter of “if” schools should reopen, it’s simply a matter of “how.”  They must fully open, and they must be fully operational.  And how that happens is best left to education and community leaders.
I really appreciate something that Secretary Azar reiterated yesterday at the White House.  It’s the Surgeon General’s prescription for healthcare, and I’m going to repeat it again because it bears repeating:
First, ask yourself what’s your individual circumstance.  Are you or is someone in your home vulnerable?  Second, what’s going on in your community?  Is the virus widespread or is it isolated?  And third, think about the kind of school activity that you’re talking — that you’re thinking about how to — how to accommodate and deal with.
What needs to be in place for things to be successful: Education leaders need to examine real data for their own states and communities and weigh the risks.  Local leaders in every community need to ask these questions and consider all the risks.  Physical health and safety are factors — so is mental health; so is social emotional development; and importantly, very importantly, so are lost opportunities for students, particularly the most vulnerable among us and students with disabilities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics noted: Keeping schools closed “places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.”  The Pediatrics guidance concluded that everyone “should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.”  “Fully open” and “fully operational” means that students need a full school year or more, and it’s expected it will look different depending on where you are.
What’s clear is that students and their families need more options.  I’ve talked a long time about the need to rethink education and the — to expand education options for all students.  This moment really demands action, and America always was, and is, and always will be a country of doers.
We are confident that with grit and determination and a measure of grace, we can and will do what’s right for all the students in our nation.  Thanks very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  First and foremost, I want to make it very, very clear that the guidance that CDC continues to put out for schools K-12 and higher learning is intentional for reopening and keeping our schools open.  That’s its purpose.  We recognize that there’s a variety of unique circumstances for different schools and different school districts, and so we’ve outlined a number of strategies that those schools, those administrators can use to accomplish this goal safely.
But I want to make it very clear that what is not the intent of CDC’s guidelines is to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed.  We’re prepared to work with each school, each jurisdiction to help them use the different strategies that we propose that help do this safely so they come up with the optimal strategy for those schools.
I think it’s critical — and it would be, personally, very disappointing to me and, I know, my agency — if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools.
I think there’s a series of different additional guidelines that we are about to put out to help, really, with the K-12 community, particularly at the community level, to help open safely.  Guidelines also that come out were consideration documents for parents and caregivers; guidelines for schools to help them understand how best to do symptom surveillance and characterize symptoms in the schools as a tool; and guidelines to really work out how — and the ins and outs of using face mask in the school setting; as well as, finally, some guidance and to help the schools have systems which they can monitor their programs.
But I want to close by just reiterating again: The purpose of CDC’s guidance is — remember, it’s guidance; it’s not requirements — and its purpose is to facilitate the reopening and the keeping open the schools in this country.  Because as the Vice President said, it is critical that we get these schools open and do it safely.  We’re prepared to work with all the school districts and schools to help them facilitate their development of their own unique plan to accomplish that.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Dr. Redfield.  Opening up schools is the right thing to do for our kids so they don’t fall behind academically and also so that children that are in need of services — special-needs children, children with mental health issues, nutrition needs — have the support that they receive at the schools.
It’s important, though, for parents and for working families.  And we — I asked Secretary Scalia to be here from the Department of Labor to speak about the impact on — as we put America back to work, making it possible for us to have single parents back in the workforce, it’s essential that we get our schools open as well.
And so I wanted Secretary Scalia, and then of course Secretary of HHS, to finish our remarks before we go to questions.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY SCALIA:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  It’s good to be with you all today.  For reasons that Secretary DeVos has mentioned and that the Vice President mentioned, of course, having our schools open is so important to our children’s education.  But as the Vice President has said, it’s very important as well to working men and women across the country who need to be able to structure their workdays in a predictable manner.   And the expectation that schools will be open and their children will be able to be in school so that the parents, in turn, can have a predictable schedule that they bring to the workplace, of course, that’s important to our business places as well.  And in that sense, it’s really critically important to our national reopening.
One study has suggested that if we closed all our schools and daycare for just a month — just, hypothetically, if we did that — the impact on U.S. productivity would be in the order of $50 billion.  That gives you some sense of the impact having our schools closed can have on our national recovery.
I did want to mention a couple of groups in particular to whom this is very important.  First: lower-wage workers.  One of the great triumphs of the economy that we enjoyed until the virus came was how well lower-income men and women were doing in the workplace.  We, as you know, had unemployment that tied a 50-year low.  We had record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and others.  And we had rising wages; wages actually rose about 15 percent for lower-income men and women during the first three years of this administration.
Unfortunately — and a number of people have observed this — it’s the lower-income workers who’ve been particularly adversely affected by some of the shutdowns that we’ve had in response to the coronavirus.
Unemployment among the lower-income workers has been higher than for other populations.  And therefore, for them, having schools reopen so that they can themselves have predictable schedules, be able to return to the workplace, is going to be very important.  They hold jobs that are less likely be jobs by which you can telecommute.  I think many of us know that, even telecommuting, there are burdens being placed on mothers, fathers who are getting up a little bit earlier or staying up a lot later to get work done, to plan around caring for their children in the interim.  But for lower-income men and women, that option often is not even available.
And then, second, let me comment briefly on working women, who — studies show and I think the experience of many of us reflects that it’s women in the household who quite often bear the larger burden when it comes to caring for children.  Studies show this.  And again, prior to COVID, another great success of the economy we were enjoying was the employment rate for women.  The unemployment rate for women was actually lower than for men, right before the virus came.  But unfortunately — and this is a statistic we’ve been tracking — we see that the unemployment rate for women now is higher than it is for men.
Now, we made great progress in June.  The Vice President mentioned the extraordinary jobs report.  We’ve put seven and a half million Americans back to work in just two months, and the unemployment rate for women dropped nearly 3 percent in June.
But still, we have important work to do, and we know that working women will have a harder time getting back to the workplace.  They continue to cite childcare at a much higher rate than men do as a reason that they’re not able to work.  And so for them, too, reopening our schools will be very important.
Look, just to wrap up — and it’s such an important sense the pace and structure of our national life is built around the expectation that our young people will be in school, in person, during the school year.  That’s so important for them, but it’s also vitally important for their parents, and in that sense, so critical to this reopening that is proceeding very well, economically.  But to keep going, we need our schools open in the fall.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Gene.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the President’s all-of-America approach to combatting the virus and for the focus that you’re now putting on getting our kids safely back to school.
From HHS’s perspective, reopening schools safely may be the single-most important thing that we can do to support healthy families during this pandemic.  All decisions about undertaking activities during COVID-19 have to look at risk as a continuum, not a binary question.  States and school districts can think about the same things that we urge individuals to think about.
As Secretary DeVos noted, our Surgeon General has come out with his “prescription for health.”  Ask yourself three critical questions: Where are you?  Is there significant community transmission of the virus in your area?  Whom are we talking about?  Children are much less susceptible to severe outcomes from the virus than adults.  And what activities are we looking at?
There are more and less risky activities for schools, like keeping kids in the same classroom versus changing classes, avoiding large gatherings, and doing activities outside whenever possible.  Reopening schools comes with some risk, but there are risks to keeping kids at home too.
At home, kids aren’t benefitting from social stimulation.  They may be falling behind with learning.  They may be more vulnerable to abuse that goes unreported by the mandatory reporters in our school system.  They may not be getting special services they may need.  They may not be getting the nutrition that they get at school.  And it may be difficult for parents to get back to work, as Secretary Scalia noted.
This issue, like so many considerations around safely reopening, isn’t about health versus the economy, but about health versus health.  All of this is why the American Academy of Pediatrics has strongly recommended beginning with the goal of having students physically present in school.  This goal is the right way to use the extensive guidance that CDC has put out to help each state and school district think through a safe reopening.
Last week, we put out guidance around testing for K-through-12 schools.  This guidance, like our guidance for colleges and universities, offers recommendations for how and when students, teachers, and staff should be tested.
While CDC does not make a recommendation in favor of universal testing, it’s a perfectly appropriate surveillance technique where the capacity exists, and capacity is growing all the time.  We’ve talked with colleges and universities that are able to use their research lab capacity with pooling of multiple samples to test their whole student bodies and staff frequently, thanks to regulatory flexibility that CMS and the FDA have provided.
Many of the leaders we heard from yesterday at the White House School Reopening Summit are doing testing before returning to school, and then sentinel surveillance.
On top of that, the measures we recommend universally — like keeping a distance, wearing a face covering, and frequent hand washing — are effective and can be applied in the college or the K-through-12 setting.
We put out the CDC guidance to enable and support states and school districts in reopening safely.  We want them to use the tools available to reduce risk, and we’ll be putting out more guidance on how schools can use each of these tools, such as face coverings.
On top of that, I will reiterate that our set of tools is expanding all of the time.  Just yesterday, we signed a new agreement with Regeneron to provide nearly half a billion dollars in support for a promising therapeutic, all the way to manufacturing hundreds of thousands of doses for the American people.  The initial doses, pending approval, would be available as soon as the end of this summer or early fall.  That is the first of a number of therapeutic agreements that we will do under the President’s Operation Warp Speed initiative.
Promising therapeutics are already being administered every day by our heroic healthcare workers.  I want to thank these heroes who continue to put themselves at risk, caring for those suffering from the virus.  We know many frontline workers have gotten sick, and we know some have given their lives, including some of my employees in the Indian Health Service, and America is deeply grateful.
It is because we are making progress against the virus and learning more about it every day that we can talk about how to bring America’s kids and teachers back to school safely.  We have the tools to do it, and it has to be a top priority.
So thank you to President Trump and the Vice President for putting such a focus on this very important aspect of our road to recovery.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.

1:29 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  All right.  Hello, everyone.  Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future.  The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities.  President Trump said, “After all, what do we want?  We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order.”  He went on to say, “We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities.  And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world.”  He went on to say, “We should all want the same thing.  How can it be any different than those things?”
This message is now more important and more timely than ever.  Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials — everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi.  Misguided movements, such as “Defund the Police,” seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever.  Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country.  An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families.  Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, “Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential.  Never forget: We are one family and one nation…We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so…they can build its future.”
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it’s an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

University of South Florida
Tampa, Florida
3:38 P.M. EDT
GOVERNOR DESANTIS:  Well, I want to thank the Vice President.  I want to thank Secretary Azar, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Birx for coming down to Florida, and also just for all the help that they provided throughout these many months.
You know, we are now in a situation where we are testing a lot more.  We also have a greater percentage of people testing positive.  I mean, throughout May and early June here in Hillsborough County, for example, I think they were testing at about 3 or 4 percent would test positive.  Now, we’re looking at places like Hillsborough and in Orange County, no longer 3, 4 percent but now 15 percent of folks are testing positive.  Obviously when you’re testing about 60,000 people a day — we’re getting results like that over the last week — that’s going to generate a lot of additional cases.
So we were discussing some of the things that we may be able to do going forward, including pooling, types of testing in conjunction with our universities — which I think will be really, really good.  We also spoke with some of the hospital systems here — Tampa General, BayCare — about other ways that we could be helpful.
You know, one of the things — if you go back to March when we, kind of, faced the initial wave of this, I mean, we had very few tests relative to what we have now.  Now hospitals test — anyone that comes in for something, they can test.  You know, we, between the state, we’re doing 10 to 15 thousand tests a day at all the different sites.
There was a question about PPE.  We’ve got PPE; hospitals have it, the state has it.  You know, we’re good to go there.  There was no treatment of any kind, really, for this.  It was totally novel.  The physicians have learned a lot.
And then, through Secretary Azar and HHS — I remember coming down, I think at the end of April, to visit Tampa General.  They asked about remdesivir.  We called Secretary Azar; they’ve been sending a bunch of the remdesivir down.  So the physicians are using that.  They’re using convalescent plasma.  And they are having definitely better results.
And then we also — even though we took a lot of action early to protect the long-term care facilities — since March, we have increasingly brought on COVID-only dedicated nursing facilities.  And so we now have 12 of these facilities throughout the state of Florida.  We have one in Pinellas, one in Polk, which the Tampa Bay hospitals can use and nursing homes can use.
And basically, the idea is: If you have somebody test positive in a nursing home, you don’t want that to spread to the other residents.  That individual is medically stable; they can be transferred to the COVID-only facility.  If they need hospitalization, obviously they go to the hospital.  But if they end up becoming stable while in the hospital, rather than be discharged back to that facility, which would create problems, you have a place to go to be able to discharge that.
So all around the state now we’ve got 750 beds in COVID-only nursing facilities.  And so we just brought one on in Miami.  We now have one in Broward, two in Palm Beach, two in southwest Florida, Brevard County, Jacksonville, Escambia, and Tallahassee.
So, pretty much anywhere around the state, if you have somebody who is a resident of a long-term care facility, that’s in the hospital, that’s medically stable but still contagious, you have a place where they can be safely transferred.  So we think that that’s something that’s very, very significant.
The message that we’ve really been sending for folks in Florida: I think because we had such a quiet May — because, you know, the positivity was so low, the caseload was so low — it kind of fell out of the news at the end of May, beginning of June, and I think people weren’t as focused on it anymore.  And now, obviously we’ve seen these cases.  So I think people are more focused on it.
But basically, the message is, you know, for those folks who are 65 and older, people that have significant underlying medical conditions, you know, do your best to avoid crowds and minimize close contact with people outside your home right now.
We have the virus community transmission, particularly with younger people.  If you look at where — you go back a month, the median age of our cases was in the 50s.  Now the median age of the cases here in Hillsborough County for the entire pandemic has dropped to 34.  And there’ll be days where we’ll get cases in Hillsborough County and the median age will be under 30.  In Orange County, the median age for the whole pandemic is now 32.  There’s days where it’ll be 28 and 29.  So it’s been a huge shift.
The case growth has really been in that 18 to 34, 35 age group.  Now, those are folks that are, by and large, going to be much less prone to significant consequences.  Nevertheless, with the increasing positivity rate, it’s clear that you’re seeing more and more community transmission really being driven by that age group.
And so if you’re someone in one of the medically vulnerable conditions or you’re an older person, you know, just understand that that’s out there, continue to be vigilant.  I think folks in Florida — the seniors — have been very, very vigilant throughout this whole time.  We still want to ask people to be able to do that going forward.
And then for, kind of, the general public, you know, we’re telling people to avoid the three Cs: you know, closed spaces.  In Florida, it’s hot.  People don’t want to be outside in 95-degree heat.  Just understand, if you’re getting together in closed spaces with poor ventilation, that is going to be a much better vector for this virus to be able to spread.
We’re also saying avoid large crowds.  Now, we had for a long time a 10-person gathering limit.  We’ve advised, you know, not to do more than 50.  But I would say the smaller the group, the better for that.
And then also, the close contact.  If you’re in really close, sustained contact with somebody, you’re going to be more apt to see transmission of this virus.
So avoid the three Cs.  Stay safe and take care of yourself during this holiday weekend.
I want to bring up the Vice President just to thank him.  He came down, I remember, at the very beginning of this in March.  We went down and met with the cruise line folks.  He’s always been there to help us as we’ve needed different things, and, you know, we have needed things from time to time.  And so I really want to thank him for being a friend to the state of Florida, being a friend to the people of Florida, and really never leaving this fight.
I mean, even as we saw numbers go down across the country in May, you know, now we see a Sun Belt resurgence, and he’s been, I think, all over the Sun Belt just in the last few days.  So we’ve already discussed ways that they can help Florida going forward, and I know that they’re going to be able to deliver on that.
So I want to — it’s my, really, honor to be able to welcome yet again to the state of Florida, our Vice President Mike Pence.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Governor DeSantis.  Thank you for your leadership.  The people of Florida deserve to know that from the very beginning of this pandemic, Governor DeSantis and his healthcare team have formed a seamless partnership with our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force.
And whether it be in testing, whether it be in personal protective equipment, whether it be in the distribution of therapeutics like remdesivir, or whether it be in advancing the kind of mitigation efforts that have kept Florida low for a long time until just a few short weeks ago — Governor, I want to thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and your partnership.
And I want to thank all the people of Florida for all of your efforts over the many months, and to say to each and every one of you, what we said to the Governor today is: We’re with you.  And at President Trump’s direction, we’re going to make sure that your governor and the state of Florida have what you need, when you need it, to meet this moment of rising cases across the state.
We really are here to assure the people of Florida that, as we — as we see the rising cases not only in this state but across the Sun Belt, that we’re going to do whatever it takes to make sure that our extraordinary healthcare workers have the resources and the support and supplies.
The Governor and I talked today about personnel, and we’ll be considering a request from the state of Florida about medical personnel that we’ll be processing in very short order.
But, Governor, I also want to thank you for your efforts.  I want to thank you for your efforts to open up Florida again.  We had good news this morning as a nation: Nearly 5 million jobs created in the month of June, including many here in the state of Florida.  It was the largest one-month increase in history.  And Florida, being an economic engine for the United States, played a key role in that.
But I also want to say, Governor, that we fully support your prudent steps in working to slow the spread and the rise in cases that are impacting Florida today.
As we said at a task force meeting not long ago, it’s — and I’d say to the people of Florida: It’s not an either/or choice.  If all of us will put into practice the guidance from state and local officials — which is wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask when it’s indicated by local officials, or wear a mask when you can social distance — we know that we can do what Florida did for those many months and what other impacted areas around the country did.  We can slow the spread.  We can flatten the curve.  But it’ll take all of us to do it.  And I just want to reassure you, Governor, that we’re going to be working with you to make sure that Florida has all the resources.
The economic comeback that’s underway is a — is a demonstration that we don’t have to choose between opening up America and the health of our people.  We can do both.  And that’s the challenge that we face today across the Sun Belt.
And we just want to encourage, with great respect, all Floridians to put these principles into practice and know that we’re going to stay with you every step of the way.
I do want to say that we’re encouraged today to hear a report from the Governor that, particularly in the category of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, that Florida’s hospitals are in good shape.  We also are pleased to hear the hospital capacity remains strong in this state.
We’re informed there’s about more than 13,000 total hospital beds available at this time.  Availability, 22 percent of hospital capacity.  Ventilators, which were an issue before our nation four months ago, at the beginning of this pandemic, are in abundant supply.  We’re told that there’s more than 5,500 ventilators available across the state of Florida.
And at President Trump’s direction, we worked with companies across the country.  We’re well on our way to manufacturing 100,000 ventilators in 100 days, and in just a matter of the next two weeks, we’ll have 50,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile.  And should the need arise anywhere here in Florida, we want to assure you, Governor, and all your healthcare workers that the resources will be there.
We’re also encouraged to hear that personal protective equipment remains in abundant supply in the state.  The federal government has shipped literally millions of N95 masks, surgical masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves, but we’ll continue to make sure that those resources flow to the great healthcare systems that we had the opportunity to meet with today.
As you’ll hear in a moment, too, from the director of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, we’re also making steady progress in distributing therapeutics, or medicines, to treat people that are suffering the symptoms of the coronavirus.  And I’m pleased to report to your governor today that, just yesterday, the latest shipment of remdesivir arrived in Florida — 34,000 vials of remdesivir that’s — that will literally treat thousands of patients in this state.
That, combined with other innovative treatments like steroids and convalescent plasma, we literally are — we’re in a much better place than even two months ago to be able to treat people who have contracted the coronavirus.
And I hope that — I hope that that message, more than anything else, comes through today to the people of Florida — is to understand that we are, because of all we’ve done as a country, because of President Trump’s leadership in standing up a whole-of-America approach — manufacturing supplies, innovating in testing, developing therapeutics, and well on our way to developing a vaccine — we hope and trust, perhaps even by the end of this year, that we are in a much better place to confront the rising cases that are impacting here in Florida and all across the country.
And so I want people to be vigilant, but we want people to be encouraged that we’re going to make sure your governor and the state of Florida has everything you need to meet this moment and do what Florida has been doing from the very beginning, and that is putting the health of the people of this state first.
And let me also say, with great admiration to the people of Florida, that the record of Florida in protecting the most vulnerable is among the best in the nation.  And, Governor, your steps — your steps to protect residents of long-term care, to create those COVID-only facilities, to do the kind of testing that’s — the record in Florida really speaks for itself.  And we commend you for that, and we’ll continue to support your efforts.
Governor, President Trump and I are absolutely committed to supporting your efforts to respond to this outbreak in Florida, to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable, to get our kids back to school, and to keep opening up our economy.
But lastly, let me say to all my fellow Americans all across Florida: We all need to do our part, and we once again want to specifically encourage younger Americans in Florida.  It’s one of the unique things — I was in Arizona yesterday, I was in Texas over the weekend, and as we discussed with your governor, it’s a truism of this moment in the pandemic that some 50 percent of all the new cases are Americans under the age of 35.
And to each and every one of you, let me just say from my heart: I know you know that without a serious underlying health condition, that the threat of the coronavirus to younger Americans is very, very low.  But no younger American would ever want to put at risk a grandmother, a grandfather, a mom, a dad, an elderly neighbor, or a friend by inadvertently exposing them to the coronavirus.
And that’s why we encourage you to be vigilant, to heed state and local guidance, and to respect those who are most vulnerable, in particular.  And just know that if all of us do our part, we’ll get through this.
I can’t help but feel that the resilience and the strength and the character of the American people shown forth today, that even in these challenging times, we’re continuing to see America’s economy coming back and America going back to work.
And I’m just absolutely confident, if all of us do all that we need to do, we’ll do what we’ve done before in other parts of the country and what Florida did for so many months: We will slow the spread, we will flatten the curve, we will save lives, and we will bring Florida and America’s economy back bigger and better than ever before.
With that, I’m going to invite to the podium a couple of members of our team.  Dr. Deborah Birx has been the White House coordinator, been our lead scientist on all matters.  And after her, we’ll hear from the Secretary of HHS briefly, and the head of the FDA, to share with you what we heard today and what we’re seeing.
But, Governor, once again, thank you for your leadership.  And to all the people of Florida: We’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you until that day comes that we put the coronavirus in the past here in Florida and all across America.
Thank you and God bless you.
Deb?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  It’s a pleasure to be here with all of you today.  And I want to start where the Vice President left off: that we all have a critical role to play in the next few weeks.
We were watching this area, Tampa, very closely — through March, through April, through May, through your reopening.  And for days after days, weeks after weeks, we saw you sitting at 4 percent, which everybody, including the World Health Organization, said is a safe place to be.
At end of May, we began to see your numbers increase and go from a very low of 4 percent at the end of May to this high now of 17 percent.  So this virus came to Tampa and spread through Tampa sometime along the end of May, and then spread through the asymptomatic groups that don’t, as described, get symptoms and constantly spread, and to the point where you have this number of cases today.  And we all have a critical role to play over the next two to three weeks to stop that spread.
To every Floridian: We know what works, in addition to the hand washing and the social distancing, wearing masks, and not having large gatherings inside, not having large gathering outside.  But if you participated in a large gathering in the last four weeks, we ask all of you to come forward and be tested because of the level of asymptomatic spread.
So we’re asking for everyone under 40 that, if you were in a gathering, please go and get tested.  Please wear a mask.  Please do all of the hygiene issues.  And please stay away from those who have comorbidities.
Of course, the governors and mayors are all acting together to really extend and stay safe for everybody in Florida.  But also, the federal government has a role, and that’s why it was exciting to be here today to talk to the University of South Florida and your brilliant scientists and physicians here to really start to implement pooled testing.  That is our breakthrough that we’ve been working on for three weeks.
We think that Florida and this university and this particular county is a great place to start.  How can that be utilized?  It can be utilized three ways.  One way is going into neighborhoods and testing whole families into a single tube.  And then if anybody is positive, you would go back, use your contact tracing to test everyone in the household.
It is easy for them to test themselves by just the front of their nose into the transport media, coming back here, working with your research community to run those tests, going back then and testing the positive households and ensuring those that are positive remain quarantined and isolated for the next couple of weeks.
It’s the role for the federal government to support that enhanced testing.  FDA has put out new guidelines to encourage it.  We have put guidelines up on the White House website.  They’ve been there for three or four weeks, but we really need to act on them and have a partnership, like here today, bringing together community with scientists and the medical field to really take that next step.
That can also be used in screening large numbers of school students, because you can put 10 into one tube.  So you can do a classroom with retest.
This is groundbreaking for putting people back to school and keeping universities open, where you could test an entire dorm probably with 10 to 15 tests, always with the ability to go back and do individual diagnostic tests for the pools that are positive.
We think that this is a critical breakthrough.  As the FDA continues to bring new testing online, this would allow us to go from 5,000 tests a day to 50,000 tests a day.  And for in Florida, that would be a log increase that we could support and continue, and we want to encourage that but we want to work alongside you.
And as the Vice President said, of course we are here to support your medical community — and you’ll hear from Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar — but we’re here also as the federal government so that you know that you have our continuous support.
There are things that we have to do together as individuals that established this great nation.  It’s a privilege to wear red, white, and blue today.  I don’t often get — you only get to do that a couple of times a year, so it’s a privilege to be here celebrating the birth of our country and asking each American citizen, particularly Floridians, to do the responsible thing of wearing a mask, protecting others.
And we, as a state and local, and federal government, will walk beside you and help with all of those innovations to bring us to a different place — lower those cases and stop the spread.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, Governor DeSantis, thank you for having us here and for welcoming us again to Florida and for being here in Tampa.  Boy, I learned a lot.  I learned a lot from the University of South Florida and Tampa General.  Got a long list of actions coming out of this really tremendous session that we get so much value from.
And thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of our all-of-America approach to defeating this virus.
I want to begin by thanking the healthcare workers and also the members of the HHS team that are working here in Florida and across the country to beat this virus.  They put themselves in harm’s way every day to help their fellow citizens, and we owe them all a deep debt of gratitude.
Thanks to the President and the Vice President’s leadership over the past several months, we at HHS and across the administration have built a six-point, all-of-America strategy to protect our country from the virus and, in time, defeat it.  And in each of these domains, as the Vice President said, we have advanced dramatically over just the last two months.  That’s surveillance, testing, containment, healthcare system resilience, therapeutics, and vaccines.
Here in Florida, thanks to the strong work by the state, we now have far more ability to track the spread of the virus than ever before.  We know that cases are rising quickly in parts of the state, but with the right data, as Dr. Birx said, we can target our approach and respond.
To support testing and containment, this week, CDC put out guidance around testing for higher education, as well as for K-through-12 students.
On therapeutics, we’ve distributed nearly 7,000 remdesivir treatment courses to Florida.  And this week, the President secured access to another 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir over the next three months, which will be allocated based on data that we continue to collect about the virus.
We’ve put out treatment guidelines for the use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids.  And we’re seeing promising data on the use of convalescent plasma, in terms — in the treatment of tens of thousands of patients.  These are three therapeutics that likely have already saved thousands of lives.
On vaccines: This week, the FDA put out guidance to accelerate progress toward a safe and effective vaccine.  Before a vaccine is ready, we’ll be working with states like Florida to plan for what distribution will look like.
Now, individuals will have a key role to play in our strategy.  You can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community by assessing the risks that you face.  Just think about three questions: First, who am I and whom do I live with?  Do age or underlying conditions put me at a higher risk?  Second, where am I?  Is the virus spreading where I live, and what are the recommendations of state and local authorities where I am?  And third, what am I thinking about doing?  Going to a crowded indoor place is riskier than an outdoor activity.
Practice physical distancing.  When you can’t keep a distance, wear a cloth face covering.  Always practice good hygiene, including hand washing.  These simple steps will make it much easier for us as a country to defeat the virus together.
So thank you all very much for being here, but thank you for everything that the people of Florida are doing not just to protect yourself and those you live with, but if you’re young, as was said earlier by the Vice President, you know the risk to you are quite low.  But you’re protecting vulnerable people in your household.  You’re also protecting the stranger standing next to you in the grocery store line, and you don’t know if that person is vulnerable, and you don’t want that on your conscience.
Practice social distancing, wear face covering, and practice good personal hygiene.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Stephen?
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the coronavirus task force.  It’s really been remarkable.  And, Governor, just, again, a remarkable effort, particularly protecting seniors in your state.
So I came to the job as FDA Commissioner after being a cancer doctor for over 30 years.  And I know the power of hope, but I also know that false hope can be damaging.  And what I saw today, the partnership of Tampa General and University of South Florida, gives me great hope.
What I saw was a partnership that developed a care plan that really accelerated and advanced the care of the patients with COVID-19 — something that we’re seeing across the country.  That is something that gives me great hope for Americans who might be afflicted with COVID-19.
President Trump asked the FDA to reduce regulatory barriers to getting medical products out to Americans during this time of a public health emergency.  And we set up something called the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.  And what we’ve seen over the last several months is just the incredible American biomedical research engine go forth.  We now have a number of therapies that are available for patients, and that also gives me great hope.
We have remdesivir, that’s been mentioned, which has been shown to reduce the stay of hospitalization in sick COVID-19 patients.
We’ve seen a trial that’s shown us that corticosteroids, dexamethasone, and others have the potential for reducing mortality by 30 percent in sick hospitalized patients.  And that has been mentioned here.  We have convalescent plasma, and convalescent plasma, of course, has been used for years for patients who’ve had infectious diseases, where you take the liquid protein portion of a blood that has the immunity, the natural immunity from someone who’s recovered from COVID-19, and you give that to someone who’s sick.
We’ve seen some early encouraging results in 20,000 patients that’s been shown to be safe.  And we have more than 28,000 patients in the U.S. who’ve been treated with convalescent plasma.  And we’ll get some relatively — we’ll get some news relatively soon on the data on the effectiveness of this.
But one thing I want to tell Americans: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, you should contact your local blood bank, the American Red Cross, because this could be lifesaving for someone with COVID-19, and it would be great for you to go and to donate and provide that opportunity to someone who’s afflicted with the disease.
Just a moment to tell you about other things: There are 141 clinical trials that are currently ongoing and overseen by the FDA.  There are more than 300 applications for therapeutics at the FDA right now.  So, again, this great American biomedical research engine continues; the pipeline is robust.
A little bit about vaccines: I want to congratulate Secretary Azar and his incredible leadership of the Operation Warp Speed.  In addition to Operation Warp Speed, there are a number of other vaccine manufacturers around the world that have vaccines that are in development.  We’ve authorized to proceed in clinical trial four vaccines, another six manufacturers are with us with applications, and another a dozen or more are actually talking to us about vaccines.
So in, record time, from identification of this virus, which we have to remember occurred in January, we have a vaccine that now is in the middle stages of clinical trials, and we expect two of have them to be in the later stages of trials — phase three trials in July.
As was mentioned, we did issue guidance with respect to vaccine development.  And one thing I want to assure the American people is that your FDA is on the job.  We will not cut corners in our assessment to the vaccine.  Our solemn promise to the American people is that we will look at the data associated with the vaccine, and we will make a decision about the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine using our typical high standards.
And so we all want, urgently, a vaccine.  I think we’re making really good progress.  I am cautiously optimistic, but FDA will be on the job, with respect to assessing its safety and efficacy.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Questions for me, any member of our team, or the Governor?  I think we’ve got a little bit of time.  Anyone?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-governor-desantis-florida-members-coronavirus-task-force-tampa-fl/

4:43 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  So I am pleased to inform everyone that Seattle has been liberated.  The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, otherwise known as “CHAZ” — I think they switched their name to “CHOP,” but I’m told they went back to “CHAZ” — was a failed four-week Democrat experiment by the radical left.  And the results are in: Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured. 
     While the Democrat mayor of Seattle proclaimed that CHAZ was to be, quote, “the summer of love,” in fact, it was not.  And other failed Democrat politicians also remained passive, or even silent, in the face of anarchy.  But while that happened, President Trump set the tone: Law and order must prevail to preserve peace in our streets. 
     The President is not the Democrat governor of the state of Washington.  The President is not the Democrat mayor of Seattle.  But, nevertheless, the President must lead by example and be prepared to act in the face of failed Democrat leadership, which is what we saw in Democrat Seattle and Democrat Wisconsin.
     President Trump has always stood on the side of law and order, and we are pleased to report that law and order has prevailed, and Seattle has been liberated from the anarchists.
     In President Trump’s America, autonomous zones will have no sanctuary.  The BHAZ, B-H-A-Z — which stood for the Black House Autonomous Zone, across from the White House — was swiftly dismantled.  One hundred anarchists were arrested for rioting and destruction of federal property here in D.C; I believe that number is now above 300.  Four men have been charged in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  And there are 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. 
     You contrast the President’s vision of law and order to that of the failed CHAZ experiments and anarchy, and here’s what you find in the failed Democratic experiment that took place out in Seattle: The Seattle Times said the shooting at Seattle’s CHOP protest tragically killed a 16-year-old boy, leaving a 14-year-old “seriously injured.”  That’s what happens in an autonomous zone. 
     The police chief, Carmen Best, who did a marvelous job winding down the CHOP zone noted that CHOP has become “lawless and brutal” and “enough is enough,” and she took action.  According to reports, quote, “Police also investigated several vehicles circling the CHOP zone” with “people inside carrying firearms and wearing body armor.”  This was no, quote, “summer of love,” as the Democrat mayor in Seattle said.
     And President Trump compelled action.  He has said, “Take back your city NOW.  If you don’t do it, I will.”  He has said, “This is not a game.  These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY.  MOVE FAST!” 
     And finally, the Democrat mayor in Seattle, who was long delayed, finally gave the order to dismantle the CHAZ.  And it was an admission — it was an admission that President Trump’s vision is right, that anarchy is wrong, and that law and order bring peace.
     And with that, I’ll take questions. 
     Kristen.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-070120/

720,Trump,2020-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Governor Ducey of Arizona on COVID-19 | Phoenix, AZ",Nan,"Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
Phoenix, Arizona
12:57 P.M. MST
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  We just completed a thorough briefing with Governor Ducey and his healthcare team here in Arizona about this state’s response to the rising number of coronavirus cases, and I’m going to share a few reflections on what we’ve heard and that’s what we’re determined to do. 
But before that, let me take a moment to reflect on another aspect of this day — a huge win for the people of Arizona, for American workers, farmers, and ranchers — and that is that, as of today, the USMCA has taken effect.  It is, I am told, it — this state in particular sees trade with Mexico and Canada support 228,000 jobs, $20 billion annually.
And I want to take this opportunity particularly to thank Governor Doug Ducey for his efforts in moving the USMCA through the Congress.  As a candidate, President Trump committed to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that put American jobs, American workers, farmers, and ranchers first, and we’ve done that.  And that promise was kept when the USMCA took effect today.  So, Governor Ducey, you have our sincerest thanks.
President Trump asked us to be here today, with the dramatic rise of coronavirus cases in Arizona, to receive a briefing from Governor Ducey and the healthcare team about this state’s response to this pandemic. 
And I want to say, first and foremost, to Governor Ducey that, from the very first days of this pandemic, your leadership and your entire team in Arizona has really formed a seamless partnership with our administration, with the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  And up until roughly three weeks ago, Arizona had literally set the pace in slowing the spread, in flattening the curve.  And we’re grateful to you, to your team, and to all the people of Arizona for all of their efforts over the past four months.
But with cases rising dramatically — and not just here in Maricopa County, but all across Arizona — we wanted to be here to get a report from the ground.  We’ll take back what we heard here today.  We’ll ensure with the team that we brought with us, including the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security who oversees FEMA, to make sure that Arizona has what you need, when you need it.
We told the governor today and we say to the people of Arizona: We’re with you, and we’re going to make sure that Arizona has whatever it takes to meet this moment, to slow the spread, to flat- — flatten the curve, to save lives.  That’s our commitment to each and every one of you.
We also brought along Admiral John Polowczyk, who has coordinated all of the PPE supplies, the construction of ventilators.  And while we are encouraged to hear today that’s the — the hospital capacity here remains strong on supplies and equipment, we did hear in the briefing today for the need for personnel.
We’ve already responded.  Sixty-two medical personnel arrived this week in Tucson.  But the governor conveyed to us an additional request for another 500 personnel, and I’ve instructed the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security to move out immediately on providing the additional doctors and nurses and technical personnel.
We want to say to all the incredible healthcare workers here in Arizona: Help is on the way.  And we’re going to spare no expense to provide the kind of reinforcements that you will need all across this state should this — this coronavirus pandemic continue to expand in Arizona.
As I said, we were encouraged to hear that hospital capacity remains manageable: 88 — 85 percent of medical beds and only 88 percent of ICU beds.  But the governor and I also spoke today about two additional facilities that were already reviewed and developed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the governor knows that we’re prepared to stand those surge facilities up in very short order if the need should arrive.
We’re going to make sure that that Arizona continues to have the healthcare capacity in this state to render to everyone who contracts the coronavirus the level of healthcare that we would want any one of our family members to receive.
And finally, let me say: The President and I couldn’t be more grateful for Governor Ducey’s leadership throughout this coronavirus pandemic.  But with cases rising in the last several weeks, we want to make it clear that we fully support the steps that Governor Doug Ducey and local health officials are implementing here across the state of Arizona to slow the spread.
Arizona flattened the curve early on in this pandemic, but we all noted something changed about the middle of May.  And that’s why this governor has stepped forward, took decisive action to put the health of the people of Arizona first.  And President Trump and I fully support the responsible steps that he’s taken to limit large gatherings; to pau- — pause operations of bars and gyms, movie theaters, and waterparks; and delay the start of school until August 17th. 
President Trump and I and our entire task force are absolutely committed, Governor, to supporting your efforts to respond to this outbreak, to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable so that we can keep our economy moving forward and get our kids back to school. 
The CDC just today posted new guidance for getting our kids back to school; yesterday posted new guidance for opening up colleges and universities.  The governor and I discussed today the paramount importance of us moving forward in a way where we can get our kids back into the classroom come this fall. 
It’s been — it’s been tremendous leadership here in Arizona since the first days of this pandemic.  Your healthcare workers have done a remarkable job, particularly in recent weeks and at this very hour, caring for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus.  But I want to say to all the good people of Arizona: We all need to do our part.  And we want to encourage every Arizonan to adhere to the guidance that the governor has issued and also the guidance of local authorities. 
We issue a particular plea to young people.  I was informed today by the Maricopa County Department of Health that more than 50 percent of all of those who are testing positive in Maricopa County are under the age of 35.  And young people know that, without an underlying health condition, that the threat to them of a serious outcome for the coronavirus remains low.  But we want to remind our young people: As you see the measures that the governor has put into place and you hear about the call for commonsense personal hygiene and the wearing of masks that this is about protecting our most vulnerable.
I’ve got three 20-somethings in my family, and I know that no young person here in Arizona would want to inadvertently expose a grandmother, or a grandfather, an elderly neighbor, a mom, or a dad to the coronavirus. 
And so to each of them, we want to commend all the steps the governor has put into place.  But we want to remind you that now is the time for all of us, particularly the young among us, to remember to wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask when indicated by state or local authorities or when social distancing is not possible.  We can all do our part to slow the spread, to flatten the curve, to save lives. 
And remember, it’s not an either/or.  Dr. Fauci said, not just a few short days ago, that we shouldn’t look at these public safety measures as an impediment to continuing to open up our economy; we should look at them as a vehicle to opening up.  The more we all do to support the public health measures that have put into effect, the quicker we can get Arizona’s economy growing, get our kids back to school, and that’s we’re determined to do. 
We’re all in this together.  And together, I’m very confident that, as all of us do our part each and every day, we’ll slow the spread, we’ll flatten the curve, we’ll save lives all across this state, and we will lay a foundation to bring this state’s economy back bigger and better than ever before.
So thank you very much.  And, Governor Ducey, thank you for an important and informative briefing.  We’re with you.
GOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President. 
I want to say thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership and your partnership throughout this pandemic.  It was great to see you today in person, but I’m able to see you at least once or twice a week on the constant communication that we have from the Coronavirus Task Force.  We very much appreciate it — your commitment and President’s — Trump’s commitment to serving Arizona and helping us solve the issues that are in front of us today.
I also want to thank the Coronavirus Task Force — to have Secretary Chad Wolf here today; Rear Admiral Polowczyk, who is talking to us about supplies; and Dr. Deborah Birx, who has been with us for several days in Arizona, meeting with leaders, decision makers, and influencers in the healthcare industry across our state, and actually seeing what’s happening across the Southwest, including New Mexico and Texas.  We’re grateful for what she has been able to contribute to the discussion, the questions she was able to answer, and guidance that she was able to clarify. 
I also want to thank General McGuire and Dr. Cara Christ, who are working with their counterparts in the federal government, and the hard work that they have been doing. 
And most of all, I want to say thankful — thank you to our healthcare workers who are on the front lines — our doctors, our nurses, our hospital staff, and all of our caregivers.  The decisions that we are making are to help you help the people in Arizona that need it. 
So our message is clear, in terms of where Arizona is today: You are safer at home.  We want to slow the spread of this virus and protect the most vulnerable.  We have taken the steps to temporarily close bars and gyms and waterparks, tubing, and movie theaters. 
We focused for a long time, and have done a very good job, on our most vulnerable — those that are 65 years or older and at high risk or with chronic health issues.  We now need the message to spread far and wide that we all can contribute to slowing the spread of this virus and have Arizona a safer place by following the fundamentals of masking up, washing your hands, maintaining that physical distance between others, and when you’re sick, staying home.
If we commit to that, and we do it with increased intensity over the next several weeks, we’re going to be in a different and better position in Arizona. 
So with that, again, I want to thank our federal partners, Vice President Pence and President Trump.  Whatever we have asked for and needed — whether it was increased testing or further support on contact tracing, personal protective equipment from face guards to gowns — the answer has been yes, and with urgency, in addition to helping clarify some federal guidance that will help our hospitals here on the ground with support and resources.
So I couldn’t be more grateful for your partnership and leadership in this battle.  It’s something we need to remain vigilant on, and also have flexibility to work with our local leaders across the state who have done an incredible job communicating the benefits of putting on a mask and how that can help our fellow citizens slow the virus and protect the most vulnerable. 
And with that, I want to turn the podium over to Secretary Wolf of Homeland Security, who has been an incredible partner as well on everything that Arizona has needed — not only with the focus from FEMA, but whatever issues we’ve had at the border, as well.  For that, we’re grateful.
Secretary Wolf.
SECRETARY WOLF:  Let me first start off by again thanking the Vice President for his leadership of the Coronavirus Task Force and the team that he’s really put together, several of which are here today.  It’s really been outstanding.
Let me also thank Governor Ducey, again, for your leadership throughout the pandemic, but particularly over the last several weeks as you’ve seen cases increase here, and again, for the team that you’ve pulled together as well.
DHS continues to proudly support Arizona and all the states that are continuing to respond to the pandemic.  We have done so.  We have obligated more than 90 million to the state of Arizona for National Guard operations, for alternative care facilities, other emergency protective measures, and we’ll continue to do that.
Let me also say that, again, through Admiral Polowczyk’s great efforts, we’ve been able to send over 318 million units of PPE to the state of Arizona as well, and we’ll continue to surge as we need to do that as well.
The Governor mentioned the border.  We continue to look at any threats that are coming across the border, and we put in some essential restrictions several months ago to make sure that we slowed the spread while keeping essential traffic and that trade occurring across your southern border — our southern border — Arizona’s southern border. 
It’s absolutely critical to the economies along that border into the U.S. economy, and we want to make sure that we get that right.  We’re continuing to assess that on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis to see if there’s any changes that we need to make.  And we’ll certainly talk about that at the task force.
But let me just end by again thanking the governor for his efforts throughout the pandemic.  And I will say, as we deal with the pandemic, we’re also dealing with other incidents that are going on throughout the country. 
So the governor’s strong support for law and order is vitally important in these days as the department is the country’s largest law enforcement agency.  And so we stand ready to support our state and local partners as we’re protecting federal facilities, we’re protecting monuments and statues, and the like.
So I want to again thank the governor for his outstanding work as well.
DR. BIRX:  Mr. Vice President, Governor Ducey, it’s been a privilege to be with the people of Arizona for the last two or three days.  What has been remarkable to me is watching the people of Arizona respond to the “Mask Up” Arizona guidelines that made it clear that we respect one another by wearing masks.  I saw that wherever I went for the last several days in Maricopa County, and I want to thank the people of Arizona for showing that respect for each other.
We know this virus is circulating actively in several counties.  We also know that there are other counties at risk, and I want to call on all the county leadership and the individuals in each of these counties that, as soon as you see an increase in your test positivity rate, to put on a mask, protect one another.
Governor Ducey’s directive is to really increase our — not only our respect for one another, but that clear communication coming from his health team that made it clear that wearing a mask will change the spread of this virus.  And also making it clear that, with this moment in time, closing the bars, decreasing restaurant spaces, and the other actions will really dramatically having an impact.
To all of our Millennials and Gen Z, thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and showing how important the mask and social distancing are, and that communication that you’re having with your parents and your grandparents to protect them. 
But I also want to call on you to be aware that there are people in your age group — people in your age group, every day, that have preexisting conditions that you may not know about — that may have diabetes, that may have hypertension, that may have a weight issue.  These individuals, no matter what their age, are susceptible.  And you can see it in the hospitalizations here in Arizona.  So you’re not only protecting those we totally respect in the over-65 age group, but you’re protecting one another.  And I appreciate that. 
Yesterday, I got to meet with an entire group, and it showed the Governor’s commitment and the health commitment of Dr. Christ to understanding guidelines don’t work unless they’re translated and working alongside community members. 
So in that meeting — for community members from the Hispanic community, from the African American community, and today I got to meet with the tribal nation leaders — understanding that messages are not a standalone; that they have to translate into the very fabric of our communities so that people understand what their risks are, so that people can get tested, and so that people understand the importance of wearing a mask. 
I also saw incredible innovation of the American spirit.  We heard from your universities and we heard from your hospitals of the advances that you’re taking into the field and care for those who need us the most, and the innovations coming out of your universities to provide innovations and testing and really expanding testing. 
We talked about how to 10x testing through pooling and communities — communities that are in multi-generational households — bringing testing to the community and to those households, and using household pools to be able to test in 100 percent of the community. 
I want to thank the African American leader I met yesterday from the community who set up an African American task force to really make sure that messages from the Governor and the health team were being translated at the level of the people who needed to hear it. 
I thank you for bringing together and understanding that words that aren’t translated into actions will not stop this virus.  But I am encouraged and I am hopeful, and I am hoping we will see the dramatic impact of you all taking responsibility and wearing masks, so when it comes to August, we can open the schools and open the universities because we know we can stop the spread by utilizing masks and making these small adjustments into our lifestyle and show respect for one another. 
So thank you, Governor Ducey, for your leadership, for your looking at the science and the data and the evidence.  Thank you to your health team and the brilliant Dr. Christ.  It’s been a pleasure to spend time with you and your amazing county public health leaders who understand how to get into the community.  Thank you for your time and the respect that you gave me by wearing masks in public. 
Thank you.
GOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you, Deb.

724,Trump,2020-06-30 11:32:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force | Rockville, MDxz",Nan,"United States Public Health Service Headquarters
Rockville, Maryland
4:32 P.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for joining us.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but it is a particular honor to be here at the headquarters of the United States Public Health Service to make an important announcement on the establishment of the Ready Reserve Corps.
And also, on behalf of the President and on behalf of entire team, to express our gratitude to the women and men who wear the blue uniforms across the country and have served our nation with such distinction and compassion over the past four months.
I’m — I’m here with several members of our team, who you will hear from in the course of this briefing.  But as we gather here today, more than 2.6 million coronavirus cases in the United States; sadly, we’ve lost more than 129,000 Americans.
The data report that we received today from Dr. Deborah Birx — who is, as we speak, in Arizona, briefing with Governor Ducey and their team — is that, at this moment, we have 12 states with rising cases and percent-positive cases — a combination of both rising cases and rising percent positive.  Beyond that, there are another 28 states that either have rising cases or rising positives but do not have a combination of those two things.
We also continue to see that roughly 50 percent of all the new cases are taking place in four states.  And so, as you would anticipate, we’re — we are working with governors and state health officials in all of the states that are impacted, but we’re particularly focusing on the four states that are generating the majority of the cases which, of course, are California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.
I’m pleased to say that, while there are 29 states that have — don’t have a combination of rising positivity and rising cases, we also have an additional 10 states that are either entirely stable or have numbers that are so low that they’re de minimis.  So our focus, particularly at the task force today, was on the 12 states that have the combination.
Beyond that, while one life lost is too many and we mourn the loss of every American and grieve with every family that lost a loved one, because of the dedication of our healthcare workers, because of our response and the response of the American people, we are grateful that, today, fatalities are at the lowest level since the end of March.
We continue to be vigilant as we see rising cases.  We understand that that could — that could change.  But again, to see the precipitous decline in fatalities is a tribute to the healthcare workers in this country and to the cooperation and the compassion of the American people.
Our message to every American in the states that are most affected by rising cases and rising positivity rates is: We are with you.  We are working with the governors in your state to ensure that they have the resources and the support to meet this moment and provide the level of healthcare that any one of us would expect for a member of our family.
But to all of the American people, I say, on behalf of the President of the United States and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that because of all that we’ve done over the last four months, we’re ready.  We’re in a much better place than we were four months ago or even two months ago.  And part of our briefing today will focus on the progress that we have made and our ability to respond to the outbreaks that we’re seeing occurring in states, particularly across the south.
I’ve been traveling across the country — I was actually in Texas over this past weekend; received a full briefing from Governor Abbott about their response — and I will be traveling to Arizona tomorrow, meeting with Governor Ducey.  And I’ll be able to confirm to him that we were informed today that a team deployed by FEMA of 62 Disaster Medical Assistance personnel are on the ground in Arizona.  We’re also currently processing a request from Texas, and we’re in consultation with other states.
As you will hear in a moment, with regard to testing, with regard to personal protective equipment, with regard to ventilators, with regard to therapeutic medicines, we are in a strong position all across the affected areas of the country to meet this moment.  But in consultation with the states, we’re — we’re going to make sure that they have the reinforcements in healthcare workers.  And I’m pleased to confirm today that 62 DMAT, or Disaster Medical Assistant Team, members have arrived in Arizona.
I’ll also be traveling later this week to the state of Florida, where Dr. Birx and I will also receive a briefing, along with Secretary Azar, about that state’s response.
At the present moment, all 50 states in the country are reopening and have done so in one degree or another since the beginning of May, when we issued our Guidelines to Open Up America Again.
At this moment in time, because of the rising cases, at least four states have taken action to close down bars, limit capacity in restaurants, and another 10 states have slowed down or postponed certain reopening efforts.
And let me make it very clear that we fully support the new guidance that’s been issued by the governors in these states.  We truly do believe that these prudent measures and additional guidance and steps will make it possible for us to continue to move our nation forward, to continue to reopen in a safe and responsible way, while putting the health — the health of our citizens first.
I thought Dr. Fauci put it well in a recent task force meeting when he said, and I think also testified today, that we “should not look at public safety measures as an impediment to opening up America, [that] rather, we should look at them as the vehicle to opening up,” as we see rising cases in particularly those 12 states where we have a combination of rising cases and positivity.
The American people deserve to know that our best health experts say it’s not an either/or.  It’s not whether we continue to open up or whether we move in an opposite direction, but rather it’s whether we take these prudent measures that will slow the spread and put the health of our citizens first.
Our governors in the affected areas and their public health officials are making — are taking strong action to keep their states open, while slowing the spread and putting the health of their citizens first.  And they have our full support.
Let me say again, as I said at the outset: The American people deserve to know that we’re in a much better place today, thanks to the whole-of-government approach, the whole-of-America approach that President Trump initiated at the very outset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The — working in cooperation with agencies across the federal government, working with the private sector across this country, we literally have scaled — now 33 million tests have been performed across the United States.
And as Admiral Brett Giroir will detail momentarily, we’re — we’re testing between 500 and 600 thousand Americans every single day, with the capacity to significantly increase that through the innovation of what is known as “pooling.”
And when it comes to medical supplies, FEMA has facilitated the delivery of literally billions of gloves and gowns and masks.  And as Admiral Polowczyk will detail in just a few moments, we are in continuous contact with not just states, but with hospitals in states across the country.  And we continue to receive very strong reports about the support they’ve received and the supplies that are available to meet this moment.
Also, we’re in a much better place because of the availability of what’s known as therapeutics or medicines to treat people that have contracted the coronavirus and are experiencing severe symptoms.
Now, Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA is here, and he will speak about the progress that we are making, whether it be the availability of remdesivir, which we’re distributing another tranche this week; the use of blood plasma, of steroid treatments; and — also, we continue to hear very hopeful signs about the continuing — continuing progress for developing a vaccine for the American people.
And so, with that, I’m going to — I’m going to yield to the team here to give you updates.  I’m going to begin with Secretary Azar, who will update us on our national response, including important work the CDC did today with regard to opening up our schools again.  And then Admiral Giroir will update us on testing, Admiral Polowczyk on supplies, and Dr. Hahn on medicines.  And then, finally, we’ll hear from Dr. Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General of the United States, who will give counsel to every American in the states that are impacted and all across the country about best practices.
So to every American in states that are seeing rising cases and rising trends in positivity: We want — we want to assure you we’re with you.  And we’re deploying, at the President’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to meet this moment and working in strong partnership with your state and local officials.
And to every American: We want to assure you that we’re ready, more ready than ever before, to meet this coronavirus pandemic because of the — because of the resources that our President, that agencies at the federal government, the steps deployed and efforts at state government, and mostly because of what the American people have done and demonstrated that they have the ability to do.
I mean, the truth is, while we’ve made great progress on making availability of testing and supplies and medicines, we all need to do our part.  We know how to slow the spread.  And the commonsense measures that we outlined in our phased approach to open up America again, the guidelines that apply to all of the phases are — ought to be embraced by every American: wash your hands, practice good hygiene, and wear a mask.  Wear a mask when — whenever your state and local authorities say it’s appropriate.  It’s always good idea to wear a mask when social distancing is not possible.
We’re all in this together, and we have every confidence that as we met the moment before when we saw this pandemic first strike in the northwest and then strike so hard around the Greater New York City area, then New Orleans, then Michigan, that with a with a — with a whole-of-government approach, a whole-of-America approach, cooperation of the American people, we’ll do what we did earlier on in this pandemic: We’ll slow the spread and we’ll save lives.
And with that, Secretary Azar and members of the team will brief, and then we’ll have time for questions.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President, for honoring HHS and the Commissioned Corps with your presence today.  And thank you for your leadership of the President’s all-of-America response to COVID-19.
I’d also like to thank Admiral Giroir and Vice Admiral Adams for their service during this crisis and for their dedication to strengthening the Commissioned Corps.
The men and women of the Commissioned Corps have been and will continue to be central to our COVID-19 response and on all six points of our strategy to defeat the virus: surveillance, testing, containment, healthcare capacity, vaccines, and therapeutics.
To every member of the Commissioned Corps who’s gone into harm’s way in this crisis, who’s spent time away from home and loved ones, we are deeply grateful.
I want to mention one particular step forward we took today to help Americans get back to work and back to school while protecting us from the virus: new guidance from the CDC as to how higher education institutions can protect students and their employees.  In particular, it offers recommendations for how and when testing should be used for students, faculty, and staff, including both testing for symptomatic individuals and testing for asymptomatic individuals who’ve had possible exposure to the virus.
The guidance also notes that in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, where resources allow, colleges and universities can work with local health officials to consider testing asymptomatic students and staff who have no known exposure.  This may make sense in order to identify outbreaks and inform control measures, and would especially apply to groups like those living in congregate housing.
This guidance relies on what we’ve learned about the virus in recent months.  In the very near future, we will also be releasing similar guidance around K-through-12 schools, recognizing how important safe schools are to reopening our country.
These are just two examples of the science-based resources that we’re providing for state and local health departments and other institutions as they work with federal assistance to continue the fight against the virus and to reopen our country.
We need to reopen America.  We have to get back to work, back to school, back to worship, back to healthcare.  But we must all play our individual parts to enable this reopening.  We can reverse these outbreaks and prevent future ones by doing what the President has called for since the beginning in his guidance: practice social distancing, wear facial coverings where social distancing is not possible, and practice good personal hygiene.
By doing so, you protect yourself, you protect vulnerable household members, but you also protect the person you may be standing next to in the grocery line.  And you don’t know whether they’re vulnerable.  You have no way of knowing whether they’re at high risk of severity, hospitalization, or fatality.  You protect them.
There’s just three simple steps to keep reopening: social distance; wear facial coverings when you can’t social distance; and practice good personal hygiene.  It’s all we need to do to keep reopening.  We can work, go to school, go to worship, reengage with healthcare, if we all, as individuals, practice good, responsible behavior to protect each other and to protect ourselves.
So thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well done.  Admiral?
ADMIRAL GIRIOR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mr. Secretary.  Again, you did us an incredible honor by being here and honoring and appreciating the 6,100 women and men of the Commissioned Corps.  We do say women and men; we are a 55 percent female service and the most diverse within the country.
I’m going to take a few minutes and talk about testing.  As both the Vice President and the Secretary said, we’re a world different than we were in March.  At that time in early March, we’d only done a few thousand tests.  Now we’re doing 550, 600 thousand.  We’ve actually gone over 600,000 per day, on occasion; over 33 million tests.
And I think all of you know there’s some components to this.  There’s, sort of, the front end — somebody to take the swab or to supervise you doing that swab.  You got to have the supplies there, you got to have the machines, and you got to have the laboratory tests.
So on the front end, way back in March, this had to be done by a practitioner, with a very deep nasal pharyngeal swab in full PPE.  We could not get to where we are today, from there, without a lot of science and a lot of collaboration from the FDA.
Because we’re able to validate nasal self-swabbing, those 41 sites turned into what you saw today, in the press, over 600 retail pharmacy sites that have now been extended for several months, continuing from their first June 30th closure now, at least through August, where there’s supervised self-swabbing.  That has translated into another 1,400 CVS sites.  So now 2,000 retail pharmacy sites, born from those first 41, in over 1,300 federally qualified health center sites.  Again, most of these focused on the most underserved communities and vulnerable communities.
So we’re scaling that, and every week we’re getting new authorizations from the FDA to take it the next step further, and that’s home self-swabbing.  There are some authorizations that are home self-swabbing and some that are video assisted, so we could eliminate a lot of the whole front-end problem where we are.
As I said many times, we’re scaling testing on a routine basis.  And I’ve told you that, assuming no technological innovations, we will easily be at 40 to 50 million tests available by September.  That’s a very conservative estimate — very conservative estimate — because the industry tells us we’ll be at a much higher place.
But what are some of the innovations we’re seeing right now being implemented, again, under the guidance of the FDA, validated, high quality?  And that’s pooling.  You’ve heard — you’ve heard something about pooling.  Pooling is very helpful because it could combine more than one sample in a single laboratory assay.
So imagine this situation where I wanted to know if all of you were potentially negative, and I thought you were probably negative because you don’t have a history, you’re not febrile, you haven’t been in contact with anyone.  So you could collect your own swabs, you can put them in tubes, and we can take all of those tubes, or at least 10 of them, and put them into a simple tube and do that assay.  If that one single assay is negative, then you’re all negative, if you do it appropriately.  So you can leverage 2 times, 5 times, possibly even up to 10 times or even more.
This is being done now in many universities and many commercial laboratories, and we are absolutely working with everyone in the community to do this.  It’s not right all the time, but it’s right a lot of the time.  So of those 18, 20 million tests per month that we’ll probably be doing in July, or out of those 35 to 50, 60 million tests we’re doing in September, you can do the math and multiply at least a portion of those by two, three, or even five.  So that’s where pooling is going to get us.
The final thing I would like to say is, the RADx program, that’s the diagnostics program at NIH, as well as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, are really making great inroads to innovation.  This was funded to sort of get us to the next step, to provide more rapid tests, higher quantities of tests, completely different kinds of tests.
Now, again, we’re not assuming any breakthrough innovations, but there’s going to be some, and I’m very excited about that.  The NIH Director Francis Collins, the BARDA Director Dr. Gary Disbrow, and I work on literally on a daily basis to make sure that the innovations that come on will be translated immediately to our public health system.
So I’d be happy to take your questions later on today.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Admiral Giroir, and thank you for your great efforts.  I know I speak for people all across this country when I express how proud we are of the extraordinary progress.
And the way we’ve scaled testing across America is historic.  When I was tapped to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we had done less than 8,000 coronavirus tests.  And to think that, in the intervening months, now 33 million tests and the ability to scale beyond that, it’s a — it is a great comfort to the American people and a great tribute — a great tribute to the public-private partnership that President Trump forged early on.
I think it’s also been historic to see the progress that we’ve made on personal protective equipment and particularly for Americans in the four states where 50 percent of the cases are occurring, or the 12 states where we’re seeing a combination of rising cases in positivity.  We want the American people to know that the personal protective equipment for our healthcare providers is also at a historic level.
And I’ve asked Admiral John Polowczyk to come and to articulate where we stand to date with the hospitals and healthcare facilities in the impacted areas, and our ongoing effort to ensure that the extraordinary doctors and nurses and healthcare workers that are, at this very hour, ministering to Americans struggling with the coronavirus have the masks, the gowns, the gloves, the ventilators, and all the personal protective equipment they need to render that care.
But Admiral Polowczyk?
ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you Mr. Vice President.  Back in March, mid-March, when I was moved from the Pentagon to FEMA, the President gave me one task: Provide our healthcare workers the supplies they need, what they need, when they need it.
And I’m going to give you a short update today, and I think the theme is: “We have more” — “They have more.”
So, from that time in March, mid-March until now, we are in a fundamentally better position.  I’m going to go through some details that makes me that confident.  And personally — those that personally know me, I’m a my glass half full type of person.  And so for these — these details I find very encouraging.
As we, over the last few weeks, tried to ascertain how well states and hospital networks are preparing, and preparing for the summer into the fall, we held a round of state calls with every state emergency manager and every state health official facilitated by the FEMA regional administrator.  So we went through every region and every state, and had a discussion about what we were doing for the National Stockpile and what they were doing for their states.
That call led me to believe that 65 to 70 percent of the states have at least 30 days of supply on hand, if not 60.  There are many states that have more than 60, that have targets of 90, and looking to achieve that.  Those state calls have made me confident of the numbers that we’re putting into our modernized National Stockpile.
Here in recent weeks, with the uptick in cases, where Dr. Birx has highlighted down to the county level, my team has called those hospitals.  And I am here to provide a synopsis of that.  We’ve talked to hospitals in Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, and on down the line.  Many of them are reporting 30 to 40 days of supply on hand.  Now, there are some sporadic shortages, but mostly in the size of — the size of masks.  “Could I have more small masks?”
So we took that information, and I talked to 3M today, as a matter of fact.  And they’ve already changed — based on the discussions with my team, they’re already changed their production to produce more small and extra-small masks.  So essentially, almost an even split — 40, 45, 50 percent were smalls, to then the — to the rest to normal supplies.
So states are saying they have supplies.  Hospitals and areas where there are outbreaks are having more supplies.
Another data tool: The National Health Safety Network, where — the CDC-run network where hospitals report days of supplies on hand across the nation — those supplies, back in March — there were many hospitals that were saying that they had less than three days.  Now folks have multiple weeks — the majority of hospitals.  So we are — we are fundamentally in a different place.
One of the things we did was we assembled all of the business-system data for the medical supply chain — for the commercial medical supply chain.  I have that (inaudible) at FEMA.  And I can see the demand from hospitals and the supply to them.  And those numbers are coming together, where supply is getting much closer to demand — all at the same time that states are stockpiling, municipalities are stockpiling, hospitals are stockpiling, and the federal government — with the Health and Human Services, Strategic National Stockpile — is being replenished.
So let me — let me shift topics to the nursing home project just real quick.  We’re on our second round of the nursing home project.  You know, those give a little bit more than a week’s worth of supply each.  Each round has, you know, almost 2 million sets of eye protection; 14 million masks; 63 million gowns — gloves; and 13 million gowns to get to the 15,000-plus nursing homes.  We’re 60 percent through this second round, and 45 percent have been delivered.
And finally, let me just touch on ventilators.  So back in March, the National Stockpile had approximately 19,000 ventilators.  Today, ready for deployment, we have 48,000.  By next week, if the production schedules hold, we’ll have 55,000.  So we are — we are in a fundamentally different place for supplies than we are.
Pending your questions later, Mr. Vice President, that’s all I have.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you.
And one other area where we’ve made great strides and we hope and pray to make good strides in the months ahead has been in the area of therapeutics and in the headlong pursuit of vaccines.  And when we see the extraordinary decline in fatalities over the last two months, it is a tribute, first, to our healthcare workers, to all that they’ve done — but it’s also a tribute to the availability of what are known as therapeutics — medicines like remdesivir; the new steroid treatment that you all have heard about; the availability of plasma treatments.
And I wanted to Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA to update us on the medicines, as well as where we stand on vaccines.
Dr. Hahn.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  President Trump asked the FDA early on in the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce any unnecessary regulatory barriers to get medical products into the hands of Americans.  And FDA created an emergency review and development program for therapies called the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, and we have supported that program since that time, and it continues to this day.
I’d like to first start by telling you that the pipeline of therapeutics treatments that we see across this country — the great academics, researchers, private sector — that pipeline is very robust.
Currently — currently, as a recent count, FDA is monitoring more than 144 active trials of therapeutic agents for COVID-19, and another 457 development programs for therapeutic agents is in the pipeline.
So we’re at a vastly different place than we were three months ago, two months ago.  The nation’s work is paying off, as we saw the positive results of the recent National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease trial of remdesivir in certain hospitalized patients with a significant 30 percent reduction in the length of hospital stay for severe COVID-19 patients.
We also recently updated the clinical guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, with the addition of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids, with a trial that reported a 30 percent reduction in mortality in severely ill patients.
Those two therapies alone will have a significant impact on the natural history and the course of this disease, and provides great hope for those who get sick with this and are hospitalized.
But our work isn’t done; more is in the pipeline.  As I mentioned, over 25,000 patients in the United States have been treated on our expanded access convalescent plasma program.  Now, just as a reminder, that’s where we take antibodies — the antibodies that are naturally developed by someone who has gotten the COVID-19 virus and then has recovered — and then we administer that to someone who’s sick with COVID-19.
This has worked in other diseases in the past.  We have some preliminary safety data in over 20,000 patients.  It shows that this therapy is safe.  And we’re currently evaluating the efficacy of this — the effectiveness of this program.  We have great hope for that.
Now that information will tell us a lot about, if a person develops antibodies, how protective are those antibodies — what level do you need.  And it also gives us information for the next set of therapeutics that are coming down the pike.
Already, in clinical trials, we have a number of agents called “monoclonal antibodies,” which are synthetic forms of antibodies — so, genetically engineered antibodies that can then be given.  Again, these have been used in other infectious diseases, and we have hope that they would also work in these disease — in COVID-19.  And we expect the readout of those trials over the next several months, possibly late summer and early fall.
So I just want to switch gears to talk about vaccines.  Under the leadership of Secretary Azar and Operation Warp Speed, we have seen the sponsorship of a number of different vaccines.  But we know that vaccines are being developed around the world, and FDA has received applications from a double-digit number of sponsors regarding vaccines.
Four vaccines have been approved for moving into clinical trials — that is, authorized to go into clinical trials so we can get the data on those vaccines — and another six are in the pipeline for us to review.
We’ve seen recent reports of interesting and, I think, positive data regarding the immunogenicity — that is, how well these vaccines stimulate an immune response in people and also regarding their safety.
More work needs to be done, but I think we’ve seen some positive results to date.  And obviously, we need to make sure that those studies mature so that we can have the data we need.
Now, FDA recognizes the need and urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19, and we’ve been working collaboratively with all industry and all of our partners in academia, as well as in government, on that.
Today, we took additional action to facilitate the timely development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 by providing new guidance with recommendations for those developing COVID-19 vaccines.  And the goal of this guidance is to assist in the clinical development, and ultimately, hopefully the licensure of a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
Now, it’s very important to have this guidance because it provides regulatory transparency and clarity to the developers — what is FDA expecting to see in terms of data and science in the context of clinical trials — so that we can make the absolute best decision for the American people.
Now, while the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in order to approve a vaccine, and we will make clear through this guidance what data are needed to meet our regulatory standards.
I remain cautiously optimistic about our timeline with respect to vaccines.  We will see what the data show.  But clearly, from a therapeutics point of view, there are more tools in the toolbox for the great providers of this country to treat patients with COVID-19.
And then finally, I’d like to add to what the Vice President said, and that is: Mask wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene, and other forms of hygiene — this is how we’re going to keep America open again.  I’ve heard from colleagues around the country, my former colleagues in cancer care, from friends and families — nobody wants to shut down again.  Our way of keeping open is with these public health measures.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Hahn.
And as you can see, we’re in a much better place, whether it be testing, whether it be personal protective equipment, whether it be ventilators, or whether it be the availability of medicines that are speeding relief to Americans struggling with coronavirus.
And I — and I promise you that, as the President has directed from the very beginning, we’re going to continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of governors and states that are being impacted by the latest outbreak of the coronavirus.
But as we said at the beginning, we’re all in this together and we all have a role to play.  And so I wanted to ask the Surgeon General to bring a few remarks about — about how every American can play their part to slow the spread, to put into practice the kind of personal habits that will ensure not just that they protect their own health or the health of a family member or friend, but most especially, as has been said already, we see that roughly half of the new cases in Texas and Florida, we are told, are among Americans under the age of 35, for whom the threat of serious outcomes from the coronavirus is fairly low.
But it’s not just about protecting yourself as a young person; it’s about making sure that anyone who is vulnerable to a serious outcome with the coronavirus is protected.  No one of any age would ever want to inadvertently expose a mother, a father, a grandmother, or a grandfather.
And what the Surgeon General will share with us are the kind of practices that will make it possible for all of us to do our part to slow the spread, to heal our land, even as we continue to open up America again.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Good evening, everyone.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here at Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Headquarters today.  We very much appreciate it.
And I just want to start off by saying that we absolutely cannot afford to lose focus on the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on vulnerable communities, particularly communities of color.
Compared to whites, American Indians and Alaskan Natives are hospitalized at five times the rate; black Americans hospitalized at four and a half times the rate; Hispanics three and a half times the rate.
The fact is, this virus is exploiting and exacerbating preexisting health disparities, and these disparate outcomes and equitable opportunities for health are part of the anger, the frustration, and the fear that we’re seeing manifest in protests around the country.
The fact is, social justice and social injustice often reveals itself through health inequities, and the administration and my office are using our unique levers, including the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, to ensure that every American has the opportunity to be healthy.
At Secretary Azar’s direction, we’ve been working at HHS to address these disparities long before the pandemic.  But in response to the pandemic, we’ve taken a number of additional immediate actions.  And as we’re talking about both the burden of disease in our communities, but the resources that are now available to folks to help respond, I want to quickly run down some of these efforts.
Admiral Giroir has led our increase in community-based testing — over 600 sites.  Seventy percent of them are in communities that have a high social vulnerability index, which means they’re disproportionately serving people of color.
CDC now requires all testing data reported by states to include information on race, ethnicity, and ZIP Code.  This mandate will help us better understand who is most affected and how to target interventions on the hardest-hit communities.  HHS recently allocated $15 billion to Medicaid providers and $10 billion to safety-net hospitals which serve large numbers of our most vulnerable Americans.
The administration has also invested critical resources in community health centers — which I often say are our best kept secrets — ensuring that 28 million people living in medically underserved areas have access to care and testing that they need.  We don’t want our federally qualified and community health centers to be secrets to the people who most can benefit from the care that they receive there.
And Secretary Azar — and I want to thank you for this, sir — has instructed my office to expedite calls to action on hypertension — which is the number one risk factor for COVID complications — and maternal mortality, both of which disproportionately impact people of color.  And I am very worried about infant mortality and maternal mortality going up in the midst of COVID because women are scared to go out and get care.  We need to safely reopen so that people can get the care that they need beyond COVID.
Last week, you heard Admiral Giroir announce that Morehouse School of Medicine was awarded $40 million as part of a cooperative agreement with the Office of Minority Health.  This effort will be a major leap forward and help us achieve our goal of delivering important COVID-19 updates and information in ways and through channels that best reach minority communities.
And speaking of reaching minority communities, we’re really digging into engagement with other folks.  So I had a phone call, last week, with over 100 different organizations that are embedded in communities.  Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the National Hispanic Medical Association, the National Association of Black Nurses, and over 100 other organizations were the phone call.  This administration — HHS — we’re committed to outreach to make sure that we can get the information to the people who most need to benefit from it.
And to the point of the VP’s visit here today.  One of the reasons I’m proud to be a leader in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is our mission to serve the underserved.  Having a Ready Reserve, which is the announcement that we made earlier today, will augment our efforts to eliminate health disparities and ensure everyone has the best chance at a long and healthy life.
One of eight uniformed services, the Public Health Service is the only one dedicated solely to protecting and promoting America’s public health.  By a number of metrics, we are the most diverse uniformed service.  Over 50 percent of our officers are female and only 40 percent identify as white and non-Hispanic.
We provide essential health services where most others do not go — dare not go, in some cases — to provide care for vulnerable and underserved populations.
The bulk of our officers are at Indian Health Service’s — Health Service’s facilities, and we have a large number of officers in the Bureau of Prisons — two communities that have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19.
We serve on the frontline of public health emergencies.  My first deployment was to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after three Category 5 hurricanes in a row hit those unfortunate territories.  We respond quickly to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and global public health emergencies like Ebola, as well as serve on humanitarian missions.
We also advanced innovation in science and work at the forefront of medical challenges like COVID-19, cancer, and the opioid crisis, providing new treatments and cures.
Which leads me to my finish.  We are in a much better place to treat COVID than what we were two months ago, four months ago, even just a few weeks ago.
You heard Admiral Polowczyk talk about how we are better supplied than what we were.  Doesn’t mean that it’s mission accomplished, but we are in a much better place now with PPE and with other supplies.  With steroids, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma, if you get COVID-19, we are in a much better position to get you out of the hospital safely.
But public health is all about prevention.  And I’m a leader in the Public Health Service Corps.  So, I want to talk about prevention.  My Surgeon General’s prescription — which I first announced to you all way back in March — three things: Number one, know your risk.  Are you at high risk?  Are you at low risk?  Are you at intermediate risk for COVID-19?
Number two, know your circumstances.  Are you in a community where rates are going up?  Are you in a community where rates are going down?  Are you going to a place where you can take precautions like being outside and social distancing?
And number three, know how to stay safe.  And that includes everything from making sure we’re taking basic precautions, to staying home if you’re at high risk or you’re going to a high-risk place.
The fact is, we’re seeing an increase in cases and an increase in hospitalizations in those under 40.  So we need everyone to follow our preventive guidelines.  Stay home if you’re sick.  Stay at home if you’re vulnerable.  And again, we know people are more vulnerable as they get older, but they’re also vulnerable if they have hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.  Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently went out.  Maintain six feet of distance between you and others when you’re out.  And please, please, please wear a face covering when you go out in public.  It is not an inconvenience.  It is not a suppression of your freedom.  It actually is a vehicle to achieve our goals.  It adds to your convenience and your freedom because it allows us to open up more places and it allows us places to stay open.  When you do not wear your face covering, we end up in a situation where you see higher rates of disease spread and you end up having to close places.  This mask, this face covering, actually is an instrument of freedom for Americans if we all use it.
Young people, I just want to close by asking you to work with us, please.  Work with us because I know that many of you feel like you’re not at risk or you’re not as high of a risk, but we need all of you to help protect the most vulnerable, but also to protect yourselves and to give you more options.
If you want the return of college football this year, wear a face covering.  If you want a chance at prom next spring, wear a face covering.  I had a interview earlier with a North Carolina radio station; if you want to see North Carolina beat Duke in person this year, wear a face covering.  And I grew up in Maryland and in Indiana, so sorry, Duke, but I — as long as somebody beats you, I’m okay with that.  (Laughter.)  If you want to go on spring break next March, next April, wear a face covering.
I want you all to understand that this is not meant to be pessimistic.  I am actually confident, based on the data we’ve seen around the country and around the world, that if we do the right things, we actually can reopen and stay open.
COVID time is a long time.  In just a few weeks, we can drastically see things go in the wrong direction, but we also can drastically see things improve.  If you all will commit to wearing these face coverings and taking basic public health precautions, as the nation’s doctor, as America’s doctor, I want you to know I have every confidence that we can very quickly see these new case counts go down, and we can reopen, we can get back to school, to work, to worship, and to college football.
But we’ve all got to do our part.  It’s up to you, America.  If you join in and we all do our part, we all win.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Adams.  Thank you so much.  We’ve got time for a few questions.
Great.  Mario.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-rockville-mdxz/

3:49 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  The front page of the New York Times is not the venue for discussing classified information.  The White House podium is not the venue for discussing classified information.  We are here today, having this discussion, because of an irresponsible, anonymous leak to the New York Times.  There is no good scenario as a result of this New York Times report.
Who’s going to want to cooperate with the United States intelligence community, who’s going to want to be a source or an asset, if they know that their identity could be disclosed?  Which allies will want to share information with us if they know that some rogue intelligence officer can go splash that information on the front page of a major U.S. newspaper?
Specifically, there are two bad scenarios that emerge from this report: Number one, this report makes it more difficult to come to a consensus on this matter, to verify intelligence.  And number two, this level of controversy and discord plays directly into the hands of Russia and, unfortunately, serves their interests.
Since before President Trump assumed office, damaging and oftentimes erroneous leaks seeking to undermine or delegitimize the duly elected president have been published.  According to the DOJ, classified leaks surged in this administration.  There were, under President Obama, just 39, on average, criminal leak referrals.  In this administration, we’ve seen 100 criminal leak referrals to the DOJ in 2017, 88 in 2018, and 104 on average per year.
We have seen targeted leaks of classified information against this President, and it is irresponsible: phone calls with foreign leaders, meetings with government officials, and now reports of alleged intelligence.  Make no mistake: This damages our ability, as a nation, to collect intelligence.
As the National Security Council noted just yesterday, “To those government officials who betray the trust of the people of the United States by leaking classified information, your actions endanger our national security.”
The ODNI said, “The selective leaking of any classified information disrupts the vital interagency work to collect, assess, and mitigate threats, and places our forces at risk.  It is also, simply put, a crime.”
And finally, the CIA said this: that “Leaks compromise and disrupt the critical interagency work to collect, assess, and ascribe culpability.”
To the anonymous sources who leak classified information, you should know this: You may seek to undermine our President, but in fact, you undermine our country’s safety and our country’s security.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

1:25 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Law and order are the building blocks to the American Dream, but if anarchy prevails, this dream comes crum- — comes crumbling down.  Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable, and anger is not enough.  You have a President committed to action.
The DOJ has arrested over 100 anarchists for rioting and destruction of federal property.  The DOJ has also charged four men in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  The FBI has over 200 open domestic terrorism investigations ongoing.  AG Barr has created a task force on violent anti-government extremists led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Northern Texas.
With 200 Trump-appointed judges confirmed, the rule of law will be upheld.  Democrats at all lev- — at all levels — federal, state, and local — have done nothing.  Senate Democrats blocked bipartisan police reform.  Minnesota’s Democrat governor failed to urgently deploy the National Guard — it took President Trump for that to eventually happen; his suggestion — and the ultimate descendance into chaos there in Minneapolis.
Three Democrat Minneapolis councilmembers voted to abolish the police, while they themselves were getting a private security detail.  That’s quite rich.
Democrat mayor of Seattle called the CHOP zone — the autonomous zone — “the summer of love.”  It is anything but that with one dead, multiple shootings, and desperate pleas for help unanswered by business owners and others.
Eleven people were shot in 12 hours this weekend in the Democrat-run New York City.  And 61 people were shot in Democrat-run Chicago, and 15 fatally killed — a Democrat state, a Democrat city.
President Trump stands against defunding our brave police officers, caving to mob rule, and cancel culture which seeks to erase our history.
Let’s be clear: The rampant destruction of statues is not a part of any ideology, but this anarchy is aided by failed Democrat leadership.  And as President Trump has tweeted, these statues, quote, “are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage, both the good and the bad.  It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and to learn from them.”

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This past Father’s Day weekend, we saw violence across the country, but we saw scant media coverage of this violence.
Let’s be clear here: The states are responsible for policing their streets.  The governors, the mayors are responsible for ensuring that our streets are safe, that the American people are protected.  And what we have seen is, in far too many Democrat-runs states and Democrat-run cities, we have seen violence and chaos and nothing like the law and order that we saw here in D.C. when President Trump stepped in and surged the National Guard.
In Chicago, for instance, we saw over 100 people were shot and 14 tragically killed, including a three-year-old was among the victims.  And one local news outlet tragically reported that multiple teenagers were killed in Chicago this weekend as well.
In Minneapolis, 11 people were shot and one person killed.  One individual was a father of two who worked as a barber and our hearts break for this family.
Also in Democrat-run New York City, we saw that the New York Post reported that there was one shooting per hour this Saturday — absolutely inexcusable — with 24 people shot on Saturday alone.
And then in Democrat-run Seattle, we’ve seen the autonomous zone, otherwise known as “CHOP” — C-H-O-P.  One person was shot and killed in this autonomous zone run by radical anarchists.  And also, we saw another shooting there yesterday as well.  And the Democrat mayor of the city called CHOP, quote, “the Summer of Love,” but it has been nothing of this sort, clearly, with two individuals shot, one person shot and killed.
It is the responsibility of governors to protect their states, to police their streets.  The police power rests at the state level.  And we expect mayors to step up and to do their job, and governors to step up and do their job in the mold of President Trump, who secured D.C. after a night of lawlessness two weeks ago.
Finally, the Defund Police movement is misguided.  It will only hurt the vulnerable citizens of American cities the most.  It’s sad, and it is shameful.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-062220/

1:34 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon everyone.  The great American comeback is underway.  Just before joining you all, we learned from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that unemployment has fallen in 43 states in May, as Americans are going back to work.
Also, I would like to reemphasize the numbers that Director of the NEC Larry Kudlow shared with you all yesterday that the CBO predicted that, in the third quarter, we will get plus-20 percent GDP.  They’ve predicted in Q4, we will be at plus-20 percent GDP.  And top economist Ed Hyman says that, in Q1 of 2021, he is predicting plus-5 in GDP.  And this would put GDP above its 2019 peak.  That’s right.  So pre-coronavirus numbers, should those predictions pan out.  We are back and we will be booming.
Finally — well, second to finally, we are encouraged that we continue to gather positive data on a number of therapeutics.  Heparin, dexamethasone — or steroids, is as it’s more commonly known; convalescent plasma; and remdesivir have all shown promise in treating coronavirus.  Preliminary findings in a large, UK-based recovery trial found that when steroids were used, there was a 30 percent reduction in death for coronavirus patients on ventilators.  The FDA is reviewing this recovery trial data now.
Additionally, on convalescent plasma, there is more encouraging news.  In partnership with Mayo Clinic, the Trump administration moved very quickly on this therapy in its earliest days, recognizing that it showed promise.  Though the — through the FDA, Mayo Clinic, and the administration’s work and our hand-in-hand partnership, we’ve found that this treatment is very promising.  This has shown that the administration has left no stone unturned in looking at every possible treatment at the very earliest stages.
The lead investigator of this Mayo Clinic study, Dr. Michael Joyner, summed up his work, in saying that convalescent plasma, quote, “continues to look promising,” end quote, noting the, quote, “excellent news” of this study, which covered a diverse population of patients.  About 20 percent were African American, nearly 35 percent Hispanic, 5 percent Asian, and 40 percent women.
Prior experience with respiratory viruses in some data that have emerged globally suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness caused by COVID-19.  The results from Mayo underscore that promise.
As you can see, the Trump administration and FDA lead on identifying convalescent plasma as a therapeutic and the results are encouraging.
Finally, I wanted to share some words from President Trump:  Juneteenth reminds us of both the unimaginable injustice of slavery and the incomparable — incomparable joy that must have attended emancipation.  It is both a remembrance of a blight on our history and a celebration of our nation’s unsurpassed ability to triumph over darkness.  That ability is rooted in the fundamental goodness of America, in the truths upon which we, as a nation, declared an end to our status as the subjects of a monarch and emerged as a free and independent people — those truths that all men are created equal by the hand of God, endowed by our Creator with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.

1:15 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Great to join you today.  So, five years ago today, nine innocent parishioners of a historically black church were killed during an evening Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina.  We all remember that tragedy, and this was a despicable act of evil that happened five years ago today.  So we remember that somber day at that Charleston church, as our hearts still break for the victims and our prayers go out to the families.
Yesterday, President Trump led and brought our nation together behind real, meaningful, substantial change to ensure that we have safe streets and safe policing.  Part of that was having an incentive structure to implement the highest professional standards in our police departments through an accreditation process.
This accreditation entails making sure you have de-escalation practices in place, use of force tactics in place.  Part of that is prohibiting chokehold, except in the event where lethal force is used.  It also incentivizes information sharing and makes sure that if they have an officer who’s had multiple uses of excessive force, that that information is sent to a national database.
And then, finally, another prong of this was having co-responders, who are experts in mental health, going alongside law enforcement, because we know law enforcement officials often have to deal with mental health, homelessness, and addiction.  And having a co-responder, who is an expert in this process, will go a long way.
This is project — progress.  It’s tangible action.  And it’s solutions.
And today, Senator Tim Scott said this is “not a binary choice” between supporting police officers and between supporting victims of grave injustices, like George Floyd.  It’s not a binary choice.  There are not sides here.  This is about America coming together.  This is about human decency.  And this is about justice.  And when we see injustices, we recognize them.
As President Trump said yesterday, all children deserve equal opportunity because we are all made equal by God.  That is so true.
First, let me point out that I have sat across from a police officer family that lost their loved one.  I saw a little girl named Charlie, who will forever grow up without a father; who will forever grow up without a father for prom, for the father-daughter dance.  And it was heartbreaking to know that she lost her father, who was a valiant hero.
But yesterday, I sat across from families who lost their loved ones in mass instances of injustice.  And it was heartbreaking to hear their stories.  It was a real tragedy.  It was a tearful moment.  It was an emotional moment.  And it’s one that the President, when I asked him in the Oval Office about it afterwards, he said this: “I love those families.  I want to help those families.”  And President Trump means that.  Because this is about humanity.  That is ultimately what this is about.
And Senator Scott shared a very beautiful Bible verse with those families yesterday, and I just want to read it here, to close.  Romans 8:28: “And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to his purpose.”  He shared that Bible verse with those families, and it was particularly meaningful to me and, I think, to the families, as well.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-061720/

2:48 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, I’m sorry we are very late, you guys.  I’m sorry to keep you waiting.  I was working with the President on something, and he wanted me to hand this out to you all.  And I have it here, so I want to read it to the American public, directly from the President:
“It has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our legendary military bases, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina; Fort Hood in Texas; Fort Benning in Georgia.”  And the list goes on.  “These monumental and very powerful bases have become part of a great American heritage and a history of winning, victory, and freedom.  The United States of America trained and deployed our heroes [here]…and won two world wars.  Therefore, my administration will not even consider the renaming of these magnificent and fabled military installations.  Our history, as the greatest nation in the world, will not be tampered with.  Respect our military!”
So that was directly from the President.  And we spent some time working on that, and I wanted to deliver that to you.
Also, I wanted to take us through a few other things relating to the coronavirus.  First, the coronavirus task force briefing was held yesterday.  I was in it, and there was some very good news that I’d like to share with you.  I don’t know if you all saw; there were two studies that came out — very strong studies — in the journal, Nature.  And in Europe, which had a very similar epidemic profile to the United States, 3.1 million lives were saved due to mitigation and the efforts taken by the European governments.  And as Dr. Birx noted to me — she sent this to me just before I walked out here — she said it suggests that the United States also prevented over 3 million deaths, thanks to the efforts of President Trump and the American people.
Another study found that the shutdown efforts prevented 50 million additional coronavirus cases.  So those are two very encouraging studies underscoring the work of the American people.
Also, the Washington Post noted that these two reports use completely different methods to reach similar conclusions.  They suggest that the aggressive and unprecedented shutdowns were effective at halting the exponential spread of the novel coronavirus.  So thank you, Washington Post, for that good reporting.
The Department of Agriculture, Secretary Sonny Perdue also had some very good news in the task force briefing I was at yesterday.  America’s meatpacking facilities — at one time, it looked like they were going to need to close; that was unacceptable to the administration.  So we took action — the coronavirus task force took action — and now I’m pleased to report that these meatpacking facilities are operating at 95 percent capacity compared to 2019.  We have beef operating at 98 percent capacity, pork at 95 percent, and poultry at 98 percent.
Throughout America’s extraordinary efforts to slow the spread, President Trump ensured that the meat supply chain stayed functional and robust by directing these meatpacking facilities to safely operate in accordance with the CDC and OSHA guidelines.  His efforts secured America’s continual access to a steady food supply chain.
And then, finally, and very importantly, I have some great data points to share on coronavirus testing capacity and minority communities.  Admiral Brett Giroir shared this with me yesterday and last night as well: He said that when we look at testing sites, President Trump’s public-private partnership with retail companies has proven quite successful.  Testing sites are operating in 49 states with 70 percent of these sites located in communities with moderate to high social vulnerabilities.  And social vulnerability takes into account race, ethnicity, housing and economics, language barriers, and other factors.
Also, federally qualified health centers — they’re FQHCs — serve 29 million patients in 12,000 communities across the nation.  They provide care to one in five of those uninsured, one in five rural Americans, one in five of — one in three of individuals below the poverty line, and more than 1.3 million homeless men and women, and nearly a million migrant agricultural workers.  And 92 percent of these FQHCs now offer COVID test.  And we’ve awarded them $583 million to 1,385 of these facilities.
And finally, finally — I promise my last announcement:  The HHS Office of Minority Health issued a competitive funding opportunity to build a strategic network of national, state, territory, tribal, local, and community-based organizations that deliver vital health information and support linkages to services for racial and ethnic minorities.  And this — this announcement — this network is scheduled to be awarded at the end of June and is expected to reach at least 40 million individuals from racial and ethnic minorities.
These updates, I was told by Brett Giroir, were received very well at the Senate hearings.  And we thank the Vice President, Mike Pence, for doing an amazing job leading our coronavirus task force, and to President Trump, who has led in bringing America through the coronavirus pandemic.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-061020/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello everyone.  The transition to greatness has officially begun.  Friday’s jobs report was encouraging, to say the absolute least.  The jobs in this country — we had more than 2.5 million added.  The prediction was that 7.5 million jobs would be lost.  This was a 10 million swing toward the positive side and, in fact, the greatest number of jobs created in a single month on record.  That is extraordinary.  225,000 manufacturing jobs, 464,000 thousand construction jobs, and 1.2 million leisure and hospitality jobs were all added in May.
Beyond that, the number of workers who reported being on temporary layoffs decreased by 2.7 million in May.  And more than that — and this was a great number that was pointed out to me today by the CEA — 300- — 300,000 jobs were created for black Americans in particular.  That’s in May, and that was a 1.7 percent increase.  So very encouraging numbers there from the CEA that they highlighted for me — BLS numbers that they highlighted.
May’s jump in average weekly hours also was an encouraging sign because increasing hours is a sign that employees need to hire — employers need to hire more workers to meet demand.  For all private-sector employees, average weekly hours increased by 0.5 percent to 34.7 hours — the highest level since the series began in 2006.  Seventy-three percent of small businesses are open.  That is up from the 52 percent right before the April jobs report reference period.  Also, workplace visits are up roughly 40 percent from its pandemic low.
The stock market is absolutely soaring.  We saw with the S&P that it had its greatest 50-day rally in history.  The Dow, likewise, is also booming.  The markets clearly have confidence in President Trump — the jobs President who created the hottest economy in modern history once and will do it again.

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  So I’m going to start with a few housekeeping announcements.  First of all, the President’s annual physical results are ready for release.  The full memo will be released shortly.  But in summary, the President remains healthy.
Also, I’d like to congratulate the winners of last night’s primary elections.  President Trump has now endorsed candidates and has a 64 to 0 record in congressional, special, and primary election races since the midterms, demonstrating the strength of and support for the President’s agenda across the country as evidenced in the 64 consecutive congressional, special, and primary elections over the past 13 months.
So, next, I want to transition to talking about some of the things going on around the country.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to riot.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to loot.  The First Amendment doesn’t give anyone the right to burn down buildings.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to deface property.  And it does not give anyone the right to assault private citizens and to assault police officers.
The First Amendment, however, does give you the right to peaceably assemble.  And the greatest example that we have seen of peaceful protest, an absolute embodiment of the First Amendment, is the March on Washington.  On August 28, 1963, a quarter of a million Americans gathered at the Lincoln Memorial and peacefully made a powerful march and a powerful point: that all Americans should be treated equally; that racial discrimination was unacceptable, abhorrent, and that it needed to be rectified.
And in the famous “I Have a Dream” speech by Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, he said this: “We must not allow our creative protest to de”- — excuse me, “to degenerate into physical violence.  Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.”
And soul force is exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. met the nation with when he said this: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”  Important words, important actions from an American hero who contributed to making this nation the greatest on Earth.
With that in mind, we must remember to recognize the lives lost, the passing of George Floyd who was killed unjustly — in a horrific video that we all have seen.  And we must also remember the passing of police captain David Dorn yesterday, who was shot and killed by looters in St. Louis, in an absolute tragedy.  A retired officer, 77 years old, whose wife was also a police officer herself.  Dorn was a hero and an unfortunate casualty in the riots we have seen.  Our hearts are with his family.
We are all Americans.  We must come together.  We must unify.  And we must have law and order.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Weijia.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060320/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  The President has made clear that what we are seeing on America’s streets is unacceptable.  Violence, looting, anarchy, lawlessness are not to be tolerated, plain and simple.  These criminal acts are not protest.  They are not statements.  These are crimes that harm innocent American citizens.
The First Amendment guarantees the right of the people to peaceably assemble.  What we saw last night in Washington and across the country was not that.
To that end, President Trump is demanding action to protect American citizens, to protect American businesses.  Seventeen thousand National Guard are deployed in 24 states, but according to General Milley, only two states have deployed more than 1,000.  There are 350,000 National Guard available overall, and for the lawlessness we are seeing, far more needs to be done.
Governors across the country must act, deploy the National Guard as it’s fit, and protect American communities.  As President Trump has said repeatedly, it’s very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights of peaceful protesters, but we cannot allow a situation like what happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060120/

2:14 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, I want to start by acknowledging the horrific tragedy in Minnesota of George Floyd.  The death of George Floyd is absolutely tragic — that video that we saw, that I saw, that my staff saw, that the President saw.
And the President put out a statement last night that, “At [his] request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd.  I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by law enforcement.  My heart goes out to George’s family and friends.  Justice will be served!”
I can tell you that as I’m briefing you at this moment, the President is receiving a briefing from the Attorney General, Bill Barr, on this and the Deputy Director of the FBI, as that is ongoing on as I began this briefing.
Secondly, I want to transition into some news from SBA and Treasury that was announced, that today, the U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, announced that it is setting aside $10 billion of round two funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to be lent exclusively to CDFIs.  Those are community development financial institutions.  CDFIs work to expand economic opportunity in low-income communities by providing access to financial products and services for local residents and businesses.  So we’re encouraged to see that.
And then, finally, before taking your questions, I wanted to address what has been going on on Twitter and with social media.  I believe it is time to, quote, “get the facts” about Twitter and other social media platforms targeting their bias against President Trump and conservatives online.
If we were to judge the bias of Twitter and its top employees by their own words, the case would be an easy one to make.  Twitter’s head of site integrity has tweeted that there are, quote, “actual Nazis” in the White House, and no fact-check label was ever applied to this absolutely outrageous, offensive, and false claim made against the White House and its employees.
But let’s judge Twitter based on their actions, not based on the words of its top employees.  And its actions are no better.  President Trump recently received a so-called “fact check” label for a tweet.  It was a false fact check, an inaccurate fact check, but nevertheless, Twitter moved forward with it.
Dan Scavino, the Deputy Chief of Staff here, was the first user in the history of Twitter to receive a so-called, quote, “manipulated media” label for posting a video that played a verbatim clip.  It is no coincidence that these two unbelievable interventions by Twitter were targeted against the President of the United States and one of the President’s top advisors.  This is bias in action.
And while big tech is quick to censor the President, quick to censor some of his top employees, they — they are very reluctant, it seems, to label some of the actions by Chinese officials, some of the misinformation that has been spread by China.  For example, to move off of Twitter and move to Google, they created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party, which blacklisted searches for human rights and allowed for easy surveillance.
Facebook and Twitter have both taken paid advertising that spread disinformation about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities.  And Twitter has allowed Chinese officials to use its platforms to spread misinformation about the coronavirus, undermine the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and more.
And then, back in March, a Chinese official began spreading a conspiracy theory on Twitter — an egregious one — that our U.S. military was responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.  And that tweet, that disinformation, it took all the way until today, when we raised concerns about it, to get a fact check.
So they appear to be very hastily eager to censor President Trump and some of his employees but a little reluctant when it comes to China.  It’s a bit befuddling.
But no one believes in the First Amendment more than the President.  The President will take action to ensure that big tech does not stifle free speech and that the rights of all Americans to speak, tweet, and post are protected.
And finally, I just want to note one other action of Twitter that I learned just before walking out here: that, on the Mueller report, their anti-Trump headlines were anti-Trump by a ratio of 76 to 1.  That’s extraordinary.  And it’s not just bias aimed at President Trump and his employees, it’s also aimed at everyday Americans.  It’s aimed at the movie “Unplanned,” as Twitter suspended their account and then came up with an excuse in the aftermath.
And then, just another example that liberals are allowed to incite violence against the Covington kids who were, in the end, proven right and their video was taken out of context, and yet these individuals were led — were allowed by Twitter to incite violence.  It’s very disturbing to see.
So those are some of the President’s concerns.  And with that, I will take questions.
Jim.  That’s a very nice tie, Jim, by the way.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052820/

Also skilled nursing facilities — there was an announcement that I just want to underscore that $4.9 billion in additional relief funds were distributed to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities, and these funds are provided under the CARES Act.
So just those two items for you this morning, and we’ll go ahead and we’ll start with questions.

1:48 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith.  I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they’ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time.
Today, I’m identifying houses of worship — churches, synagogue, and mosques — as essential places that provide essential services.
Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship.  It’s not right.  So I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.
I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now.  If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call.
These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united.  The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque.  Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life.
The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams, and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray.  I know them well.  They love their congregations.  They love their people.  They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else.
The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend.  If they don’t do it, I will override the governors.  In America, we need more prayer, not less.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
MS. MCENANY:  All right, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to join you today.  That was a great announcement from President Trump.  I’d like to introduce Dr. Birx right now.  She has a wonderful presentation pursuant to reopening America, and some great data to share with you.
So I’ll let her kick this off.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  If we can have the first slide, please.
I wanted to start out with a summary of the number of Americans we have lost to date.  But the exciting thing for all of us is the decreasing mortality over time, and I think it both is a real aspect of the amazing healthcare workers on the frontline, the ability of people to share at the frontline how best to care for the patients and the continuous decrease in mortality over time.
Next slide.
The other thing that has decreased significantly over the last month is new hospitalizations.  We can see now that there’s over a 50 percent decline in new hospitalizations.  Although every region of the country is different, we are encouraged to see these new hospitalizations declining.
Next slide.
I’ve talked before about the extensive surveillance that CDC has made available to this country.  This is looking at their syndromic surveillance from emergency rooms.  You can see that both COVID-like illnesses shown in the orange, and shown in the blue, influenza-like illness — taking up both of those cases together — you can see significant declines week over week of number of people coming to the emergency room with these illnesses.  That goes along with our new hospitalizations.
What we like to do is triangulate data, put data together from multiple sources, to see if we’re seeing the same trends so that we can ensure that we’re making progress together.
Next slide.
This is their influenza-like illness surveillance system that has been up and running for more than a decade now.  You can see each of the influenza peaks of this last year.  I think that’s very important to remind people of because we had influenza A, influenza B, and then we had COVID-like illness.  And while we know it’s COVID — that’s the last orange peak — what we really find encouraging is, across the country, we are below baseline.  Why is that particularly important?  Now, these are reported state by state, county by county.  So each county will be able to see precisely where they are.  And then if there is changes in this, it becomes yet again an early alert system.
So I’ve showed you two early alert systems: one of them emergency rooms visits based on our syndromic illness qualifications that the CDC has up on their website, and then the influenza-like illness.  And again, to the American people, all of these are available on the CDC website under “COVID-19 Cases and Surveillance.”
Next slide.
Now, I want to show you — I’m going to go through these very quickly.  This is where we started; this is influenza-like illness, the red.  And the darker the red, the more significant the influenza-like illness is in that state.  So you want to get to green.
So this is the week ending March 28th.  I think many of us can remember what that week was, and this was when we were at the very beginning of our acceleration into logarithmic phase.
Next slide.
This is April 4th.  You’re starting to see some of the states already turn green.
Next slide.  April 11th, more of the country.  Next slide.  April 18th.  Next slide.  April 25th.
Next slide.  May 2nd.  And you can see — and I really call your attention to — there’s a orange area on this slide, and you can see that it’s the Maryland area, and we’ve been calling that out for a while, the high plateau in Maryland.  You can also see Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Next slide.
And then you can see Wisconsin still.  You can see Maryland is yellow.
Next slide.
And I want to turn just a moment, and I know that took you through a lot of slides quickly, but I think we can see, as a country, we have decreasing amount of illness, both at the emergency room and reported through the influenza-like illness.  Two of the surveillance systems at the CDC has up and running.  These come from the states; they come from the counties.  And many of the states have these also on their websites.
We talked earlier about how we had prioritized testing to the area that had the most significant disease.  And you can see now Rhode Island has led all of the states.  It’s almost up to testing 12 percent of all of their citizens.  It’s followed by New York, and you can’t see New York, but that’s the very next one.  New York and then North Dakota.  And so you can see that.  Well, you could.
Yeah, you could see that most of the high-burden areas of the United States had more than 6 percent testing.  That’s when I think you heard from Admiral Giroir we wanted every state to test at least 2 percent of their population during May.  You can see 100 percent of the states now are over 2 percent of their population.  And we’ll fix this slide so you can see every state, but many of the states now are over 4 percent.  And this is just after getting all the materials to ensure that they have adequate transport media and swabs.
So we’re encouraged by the progress that many of the governors and states have made in their testing of their population.  It is also why we took the opportunity to really encourage governors, and it was to encourage governors to test 100 percent of the nursing home residents and staff, because many of our outbreaks that we have seen over the last two months have started in nursing homes.
Next slide.
Now, this is a complicated slide, but this is trying to show you how we triangulate data.  So I took you through our surveillance systems.  I’m taking you now into the start of how we use laboratory data to really understand what’s happening, both in the metros and at the state level.
This is every single state.  And you can see the triangles — the top part that you can see, the little triangle-ly pieces or the diamonds — that is where the states were in the number of positive tests.  This is the nucleic acid test.  This is diagnosing virus in your nose.  You can see where it was 30 days ago and where it is now, by the red squares.
You can see a dramatic decline across the states.  And indeed, New York City, just six weeks ago, was almost 40 percent.  It is now, for the first time, as a New York — as a New York State, under 10 percent.
And so this is the progress that we’re making in both expanding testing, finding more people, but ensuring that we’re getting testing rates of about 10 percent.  This line is 10 percent.  So 42 states are — now have less than 10 percent test positive on a rolling seven-day average.
Now, again, I’m going to call your attention to the top three states — the top three states with the largest percent.  And this is so you can all make your decisions about going outside and social distancing, potentially playing golf, if you’re very careful and you don’t touch the flags and all of those issues; playing tennis with marked balls with just one other person so you’re only touching your ball.  We found, really, people who enjoy sports have been able to really adjust to social distancing.
But you can see the top three states are Maryland, the District, and Virginia.  And so there is still significant virus circulating here.  That is followed by Nebraska, Illinois — because of Chicago — and what we’ve talked about before about Minnesota.  So those are our top states as far as still having high number of test positives.
When I say high number of test positives, they’re all under 20 percent.  If I had shown you this slide four weeks ago, half of the country would have been over 20 percent.  So this also shows progress, but also very clearly about the region we’re living in right now with disease.
Next slide.
Now, I wanted you to see this as a metro, because that’s as a state level.  So we look at this in multiple different ways.  The number one metro with the highest positivity rate is the District of Columbia, which includes Northern Virginia and Maryland — Montgomery County and PG County.  That is followed by Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis.  And so these are the places where we have seen really a stalling or an increase of cases, as in Minneapolis.
You can see all the other metros — all the other metros are almost all exclusively below 10 percent.  So we see this as great progress across the board in the metro areas.
Next slide.
So we also look at daily cases and daily case numbers.  And I know that you all know that that’s a very erratic — and it depends sometimes on how the tests were reported, how the cases were reported, and so you often have to look at it over a three- or seven-day period.  This is looking at daily cases on a seven-day rolling average.  You can see the number one — the top peak that has now come down dramatically — is the New York metro area.
Underneath that, you can see our concerns about Chicago and our concern in the yellow line of the Washington, D.C. area, because these are two areas that went through the logarithmic  phase and are now at a high plateau with an unchanging number of cases day over day.  That’s the orange line and the yellow line.
You can see that the daily case numbers, per hundred thousand, are below the yellow line and the orange line of Washington, D.C. and Chicago.  And that’s New York, Boston, and many of the others.  Providence is also up as a per hundred thousand.  And that’s the way we like to look at it, because we can really then understand it in relationship to population.
The other groups that have very low levels that once had a peak — this is Detroit, a very low level now.  This is Boston in the gray, which has come way down also.  And you can see down here is Atlanta and Miami.
Next slide.
Now, sometimes, and I think recently, there have been publications about where the world was before we started the Stop the Spread and before many states shut down.  And to just to take you back to that moment: On March 14th, before Stop the Spread, this is showing New York.  I didn’t even put March 14th on there because New York, on March 14th, had less than 50 cases reported.  Chicago had less than 10.  Washington had less than 10.  LA had less than 20.  The large state, at that time, that had a significant number of cases was the Washington area — Washington State, which had 100 cases.
On March 14th, we had about 500 cases distributed around the United States, not in any dramatic hotspot per se, but the majority of those cases and the hotspot at that moment was Washington State.  This is how the New York metro area, which includes obviously northern New Jersey, northern parts of Pennsylvania, parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and the dramatic decline that they’ve had in the number of cases.  And I know you know that also mortality has started to decrease in that northern New Jersey and New York area.
Next slide.
But I wanted you to see how we bring all this information together on a daily basis.  The red line in this graphic are the emergency room visits.  So those are the syndromic visits that I discussed with you at the beginning.  The blue line is the test positive.  And again, it’s very erratic because of the reporting of when cases sometimes from the entire weekend are added on a Monday morning.  And then you can see the actual case numbers in the black bars.
And so that’s how we bring everything together.  And what we want to see is all of the — all of the items trending down.  We want to see the number of positives that you find, because we really have states now looking for asymptomatic cases.  So we want to ensure that both asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases are all declining as shown in the blue line; that emergency room visits are declining; and the actual case numbers are declining together.  And of course, then there’s mortality behind that in the green lines that are — green bars that are hard for you to see.
Next slide.
But this is the Washington area.  And so that’s why I wanted you to see that contrast.  You can see there’s not been that dramatic decline in the blue line.  There’s not been that dramatic decline in the black bars of cases.  And there’s not been a dramatic decline in the emergency room visits with COVID-like illnesses.
So even though Washington has remained closed, LA has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases.  And I’ve asked the CDC, and the CDC is working with the local areas in Chicago, in this area, and LA to really understand where are these new cases coming from and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.
Next slide.
This is Chicago.  Again, just to show you going up into this high plateau that has been fairly persistent.
Next slide.
And this is Los Angeles.  So you can get a flavor of where we have concerns, of where cities have remained closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent high number of cases.
Next slide.
So then I wanted to talk to you about outbreaks, because throughout this all, there’s been a large part of America that has been — and many states — that have been really finding their outbreaks, containing those outbreaks by testing everyone, and doing contact tracing, and then stopping them and stopping those outbreaks in their tracks, what we have been talking about everybody being able to do across the United States.
And so this illustrates the counties that have had 100 percent increase in new cases over the last few days — over the last three days.
Now, the reason I wanted to show this is because I see more and more graphics out there that talk about cases going up versus cases going down.
Just to give you an example of Wyoming — and I think many of the groups now have Wyoming as a red state of cases going up.  Wyoming, three days ago, had five cases confirmed and today had — yesterday had nine.  So they qualify, almost, and show up as this large increase.  We — it’s a good alert for us.  We immediately look and look and see what exactly is happening at the state website.
But you can see, when you have very low number of cases, you can have a doubling from 5 to 10 number of cases and show up as 100 percent increase.  And so each of these have to be investigated separately to really understand what this is.  It is the way we find outbreaks in prisons.  It’s the way we have been finding outbreaks in nursing homes.  And we have this graphic.  It goes through all of the counties as well as — next slide.
So this is one state’s analysis.  And what they have shown — and they have been able to find each of their outbreaks, contain every one of their outbreaks, close those outbreaks, and call them closed cases.
In this case, the dark blue is community spread.  The rest of it, 50 percent of their cases, have been coming from outbreaks that they’ve been able to contain.
The largest group in this is meatpacking plants.  And what they’ve been doing is going in and testing 100 percent of the individuals in the meatpacking plant, and also finding 100 percent of the individuals that are associated with those individuals in the meatpacking plant.  They’ve been able to go into group housing, social gatherings.
So just as we discuss all of this, and when you go out for this weekend, Memorial Day, and you want to do some kind of social gathering, it’s very important to maintain that six-feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance cannot be maintained.
But it also talks about long-term care facilities.  Now, interestingly enough, 50 percent of their total cases, since they’ve been tracking, came from these outbreaks.  Almost 70- plus percent — 76 of all their mortality, though, came from these outbreaks.
And this is why we have been really pushing both in the original Opening up America Again, in the testing blueprint.  We talk about proactive surveillance, proactive monitoring and testing in areas that you know are particularly susceptible to outbreaks.
Every state has this knowledge now and this type of analysis.  And so when they have these kinds of analysis, what we’re asking them to do is proactively go and test everyone in meatpacking plants, to proactively go and test 100 percent of the residents and workers, and then a follow-up of the workers in every single long-term care facility.
And this is to find the asymptomatic cases.  I know CDC yesterday released that they thought 35 percent.  We started with the understanding that we thought it was around 11 to 15 percent, based on the experience with one of the Princesses.  But now we know it’s at least 35.  It may be greater than that because it may be so age dependent that there may be a lot of people under 30 that have the virus and are shedding the virus and aren’t aware that they have the virus.  And so, proactive monitoring, proactive testing will become absolutely critical to find these asymptomatic cases.
Next slide.
So this is my last slide.  And this is just to show you what an outbreak looks like.  So if you look at this axis, it’s normalized through 100,000 population.  But you can see — this is what we want to see.  We want to see very low case number.  We want to see that they’ve identified an outbreak, they tested 100 percent, they’ve contained 100 percent, and then they don’t find any more cases.
And so this is what’s happening across the country, county by county — this is a county map — to really show you the work that’s going on.  And since the last two months, we’ve gone from, I think, less than 4,000 contact tracers to nearly 50,000 contact tracers.  And this is what’s been happening behind the scenes.
But I really want to applaud the governors and state and health and local — the health — the health commissioners and the local health departments who have really been working quietly, in an unassuming way, to really find these cases, track these cases, isolate these cases, and ensure there’s no additional spread.  And you can see, in many of these instances, they’ve gone more than two weeks without any additional spread.
And so this is what we are hoping goes across the United States.  Now, we all have to admit, it’s going to be much more difficult in metro areas because you have to really identify where are those asymptomatic cases and how will you find them.  And it’s why there’s been a lot of additional resources go in — going into disadvantaged areas, into the federal community clinics to be able to proactively be able to test for this virus and find asymptomatic individuals.
When someone gets sick with COVID — excuse me — when someone gets sick with COVID, you’ve — you’ve heard the cases; some of them have very high fevers, and so they’re not out walking around.  So they may have been shedding virus for one or two days before they got significantly ill and they had to be in bed because they felt so terrible.
Now, think of that.  They were maybe out two days.  And so if they’re 50 percent of the cases, they’re only out for two of the days that they may be spreading virus.  An asymptomatic individual that doesn’t know they have COVID, they may be spreading and shedding the entire time that they’re in the community.  So instead of two days, it may be six days or it may be seven days.
And so when we talk about proportions, 35 percent that are asymptomatic, that are out in the community, is very — is much more opportunity for transmission than someone who is getting sick and is only out in the community for two days.  And so we know we have to find both, and we’ve been working with states about what proactive surveillance would look like in this case to find people who are asymptomatic.
But it’s also why we continue to recommend to the public, very clearly, that you can’t tell who’s infected.  And so that’s why you have to continue to social distance, that why — that’s why you need to continue to maintain six feet apart.
I remember in the early days of HIV, people told me all the time that they could — they knew who was infected.  And I would say, “You don’t know who’s infected.  I could be infected.  You’re just saying you don’t think I’m infected because I look healthy.”  There’s a lot of healthy people out there with COVID that look healthy.
And so we’re asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend, to play golf, to hike, as Dr. Fauci said, to play tennis with marked balls, and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with, and to even consider sharing social distance space, as long as you have utensils that are — belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately.  There’s a lot of things to think through.  I know you can do this.  I know the American people can do it.
And so, please, as you go out this weekend, understand you can go out.  You can be outside.  You can play golf.  You can play tennis with marked balls.  You can go to the beaches if you stay six feet apart.  But remember that that is your space, and that’s the space that you need to protect and ensure that your social distanced from others.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052220/

3:35 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to begin by detailing the historic private-public partnership effort launched by the Trump administration to combat the coronavirus.  As both a businessman and as President, you’ll all remember then-candidate Donald Trump, now President Donald Trump, being adamant about bringing manufacturing jobs back to America.
President Obama and the Democrats had given up on manufacturing with President Obama’s erroneously prediction that Trump would need a magic wand in order to bring back American jobs.  Not so.
The reality is President Trump revived manufacturing in this country, and he tore up disastrous trade deals that hemorrhaged American jobs, like NAFTA and like the plan that was in work, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Instead, he put in place better trade deals to bring back American jobs and to bring back American manufacturing.
And in the battle against the invisible enemy, President Trump took action to shore up our domestic supply chains in order to deliver the necessary PPE and other medical equipment to the states.
Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are currently promoting a 3-trillion-dollar liberal wish list, among a litany of Democrat priorities immaterial to the coronavirus crisis, are embedded in this, and one would require the President to appoint a, quote, “medical supplies response coordinator” who would, quote, “serve as the point of contact for the healthcare system, supply chain officials, and the states on medical supplies.”
I’m happy to report this individual already exists.  This bill ignores reality, because the medical supplies official is in existence; he’s been working on this since March to deliver, to date, over billions and billions — more than 1 billion, I should say, pieces of PPE to countries and hospitals across the country.
Since March 29th, Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, Vice Director for Logistics for the Joint Chiefs, has been on the job as the head of FEMA’s Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force.  This is a historic partnership with the private sector, and under the leadership of President Trump, FEMA directed the greatest mobilization of the private sector since World War Two.
Rear Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA quickly realized the power of the private sector in addressing the coronavirus, recognizing that the six largest private sector medical distributors would have the ability to source, procure, manufacture, and deliver as many as 1 billion pieces of PPE in a single week.  That is an extraordinary volume by our private sector.  And at the direction of President Trump, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA were able to harness this power.
Every day at 9:00 a.m., Rear Admiral Polowczyk’s team huddles with these six large private sector medical distributors and, together, they review data compiled by Dr. Birx, as well as information provided by the CDC, to set priorities and ensure sufficient levels of supplies go down not just to the county level but to the hospital level.
After focusing geographically, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and his team orients the data to set point-of-care distribution priorities for public hospitals, VA and DOD facilities, private hospitals, nursing homes, acute cli- — excuse me, acute care clinics, first responders, and labs.
In just two and a half weeks, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and his team were able to combine data streams, utilize supply chain visualization tools from DOD, and input data into the cloud.  This system is now available to generate reports for governors showing what their state received from the federal government and commercial partners all the way down to the hospital level, as I noted.
And thanks to President Trump and his administration, governors now have visibility as to where their supplies are sent and where they’re received.  And from March 1st through May 10th, this public-private partnership has led to the delivery — and these are extraordinary numbers — of over 113 million N95 respirator masks, nearly half a billion surgical masks, nearly 18 million face shields, and over 12 billion gloves.  That is a lot of PPE, and we thank our private sector partners for engaging in this effort with us.
Also, I just wanted to note that, earlier today, the President held an hour-long call with thousands of Hispanic community, business, and faith leaders across the country.  He recognized the many contributions of the Hispanic community to our country and addressed important issues, like how to reopen their businesses and build the greatest economy in history again.
And finally, before I take questions, I just wanted to note on a separate note that I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Ravi Zacharias, a renowned Christian apologist who left this world yesterday.  Our prayers are with Ravi’s family during this time.  He meant a lot to a lot of people around this administration.  And as my father said, Billy Graham was the great evangelist and Ravi Zacharias was the great apologist.  And we are all thinking about him and holding him close to our hearts and his family today.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052020/

2:40 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Sorry we’re a little late today.  As you know, the President had two events this morning, so we didn’t want our unprecedented transparency to get in the way of lunch, so we’re glad that you all had a few moments there to eat.  So our delay was hopefully useful and helpful to you guys.
I have an announcement on the Trump administration’s unwavering support for our farmers.  Today, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and senior advisor Ivanka Trump announced the launch of the Farmers to Families Food Box program.  This is a $3 billion program to support farmers and provide food to our most vulnerable communities.  Senior advisor Ivanka Trump and Secretary Perdue are doing very good work.
Now I would like to focus on the Trump administration’s unprecedented coronavirus response.  Some have erroneously suggested that the Trump administration threw out the pandemic response playbook left by the Obama-Biden administration.  What the critics fail to note, however, is that this thin packet of paper was replaced by two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.  So we exchanged this one, which I will hand over to my assistant, Lyndee, for these two pandemic response plans.
In 2018, the Trump administration issued our Pandemic Crisis Action Plan, one of the binders that I just handed to Lyndee.  Further, from August 13th to the 16th, the Trump administration conducted the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise.  This was a pandemic stimulation [simulation] to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak.
In January of 2020, HHS issued the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise After-Action Report.  That was one of the additional documents that I just handed over.  This exercise expounded upon — exposed, rather, the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response, beginning as early as January.  And those legacy planning document shortcomings were, in fact, the papers that I just handed over, that were provided to us by the Obama-Biden administration.
For example, President Trump’s Crimson After-Action Report highlighted that the Obama-era policy directive from November 2016, quote — and I’m quoting from the document — “Does not provide the requisite mechanisms or processes to effectively lead the coordination of the federal government’s response.”  Instead, President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force and put Vice President Pence in charge of the interagency response.  These were effective decisions, and they undoubtedly enhanced our response to the coronavirus.
Furthermore, what Crimson Contagion taught us is that President Trump was right all along about misguided economic and trade policies that left Americans vulnerable to pandemics.
In June 2016 — so, many, many years ago — then-businessman Donald Trump said this: quote, “America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer…I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.  Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.  This is not some natural disaster.  It is politician-made disaster.”  That was then-candidate Trump, who has now implemented those policies as President Trump.
And this forward-thinking vision contrasted with that of President Obama who said, quote, “Trump just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’  Well, what — how exactly are you going to negotiate that?  What magic wand do you have?”  That magic wand was ripping up Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It was ripping up NAFTA.  It was replacing it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a great deal for automakers and our farmers.  And it was ending China’s predatory trade policies and negotiating a historic phase one China deal.  That is what this President has done.
Yesterday, President Trump went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and visited Owens & Minor, Inc.  This was a clear example of domestic manufacturing at work.  You saw this administration taking action to restructure and secure our stockpile of medical supplies.  President Trump released a plan to restructure the Strategic National Stockpile yesterday, and he signed an executive order providing the authority to ensure America is producing critical goods necessary to build up our strategic stockpiles.
The President’s trip was an example of what he’s been saying all along: that America must manufacture, that America must produce, here, in our interior.
Additionally, the President launched Project Air Bridge to bring supplies from all over the world to support America’s frontline healthcare workers.  The administration partnered with the private sector to secure donations and production of PPE and other medical supplies.  And President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act, otherwise known as the DPA, to mobilize our country to manufacture and secure massive amounts of PPE and ventilators.
Through Project Air Bridge, to date, more than 1.4 million N95 respirators have been delivered, as well as 90- — 921 million gloves, 17.1 million surgical gowns, and more.
The Trump playbook and the whole-of-America response to this pandemic has far exceeded what this administration inherited.
And finally, President Trump took action before the pandemic to anticipate and game-plan such scenarios.  President Trump streamlined the National Security Council in 2018 by creating a counter-proliferation and bio-defense directorate.  This directorate combined NSC experts focused on biological threats under a single and more senior leader, and did away with a confusing organizational chart that required some experts to report to two bosses simultaneously.
In short, the NSC retained the same number of experts focused on biological threats that the Obama administration had, but honed them in and focused them more and house them in a more coherent structure and with a more senior leader.
I’d also note that this directorate, which exists today, is the same office that critics allege, to this day, that President Trump eliminated.  I hope in your reporting you are now able to debunk this claim.
Recognizing the seriousness of biological threats, President Trump released a series of strategic documents to transform our preparedness for biological incidents, including pandemics.  In September of 2018, President Trump released the National Biodefense Strategy.  In May of 2019, he released the Global Health Security Strategy.  And in September of 2019, he signed an EO to modernize influenza vaccines.
His leadership is evident in the early days of this pandemic and in the preparation before that.  And these actions I’ve outlined today, these plans I noted, helped us as we approached what was an unprecedented crisis.  It helped us to deploy our resources and to deliver what I believe is the one of the best responses we’ve seen in this country’s history.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-051520/

2:40 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Sorry we’re a little late today.  As you know, the President had two events this morning, so we didn’t want our unprecedented transparency to get in the way of lunch, so we’re glad that you all had a few moments there to eat.  So our delay was hopefully useful and helpful to you guys.
I have an announcement on the Trump administration’s unwavering support for our farmers.  Today, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and senior advisor Ivanka Trump announced the launch of the Farmers to Families Food Box program.  This is a $3 billion program to support farmers and provide food to our most vulnerable communities.  Senior advisor Ivanka Trump and Secretary Perdue are doing very good work.
Now I would like to focus on the Trump administration’s unprecedented coronavirus response.  Some have erroneously suggested that the Trump administration threw out the pandemic response playbook left by the Obama-Biden administration.  What the critics fail to note, however, is that this thin packet of paper was replaced by two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.  So we exchanged this one, which I will hand over to my assistant, Lyndee, for these two pandemic response plans.
In 2018, the Trump administration issued our Pandemic Crisis Action Plan, one of the binders that I just handed to Lyndee.  Further, from August 13th to the 16th, the Trump administration conducted the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise.  This was a pandemic stimulation [simulation] to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak.
In January of 2020, HHS issued the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise After-Action Report.  That was one of the additional documents that I just handed over.  This exercise expounded upon — exposed, rather, the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response, beginning as early as January.  And those legacy planning document shortcomings were, in fact, the papers that I just handed over, that were provided to us by the Obama-Biden administration.
For example, President Trump’s Crimson After-Action Report highlighted that the Obama-era policy directive from November 2016, quote — and I’m quoting from the document — “Does not provide the requisite mechanisms or processes to effectively lead the coordination of the federal government’s response.”  Instead, President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force and put Vice President Pence in charge of the interagency response.  These were effective decisions, and they undoubtedly enhanced our response to the coronavirus.
Furthermore, what Crimson Contagion taught us is that President Trump was right all along about misguided economic and trade policies that left Americans vulnerable to pandemics.
In June 2016 — so, many, many years ago — then-businessman Donald Trump said this: quote, “America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer…I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.  Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.  This is not some natural disaster.  It is politician-made disaster.”  That was then-candidate Trump, who has now implemented those policies as President Trump.
And this forward-thinking vision contrasted with that of President Obama who said, quote, “Trump just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’  Well, what — how exactly are you going to negotiate that?  What magic wand do you have?”  That magic wand was ripping up Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It was ripping up NAFTA.  It was replacing it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a great deal for automakers and our farmers.  And it was ending China’s predatory trade policies and negotiating a historic phase one China deal.  That is what this President has done.
Yesterday, President Trump went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and visited Owens & Minor, Inc.  This was a clear example of domestic manufacturing at work.  You saw this administration taking action to restructure and secure our stockpile of medical supplies.  President Trump released a plan to restructure the Strategic National Stockpile yesterday, and he signed an executive order providing the authority to ensure America is producing critical goods necessary to build up our strategic stockpiles.
The President’s trip was an example of what he’s been saying all along: that America must manufacture, that America must produce, here, in our interior.
Additionally, the President launched Project Air Bridge to bring supplies from all over the world to support America’s frontline healthcare workers.  The administration partnered with the private sector to secure donations and production of PPE and other medical supplies.  And President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act, otherwise known as the DPA, to mobilize our country to manufacture and secure massive amounts of PPE and ventilators.
Through Project Air Bridge, to date, more than 1.4 million N95 respirators have been delivered, as well as 90- — 921 million gloves, 17.1 million surgical gowns, and more.
The Trump playbook and the whole-of-America response to this pandemic has far exceeded what this administration inherited.
And finally, President Trump took action before the pandemic to anticipate and game-plan such scenarios.  President Trump streamlined the National Security Council in 2018 by creating a counter-proliferation and bio-defense directorate.  This directorate combined NSC experts focused on biological threats under a single and more senior leader, and did away with a confusing organizational chart that required some experts to report to two bosses simultaneously.
In short, the NSC retained the same number of experts focused on biological threats that the Obama administration had, but honed them in and focused them more and house them in a more coherent structure and with a more senior leader.
I’d also note that this directorate, which exists today, is the same office that critics allege, to this day, that President Trump eliminated.  I hope in your reporting you are now able to debunk this claim.
Recognizing the seriousness of biological threats, President Trump released a series of strategic documents to transform our preparedness for biological incidents, including pandemics.  In September of 2018, President Trump released the National Biodefense Strategy.  In May of 2019, he released the Global Health Security Strategy.  And in September of 2019, he signed an EO to modernize influenza vaccines.
His leadership is evident in the early days of this pandemic and in the preparation before that.  And these actions I’ve outlined today, these plans I noted, helped us as we approached what was an unprecedented crisis.  It helped us to deploy our resources and to deliver what I believe is the one of the best responses we’ve seen in this country’s history.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-2/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  I want to highlight three critical aspects of President Trump’s response to the coronavirus that have exceeded the media’s expectations and should inspire confidence in every American across this country.  Rest assured the Trump administration is working tirelessly to defeat the invisible enemy.
First, contrary to some media pronouncements, the United States did not need the 1 million ventilators thus far that the media said we were in dire need of.  In fact, it’s encouraging to be able to say that every single American who has needed a ventilator has received a ventilator.  And this administration has managed to pe- — procure, excuse me, 100,000 ventilators to be manufactured in 100 days.  That’s extraordinary.  That’s three times the amount produced in the average year.
Likewise, there was some concern about N95 respirators, but the Trump administration has now shipped over 90 million N95 respirators.  Once again, that is more than three times the average healthcare industry consumption of N95 restorators [sic] — respirators in the typical year.
Finally, the U.S. now leads the world in testing.  For weeks, the media cited South Korea as being the gold standard for testing.  But as it stands, we are now testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea.  And, in fact, as this chart is going to show you, in all 50 states we are now testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea.  So a state in this country is testing at a higher rate per capita than the entire country of South Korea.  That’s pretty extraordinary, I would say.
Now I would like to provide the American people with an update on the Trump administration’s support for underserved communities.  As the President has said, this country is at war with the invisible enemy.  And while we all fight the virus as one united American people, it is a fact that this virus disproportionately has affected those in medically underserved communities, and therefore the President has committed to delivering economic support and quality care for individuals in distressed communities.
The Trump administration, as I announced last week, distributed $12 billion in provider relief payments to 395 hospitals across the country that have been harded [sic] — hardest hit by the coronavirus.  Many of these hospitals were in underserved communities.  And to ensure even more funding to these communities, $2 billion of that overall funding was specifically targeted to hospitals in proportion to the amount of care they provide for low-income and uninsured patients.
Additionally, the Trump administration is investing nearly $2 billion in community health centers to help their 28 million patients in medically underserved areas that receive care and the testing they need.  That’s what this funding is intended for.  And additionally, there’s $583 million awarded to 1,385 health centers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the eight U.S. territories specifically geared towards testing.
These health centers currently provide 100,000 tests per week, and 59 percent of the patients tested last week were from minority communities.
Finally, under the Paycheck Protection Program, the Trump administration has done extensive outreach to the community development financial institution funds across the country.  These are known as CDFIs, and they support revitalization in distressed communities.  In the second round of PPP, 100,000 loans have been distributed to CDFIs and to MDIs, which are known as minority deposit institutions.  These have amounted to about $6.2 billion.
And finally, 570,723 loans have been issued to smaller lenders and non-banks, and these loans have amounted to $29.9 billion.  President Trump will continue to fight for the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of all Americans, especially those impacted in low-income communities and disadvantaged communities.
And with that, I’ll take questions.
Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-051220/

4:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States — the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far.  This afternoon, I’ll also announce new steps that we’re taking to make tests even more widely available.
To battle a virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our nation’s disposal: public, private, military, economic, scientific, and industrial — all at your disposal.  We launched the largest manufacturing ramp-up since the Second World War.  There’s been nothing like it since.
At the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities.  In the span of just a few short months, we’ve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close.  This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America.  And we’re opening, and we’re starting, and there’s enthusiasm like I haven’t seen in a long time.
Every American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill, and enterprise our nation has brought to this challenge.  In three months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States.  Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day.  Now we’re doing approximately 300,000 tests per day — a 100 percent increase — and it will go up substantially from that number.
This week, the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted — nearly double the number of any other country.  We’re testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries — and, in some cases, combined.
On Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen tests, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured.  Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point-of-care test, estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks.
To further expand our nation’s testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration is — and that we’ve got this all approved; it’s all done — is sending $1 billion to America’s states, territories, and tribes.  So this has all been approved.  We’ve gotten it done, completed.  The money is going out.  This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far.
I said from the beginning that the federal government would back up the states and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that’s exactly what’s happened.  This partnership has truly flourished.  We have really had a very good relationship with the states and the governors and other representatives within the states — a relationship like, I think I can honestly say, has not been seen in this country for many, many years.
The governors and us are working together very closely not only on testing, but on ventilators, where we have a capacity that’s, at this point, virtually unlimited.  And we’re sending ventilators — as you probably heard from other countries, we’re sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they’re in tremendous need.  And I think building up a lot of goodwill, but much more importantly than that, we’re saving a lot of lives.
Most states are now doing a great job.  My administration located 5,000 machines in 700 labs across all 50 states, and governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources.
The federal government is also supporting states with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one-on-one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly.
In recent weeks, we’ve held multiple conference calls with every state, as well as with D.C. and Puerto Rico.  We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each state for the month of May, altogether totaling 12.9 million tests.  Think of that: 12.9 million tests.
Today, I’m announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help states meet their targets and meet them rapidly.
During the month of May, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swabs to states nationwide.  We already have them; the delivery will be very quick.  We’re prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any state is on a pace to surpass its goal.  And their goals are very high.  We’ve set them very high, and we’ve told them to set them very high.
My administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing.  A complicated process, but we’ve made it simple.  As a result of these actions, every single state will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in four months since the outbreak began.
This major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher.  Some of these incredible companies produced and produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon.  These are all different products that were literally just developed, and — if you can imagine that.  And these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world.  And other countries are calling us, and we’re trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing.
My administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities.  Through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that’s in addition to all of the other sites that we have working.  Seventy percent of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities.
There will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days.  These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community.  My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy.
In addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90 million N95 masks, and these are of the highest quality — many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn’t have at all at the beginning — 126 million surgical masks — likewise, many are made here; 9 million face shields; 21 million surgical gowns; 993 million gloves; and 10,690 ventilators.  We’re building thousands of ventilators in numerous plants all across our country.  It’s incredible, actually.
This global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people.  It should have never been allowed to happen.  It should have been stopped at the source.  We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one — and that goes worldwide, too.  Many, many countries — 184 countries, at least.
Thanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved.  And we have saved — and if you look at on a per-100,000 basis, we’re at the best part of the pack, right on the bottom.  Germany and us are leading the world.  Germany and the United States are leading the world — lives saved per hundred thousand.
In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task.  We have met the moment, and we have prevailed.  Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.
Day after day, we’re making tremendous strides.  With the dedication of our doctors and nurses — these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors — with the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy, and we will transition into greatness.  That’s a phrase you’re going to hear a lot because that’s what’s going to happen.
We’re going into the third quarter, and we’re going to do well.  In the fourth quarter, we’re going to do very good.  And next year, I think we’re going to have one of the best years we’ve ever had because there’s a tremendous pent-up demand.  It’s a demand — and I’m feeling it.  I’ve felt things a lot over my life, and I’ve made a lot of good calls.  It’s a demand like I don’t think I’ve ever seen.  There’s a pent-up demand.  There’s a — there’s a spirit of this country like few have seen.  And I think you can say — and we’ve helped a lot of the countries a lot.  Really, a lot.  There’s a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing.
But we’re transitioning to greatness, and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter, but it’s really going to be next year, and it’s going to be a year like we’ve never had before.  I really believe that.  As good as we’ve done — and we’ve done great; we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world.  You can talk China, you can talk any other country, we had the best economy anywhere in the world.
And we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers; employment, also, numbers — a little different — where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people.  All of that — we had the greatest stock market numbers ever.  I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time.  A hundred and fifty-two days we set records in the stock market.  We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States.  All of our equipment built — $1.5 trillion plus.
On the southern border, the wall is being built.  It’s being built rapidly.  And now you don’t hear the opponents talking too much about the border.  They don’t like to talk about it because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things.  One of the things we were right about — one of the many things was the border.  We have a very powerful border.  Now, we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border, between the United States and Mexico — our southern border.  We have very few people coming in — very, very few.  Almost record low numbers.
And the wall is being built.  It’s up to 181 miles already.  It’s being built.  It’s being built rapidly.  People don’t talk about it anymore because it’s very successful.  In the area where the wall has built — that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by a very short period of time.  Early next year, we should be up to 450.  And very shortly after that, over 500 miles to be completed.
But it’s had a tremendous impact.  But again, we’ve had the best numbers.  The last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our southern border.  And again, we’re doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers.
So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir — if you could, please come up — and Brad, if you would — Brad Smith.  And they’re going to do a little explaining as to what we’ve done with regard to testing and how successful it’s been.  And then we’ll take some questions after that.
Thank you very much.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration.  And thank you, Secretary Azar, for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I the opportunity to work on this project.
I think it’s clear that America does lead the world in testing.  I’ll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively.  I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem to keep America safe.  And clearly, as we’ve said multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality.
So let’s start potentially with the next slide.
This may be hard to see, but if you look at the line on top, that’s the total numbers of tests done by the United States.  No other country in the world comes close to the total numbers.  Again, as the President has said, today we will top over 9 million tests.  And if you look at per capita — everyone talks about South Korea being the standard — today, we will have done more than twice the per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in South Korea.  No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing.
And how did we get there?  Let’s look at the next slide.  Next slide please.
A very important component of how we came to this point was the authorization by the FDA, under the leadership of our Secretary, of many different diagnostic tests, of diagnostic devices, and now of serology tests.
So you’ve heard a lot about the different testing and you see some of the machines up here.  Most of the diagnostic tests — all but one — rely on the amplification of the viral RNA, the viral genetic material.  And we’ve talked to you about the diversity of tests.  There are very high-throughput tests that are done at big reference labs like LabCorp and Quest.  But very importantly, there are also tests — and you heard us talk about Cepheid, delivering over 2 million tests vitally important to rural America’s — and to places that do not have very large infrastructure.
You’ve also seen the Abbott tests we’ve talked about — there it is on the left of the President — delivering about 1.4 million tests as a point-of-care test.  You get the result within 5 to 15 minutes.  And we have deployed over 235,000 of these tests to the state public health laboratories in every state of this country to make sure that that point-of-care testing capability is there to research outbreaks, like in nursing homes or in certain industrial capacities, and well over 90,000 to the Indian Health Service, so they could test at a point of care in remote locations.
The President also talked about a new first-in-class test; it’s listed there as an antigen-based test.  This is very important — and you’ve heard Ambassador Birx talk about this multiple times — because antigen testing, although complex, is much less complex than the nucleic acid testing that we’ve had.
Quidel had this authorized by the FDA.  And as the President said, we’ll soon be making over 300,000 tests per day.  Do the math.  That’s 9 million point-of-care tests that we will have every month in just a few weeks.  It will clearly add to and, to a certain degree, transform our landscape.
What you don’t see up here is the important work the FDA did.  I’m a swab guy now.  I’m very interested in swabs.  In order to make all these tests work, you have to show that a certain swab, made of a certain material, performed in a certain way, delivers a highly accurate result.
And what you’re seeing up here is some of the fruits of that labor.  Without the authorizations of, for example, the foam nasal swab, we would be blowing through PPE all across the country because of the need for full PPE just to take a test.  That has really been changed by this diverse authorization and a recent authorization that allows the great manufacturer, U.S. Cotton, to join our foundational industry of Puritan.
Next slide.
Last week, we did over 1.9 million tests, and that number is growing.  And again, as the President said and Brad will talk about, our states aspire to do well over 12 million tests over the next four weeks.
You see the graph growing.  What you also see very importantly is that little orange bar on the bottom is the cumulative number of positives.  Our percent positives are going down, and that’s what we want to see.  In fact, in 31 states as of last night, the positivity rate is less than 10 percent, which is not a litmus test, but is a good idea that we’re doing plenty enough testing that we can enter phase one for careful reopening.
I also want to take the opportunity to say this doesn’t happen by accident.  I’m seeing everyone in the audience here, and I’m so pleased that they can be here.  People sitting in the front have been working, literally, 18 to 20 hours a day, every single day of the week, for at least the past two months.  None of this happens by accident.  It happens because their hard work, their sacrifice, their sacrifice to their family all for a common good.  And I’m very, very honored to consider you all as my colleagues.
And my last slide, as the President said, $11 billion are now being announced to be delivered to the states for the sole support of testing.  This will give them the resources to partner, as they have, with the federal government, with the President, the Vice President, the task force, with Brad and I, to achieve their testing goals.  And we’re going to be very specific, and they know it, that there needs to be minimum numbers to be planned to test.  They have to have plans for their vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, including those who are disabled, including those who are in prisons or who have working environments that they may have a more likelihood to spread the infection.
And combined with that, the Secretary’s Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of state, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked to the services that they need — not only testing, but in care as well.
And with that, I’d like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who’s the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together.
Brad.
MR. SMITH:  Thank you, Admiral.  I want to talk through a little bit, specifically the work that we’ve been doing with the states.
So, as the Admiral mentioned, over the past few weeks, we’ve been working with each state to set a target for their testing goal for May.  With — over the series of a couple of different calls, we’ve aligned on what those goals are.  And as the Admiral mentioned and the President mentioned, they add up to over 12.9 million tests in the month of May.
For every state, this is greater than 2 percent of their population in the entire state being tested in May, and for many states, it’s a much higher number than that.  When you compare this, as the President mentioned, to South Korea, South Korea is actually below that 2 percent not for a month, but for their total tests to date since the start of the year.  And so our states have come together to set really ambitious goals that we’re excited to support them in meeting.
If you go to the next slide.  As I talked about last time in the press briefing, there are really three parts to making sure that tests can happen.  The first part is the specimen collection supplies, the second part is the machines, and the third part are the lab supplies that the machines need to run. And what we’ve been working to do is to make sure that each state has all three of those parts to be able to conduct the number of tests.
The first part is the specimen-collection supplies.  The commercial market today is providing a large number of these supplies already to states and already to hospitals, but we wanted to ensure that every state had more than what they needed to be able to conduct the number of tests they’re aiming in May.  So what we’ve done is we’ve purchased enough tests to support the state testing goals for May and June.  So we will be sending more than 12.9 million swabs and over 10 million media to the states over the course of May, and a similar or greater number over the course of June.
In addition, we have several million in reserve.  So if states are able to exceed their goal in third and fourth week of May, we can provide them even more swabs and transport media.  And again, this is in addition to what’s already available on the commercial market.
If you go to the next slide.  There are large numbers that have been talked about many times — a large number of testing machines across the country, over 5,000 different machines that can conduct these tests.  The key part is making sure that the machines and that the labs have enough supplies to run the machines.  There will be, in the month of May, commercially produced, over 25 million test kits, which is either the PCR and extraction kits or the cartridges, to be able to support tests in their effort — states in their testing effort.
And what we’ve been working to do with each state is understand their total goal.  And each of the manufacturers has been a great partner with us and told us how many tests they’re shipping to each lab in each state over the course of May.  And what we know is that, in the aggregate, the number of test kits the state is getting is greater than their testing goal for the month of May.
In addition to what the states have already purchased, there’s over 7 million additional tests that remain unpurchased — the majority of those from Thermo Fisher, which is the most common machine in the country.  So we feel very confident that states will not only have the specimen-collection supplies and the machines, but also the extraction kits and the reagents they need to be able to hit or potentially exceed their testing goals.
And if you go to the last slide.  The last piece of the puzzle is making sure that Americans have access to these tests.  Healthcare providers, hospitals, primary care physicians are already providing these tests today.  And we, for the past six or seven weeks, have been partnering with the retailers who have massively been ramping up their effort.
Today there are over 240 retail sites.  We’ve been working with the retailers to make sure that they’re specifically targeting low-income and other vulnerable communities across the country, and we are talking with them about potentially opening more than another thousand additional sites over the next month or two.
So we hope that we’ve put together the right pieces of the puzzle: having access points for patients and Americans across the country, having the specimen-collection supplies needed to take the test, having the machines, and then also having the lab testing supplies with the machines.
So, thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Brad.  And maybe you’ll both stay there.  Could be some questions.
Okay.  Please, John.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-covid-19-testing/

12:38 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon.  Today marks the 75th anniversary of VE Day, a triumphant milestone in our nation’s history and indeed in world history.  Seventy-five years ago today, our brave American forces defeated fascism in Europe.  And through the selfless devotion of thousands of patriots, they saved the world.
Over 180,000 Americans gave their lives in the European theater during World War Two.  And I want to take just a moment to honor their service and their sacrifice.  Thank you to all of our veterans.  You are truly, truly our heroes.
Now, as I move to my next subject, I want to begin by saying this: Look, our rank-and-file men and women at the FBI are heroes in their own right.  They protect this country from domestic crime, and we thank them for their service.  They work hard.  And once again, we owe them a debt of gratitude.  But that is separate and apart from what I’m about to address right now.
The FBI exists to investigate crimes.  But in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, it appears that they might have existed to manufacture one.  As the motion filed by the Department of Justice yesterday explained, the FBI set out to interview General Michael Flynn, when they had no predigate [sic] — predicate for any investigation of any crime.
Over the past week, we learned, from a handwritten note, the true intent behind the FBI’s investigation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.  The very day that then-FBI Director Jim Comey sent agents to the White House to interview Flynn, the FBI discussed what their intent was beforehand.  This is what they said: “What is our goal?  Truth, admission?  Or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”  These notes, in addition to other evidence, raise serious questions about the handling of the — of the FBI’s handling of Michael Flynn’s case.
Did the FBI confront Flynn with the intent to get him to lie so that we can prosecute him and fire him?  Did the FBI manufacture a crime against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn?
Federal investigators appear to paint a target on the back of General Michael Flynn.  Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal laid out, point by point, the very concerning aspects of this case, and I’m going to reiterate them as outlined in her column over the weekend:
In December 2016, Flynn spoke as the incoming national security advisor to the Russian ambassador.  This call, as is customary, was recorded by the United States government.  They record calls with foreigners.  But in a highly irregular move, the intelligence community, under the Obama administration, unmasked the identity of Michael Flynn, a United States citizen, who is entitled to Fourth Amendment rights and to due process.  But Lieutenant General Michael Flynn received none of that.
The intelligence community was hunting for evidence against General Flynn — evidence they did not find.  We learned from newly released transcripts that in stark contrast to what former DNI James Clapper had been saying publicly, and contrary to what he was saying publicly, here’s what he was saying privately with regard to Russian collusion: “I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting [or] conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.”  Sounds awfully different from what he just said 10 days prior in a public capacity.
Having found no evidence of Russian collusion, the FBI came up with a new absurd theory that Flynn might have violated the Logan Act, a statute from 1799 that, in its 200 years of existence, had never been used to convict an American citizen, but it was resurrected in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.
Michael Flynn didn’t violate the Logan Act.  Even the FBI did not think that General Flynn’s telephone call provided the predicate for a criminal investigation.  In fact, in January of 2017, an internal FBI document concluded that Flynn was, quote, “no longer a valid viable candidate for investigation.”  Disgraced FBI agent and noted Trump hater, Peter Strzok, disagreed, texting this: “Hey, if you haven’t closed that Flynn case yet, don’t do so yet.” End quote.  So the Flynn case remained active.  This was a good thing for Peter Strzok, but it was a bad thing for justice.  It was a bad thing for the rule of law.
According to yesterday’s motion to dismiss the case against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, it said this: Mr. Strzok immediately relayed the, quote, “serendipitously good” news to Lisa Page, special counsel at the FBI, remarking, quote, “our utter incompetence actually helps us.”  That’s right.  Their utter incompetence to close the case against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was something to be serendipitously celebrated.
The scheme to manufacture a case against Michael Flynn continued.  After President Trump entered office, the FBI’s partisan pursuit of General Flynn proceeded under Jim Comey’s FBI.  Despite possessing a transcript of Flynn’s entire conversation, the FBI decided it was somehow necessary to go ask General Flynn what happened on the call, despite having a transcript in their possession.  The only motive would have been to, quote, “get him to lie.”
They advised him he didn’t need a lawyer present.  Imagine that: “You’re an American citizen.  You don’t need a lawyer.  We’re just coming in to have a chat.”  They didn’t inform their superiors at the Department of Justice about their intent to interview Flynn, despite their own attorney at the FBI saying, “If we usually tell the White House, then I think we need to do what we normally do.”  But they ignored the advice of FBI counsel, and they went in to interrogate Michael Flynn.
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, no fan of President Trump, said she was “flabbergasted.”  She was “dumbfounded” by the decision to not inform DOJ officials who, quote, “hit the roof.”  This is all outlined in a legal document that you can find.
Additionally, when the FBI arrived at the White House, they did not even warn lawyer-less Flynn about the consequences for providing an inaccurate response.  The interrogation of Michael Flynn was not an inquiry.  Make no mistake: It was a trap.  Even more troubling was the fact that after the interrogation of Flynn, former Deputy Director of the FBI Andy McCabe concluded that he, quote, “didn’t think Flynn was lying.”  But the case against Flynn continued.
We were pleased to learn yesterday that the Justice Department moved to drop the case against General Michael Flynn.  Though it took several years, it is encouraging to see that justice finally prevailed.  As we move forward as a country, it’s important to take these revelations very seriously in order for Americans to have faith in our justice system.
If the top leadership of the FBI can target a three-star general who served this country for three decades, make no mistake, they can target you.  It’s hard to believe that this happened in the United States of America.
General Michael Flynn’s life was forever changed.  He had to sell his home.  He faced financial ruin.  His family was even threatened with prosecution.  But despite all of that, here’s what Michael Flynn put out yesterday in his first reaction to the motion to dismiss.  If we can play the video, let’s go ahead and play it.
I don’t think we have the video queued, but I encourage you all to go on General Twynn’s [sic] — Flynn’s Twitter feed, and what you’ll see is a really beautiful video of his grandson talking about how much he loves this country and how everyone deserves justice for all.  And how commendable that is for General Flynn, at a time when he was so gravely wronged to say this: I still believe in this country.  I still believe in America.  I still believe in the principles that make this country the greatest on Earth.
And in the words of renowned political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu, “There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and in the name of justice.”
I hope the media will take these questions very seriously, will report the facts.  There was heavy interest in the first iteration of Flynn news from many years ago that got four times the coverage that the exoneration of Michael Flynn got today.  That was a report by Media Research Center.  So these facts are important, and thank you very much for those who have taken interest in reporting.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-050820/

4:32 P.M. EDT

MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to direct your attention to a very encouraging graph regarding test results.  It’ll be over my shoulder and hopefully on the screen for those of you watching on television.  As this chart shows, the United States has, to date, completed 7.5 million coronavirus tests.  It’s an extraordinary number.  And, as you can see, the United States leads the world in testing. 

This graph is no accident.  In fact, this graph is a testament to American innovation, including the work of the Trump administration.  For example, the FDA has issued over 70 emergency use authorizations to expand testing capacity to accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  There are nearly 80 clinical trials ongoing with an additional 30 clinical trials expected. 

This graph is also a testament to the American people who have been — and it’s no exaggeration — American warriors, as they’ve followed social distancing guidelines and taken steps to ensure that the health and safety of our vulnerable populations is protected. 

Finally, I would like to note that this graph indicates that the U.S. has conducted double the number of tests conducted in other countries.  The U.S. is providing leadership during this crisis, not only leading the world in testing, but also taking steps to help allies around the world — steps we are able to take only because of this country’s incredible ingenuity and work ethic. 

As you’re well aware, President Trump has consistently sided with the experts and has always prioritized the health and safety of the American people.  This includes issuing guidance that meant hardworking Americans had to stay home, social distance, and slow the spread of the virus.  The hard work of Americans saved many lives, and we salute the great citizens of this country for your hard work. 

As Americans across the country stayed home and businesses temporarily shut their doors, President Trump ensured American employees and employers would receive the help that they needed.  The Paycheck Protection Program provided forgivable loans to small-business owners who kept their employees on payroll. 

To date, 2.3 million small-business loans have been processed, with the average loan being $76,000.  In other words, meaning that the small businesses that needed the help the most got it.  I would remind everyone that, of the 1.6 million loans given out in the first tranche of spending, one million of those went to businesses with 10 or fewer employees.  So it truly has gone to those who need it most. 

Joe Shamess is a small-business owner.  Joe, with his co-founder Brian Steorts are two veteran special operators in the military who started Flags of Valor in 2015.  It’s a veteran-owned, veteran-run manufacturing company located not too far from here in Virginia. 

Flags of Valor builds wooden flags, among other products.  They’ve employed, over their years, 65 veterans and have raised over $1 million for veteran charities.  Flags of Valor is also proud to have 97,000 hours of American manufacturing labor under their belt.  That’s a lot of hours. 

At the start of this crisis, Joe had to furlough four of his employees, in addition to imposing a 50 percent pay cut.  His employees were, of course, disappointed but they were, quote, in his words, “all in,” in the fight against the coronavirus. 

Everything changed for Joe and his furloughed employees when he applied for the PPP loan.  Just this week, he was approved for that PPP loan that enabled Flags of Valor to rehire its furloughed employees and to boost paychecks back to pre-coronavirus levels.  “PPP was a huge lifeline for us,” Joe told me.  He called it a lifesaver. 

This is a perfect example of why President Trump fought for additional PPP funding and will continue to fight for small businesses and American heroes like Joe.  Joe is here with me today, and I’d like to invite him to come up. 

Joe, thank you so much for your service.  Thank you for all the great work you’ve done for our veterans and being a veteran yourself.  I wanted to see if you’d take to the podium for a minute or two and share your message of hope with the American people. 

MR. SHAMESS:  I’d love to.  Thank you, Kayleigh, and thank you, President Trump, for allowing me to be here today.  I’ve got a couple props.  This is examples of one of our products that we make, and here’s another one.  This one, my son Gabriel made. 

And when — when you talk about hope and what’s going on, it’s a — it’s a challenging time for small business.  We lost two-thirds of our revenue like that.  Gone.  And so trying to get that back, and when you think about a small business that generally is running maybe it’s 10 to 20 percent profit margin, two-thirds is a killer. 

And so when you think about the Paycheck Protection Program, the two biggest fixed costs for most businesses is people and property.  And that’s exactly what the PPP focused on. 

So, for us, it was a lifesaver.  It was an absolute game changer.  We went from trying to figure out how we were going to limit our cash burn every single day to stay alive as long as we could, with as many people as we could, to finally bring them back.  And when you have to furlough someone, I’m telling you, it is one of the worst things you can do because you’re talking about family.  These are people.  These are their — their wives, their husbands, their children.  They’re a part of your ethos. 

And so what we’ve experienced has been challenging, sure.  But when there hasn’t been all the revenue, there’s been people helping other people.  And the way we approached it was, how can we be better?  How can we exit COVID-19 a better version of ourselves?  How can we innovate? 

And so we saw people like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the SBA step in.  We saw our partners at Under Armour step in.  We saw innovation — you see companies making respirator masks.  You see all kinds of stuff going on.  And we created the flag boat kit because families were at home with their kids.  They didn’t know what to do with their children.  And we believe this is our nation’s family crest.  So, what better thing than allow families to build American flags together and talk about that and what it means? 

And then we started a twice-a-day, daily pledge at 9:00 a.m. in the morning on the East Coast and again at 9:00 a.m. on the West Coast.  Every day we’ve got thousands of kids and their families joining us to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  It’s phenomenal.  And all that’s happening by people coming together, by people thinking and innovating. 

And — and I can’t tell you enough how grateful we are to the U.S. government, the bipartisanship that took place to pass the Paycheck Protection Program.  It was all hands on deck.  It wasn’t like — there was no script for this.  And they built the parachute on the way down. 

And when you think about it, you want to talk about the Lakers got it or somebody else got it — think about the millions of businesses that are being benefitted by this.  And it’s, I think, 47 percent of U.S. private-sector employees are in small businesses.  They work for small businesses. 

And so, all the big businesses we love, they started as small businesses.  And I hope to be a big business someday, but for now, I’m happy to be alive.  I’m thankful for your support.  And thank you, Kayleigh, for letting me be here. 

So, join us at FlagsofValor.com.  Thank you. 

MS. MCENANY:  Joe, if you want to take a seat with the reporters, you can ask me some questions. 

MR. SHAMESS:  I’m happy right here.

MS. MCENANY:  Joe, it’s veterans like you that make our country great.  It’s small-business owners like you that are going to bring this country back.  And employees like the one we heard from last week — Michael Heup, the employee of Bitty & Beau’s Coffee — that keep this country going.  So thank you so much for the example you’ve set and to the hardworking business owners across the country, to the employees across this country who are working during this time.  So, thank you, Joe.  Thank you for your service.

As I said, PPP has changed lives across this country.  And as President Trump has said, the American people are warriors and we will fight together to defeat the invisible enemy.

2:11 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, good afternoon.  I have an announcement for you on hospital funding as appropriated in the third phase of coronavirus relief.
The Trump administration will distribute a total of $12 billion in Provider Relief Fund payments to 395 hospitals across the country that have been hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These hospitals have collectively cared for over 70 percent of the 184,000 Americans that required hospital inpatient care.  Ten billion of the twelve billion will go towards hospitals treating 100 or more COVID-19 admissions.  HHS is distributing an additional $2 billion to these 395 hospitals in proportion to the amount of care they provide to low-income and uninsured patients.
This is consistent with our effort to ensure that Americans who need federal government assistance the most receive it.  We’ll be releasing a breakdown of the states receiving this funding and the counties receiving this funding.  But for your awareness, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois received the most funding by states, while New York, New York; Bronx, New York; and Cook, Illinois received the most funding by county as determined by our metrics.
Our healthcare providers, as President Trump has repeatedly acknowledged, are our heroes as we work to defeat the invisible enemy.  This relief funding will help these heroes defeat this virus.  In reacting to CARES relief, I love what this one provider said.  So he said, “Thank you and God” — “Thank you and God for this relief.  I have tears in my eyes out of gratitude for these funds.  Thank you so, so, so much.”
Additionally, 100 flights as part of Project Airbridge have been completed to date.  These flights have expedited nearly 1 billion pieces of PPE for our healthcare heroes.
The third phase of coronavirus relief also included $320 billion in additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, which, as you all know, provides forgivable loans to small businesses in order to keep their employees on payroll.
This program has been extraordinarily successful during the first round of PPP loans: 1.6 million loans were issued to small businesses.  Of those 1.6 million loans, 1 million of them were given to companies with 10 or fewer employees.  So it has gone to small businesses and businesses that need it most.
But the PPP — look, it’s not just another government program.  This is supporting everyday Americans who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves in this predicament.  We saw this firsthand at the White House on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, President Trump welcomed small-business owners and employees to the White House.  These small businesses received PPP loans, which helped them pay their employees during the pandemic.
Bitty and Beau’s was among the small businesses welcomed to the White House.  Bitty and Beau’s employs 120 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  It’s a coffee shop not too far away from here.  Bitty and Beau’s had to temporarily close its doors, but because of PPP loans, Bitty and Beau’s was able to rehire all of its employees.
I had the real honor of getting to meet Michael Heup.  He’s one of the employees at Bitty and Beau’s, and he offered some words of encouragement to our country.  And they really touched my heart, and I think they’ll touch the heart of America, if you guys wouldn’t mind playing those remarks.
(A video is played.)
Michael is an incredible young man.  I gave him a call yesterday and asked him what he was up to, and he said he and his fellow employees were literally handwriting notes to put in with their coffee packages that they send out to consumers.  I received one of these notes from another company, and it really does put a smile on your face.  And Michael is doing that each and every day.
And Bitty and Beau’s, they represent the hope and opportunity that is on the horizon for America’s workers as their body, their — their business, rather, embodies the American spirit.  Workers, like Michael, show that this country is not broken and that we will recover together.
Michael, thank you.  You’re an American hero.  Thank you for sharing that message of hope.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany/

5:38 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today I’d like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus.  Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens — we’ve had such tremendous support all over — we continue to see encouraging signs of progress.
Cases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining.  Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St. Louis are all stable and declining.  All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better.  In all cases, getting better.  And we’re seeing very little that we’re going to look at as a superseding hotspot.  Things are moving along.  Really, a horrible situation that we’ve been confronted with, but they’re moving along.
As we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains, however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy.  We grieve by their side as one family — this great American family.  And we do grieve.
We also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus.  We’re doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually re-open our nation, and to safely get our people back to work.  They want to get back to work, and they want to get back to work soon.  There’s a hunger for getting our country back, and it’s happening, and it’s happening faster than people would think.
Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation.  These goals work in tandem.  They work side by side.
It’s clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives.  For those who are infected, we have taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world.  The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment, as you know — in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it; some of our greatest executives — some of the greatest anywhere in the world — and distributed over 10,000 ventilators.
And we now have, in a very short period of time — many have been delivered, and hundreds of thousands are being built.  And frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with.  They’re actually shipping them to different locations, and we’re shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world, because we have ventilators like — the job that they’ve done in getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible.  You don’t hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way.
We’ve launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise, on Earth.  The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests — nearly double the number tested in any other country.  More than twice as much as any other country.  Think of that.
Moments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger.  We’re joined by leaders of those great companies.  And we also have with us the leaders from the world’s top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers: Thermo Fisher, LabCorp, Quest, U.S. Cotton, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association.  These are great — great companies.
These private-sector leaders, along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic, and Cephe– Cepheid, have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the states’ capabilities and our country’s capabilities.  The job they’ve done has been incredible.  The testing that’s been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing.
I want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they’ve done.  I want to thank Roche.  And in particular, those two have really stepped forward.  Abbott with a five-minute test that people can take, and in five minutes they know what the — what the answer is.
I’d like to ask, if I could, the executives of these great companies — and they are — they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period.  We’re talking about a 45-day period when many of us met.  And since then, what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing.
So I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company.  Plus, they’re going to make a big contribution to our country.
Please.  Come forward, please.  Thank you.
MR. RUSCKOWSKI:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for — all of you for being here today.  And what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made.
The last time we were here was March 13th, and we’ve made tremendous progress.  And none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock, working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need.
As far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress.  We are currently, at Quest Diagnostics, testing about 50,000 tests per day.  We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number by the end of May.  We’ll have 100,000 tests per day — about 3 million tests — and these are the molecular tests that we do today.
We have also brought up serological testing.  We started that this past week, and by the end of May, we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month.  So you put those two numbers together, and it’s about 10 million tests by the end of May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics.
We’re doing that also in a quicker way.  Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue in the early days.  We’ve reduced that to one to two days.  Our turnaround time for people in beds — hospital beds — is less than 24 hours.  And we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA, delivering the quality that you all expect.  And convenience will improve, as well, with convenient solutions that we’ll be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer — the ability to have consumers choose a test online with a telehealth provider.
So with that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
MR. SCHECHTER:  Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today.  Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible.
Just 45 days ago, we said we could do several thousand tests a day.  We can now do 60,000 tests a day, and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.
In addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier.  We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test.  That test, right now, is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks, and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers.
At the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing, and we can currently do about 50,000 today, and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May.  And we’re going to be working with the retailers — our colleagues that are here today — to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country.
And lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development business, and we will continue to work with our colleagues in the pharmaceutical and the biotech — biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Please, go ahead.  Please.
MR. CASPER:  Mr. President, thank you and thank — and thank the administration for all of the collaboration to enable Thermo Fisher Scientific to be able to produce the test kits that companies like LabCorp and Quest and the public health labs around the world run.
We met our original commitments of producing 5 million kits a week, and we’re up to scaling that to double that in the coming weeks in terms of supporting testing around the world.
I’d like to thank my 75,000 colleagues around the world for their tireless effort to make that a reality and supporting all of — all of our customers to have the testing necessary to get America back to work.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
MR. NIMS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m John Nims with U.S. Cotton, and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits.  We have about 1,200 people in our company.  And in our Cleveland operation, they have pivoted from, as you’ve said, the Q-tip-style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits.
Our Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this, and I’m very — they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort.
So thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
MR. MERLO:  Mr. President, thank you.  I’m Larry Merlo with CVS Health.  And it was just over a month ago that we opened up our first drive-through test site.  And since that time, we have opened large-scale testing facilities across five states in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, and Michigan.
And these sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with real-time results.  We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week.  And this afternoon, we announced plans to expand that capacity even further.
Beginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to 1,000 CVS pharmacies.  We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing.  So again, you’ll see that coming online, you know, in May.
And we also recognize the fact that the virus is disproportionately affecting our minority communities.  So we’re working in partnership with organizations like the National Medical Association to bring testing and care into the traditionally underserved communities.
We’re also beginning to implement mobile capabilities with which to do that.  And as businesses are restarting their workforce, we’ll also be looking to assist them, you know, as they begin to come back to a normal operation.
And finally, as my other colleagues, I just want to thank my CVS colleagues.  They have done a phenomenal job in terms of helping people in many different ways all across communities in the country.  And they’re part of this army of healthcare professionals and, you know, front-store and, you know, first-line supervisors and workers that are doing terrific things to bring our country together.  And, for that, we owe them a huge amount of gratitude.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.
MR. ASHWORTH:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Appreciate the invitation to be here today.  And it was just 45 days ago when we were here.  I’m Richard Ashworth.  I oversee Walgreens in the U.S.  And I just want to start off — Larry, like you — thanking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers — you know, giving them essential daily needs; the prescriptions, obviously, that they need; and even COVID testing while we’re here.
We also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all states, including Puerto Rico.  We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now, in partnership with our lab partners, and we’re excited to be able to do that.
We’re really excited with the public-private partnership that we have here, because that’s what’s enabling us to do this, and we look forward to working with the additional states to get these sites up and running as fast as possible.
As a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing: I’m really proud to be part of this profession.  And not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them, across grocery — mass, independents.  You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for: to help patients, counseling them on their medicines, and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing.
You know, pharmacy is right here in it with everyone, together in the community, and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now; serology, whatever that might look like in the future; and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come.
So thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you very much.
MR. ASHWORTH:  Thank you.
MR. MCMULLEN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  We appreciate all you’re doing to get America back to work and doing it safely.
I represent Kroger, and my name is Rodney McMullen, and I am so proud of our nearly half a million associates that are doing everything, every day, to keep customers safe and our associates safe.
And one of the things that we were able to do is provide the basic practices we’re doing.  We call it “blueprint.”  And it’s the things that all of us can learn from on how to get America back working.
We also announced earlier today, continuing to accelerate our practice on testing.  We are actively engaged in six states.  Next — in the next couple of weeks, we’ll take that to 12 states, and the number of tests that we do continues to grow faster than that.
Together, we will win.  Together, we will solve this problem and move on.  America is always great.  Thank you again.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
MR. MCMILLON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My name is Doug McMillon.  I’m a Walmart associate.  And I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our stores, Sam’s Clubs, distribution centers, and in our e-commerce fulfillment centers.  They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can-do attitude and step up.  It’s much appreciated.
We started 45 days ago, as did everyone else, and we’ve been operating sites for a while now.  We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 states.  By the end of next week, we’ll be to 45, and by the end of the May — end of May, we’ll be at 100.
We also — a few weeks ago, Vice President Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia — a food distribution center.  He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated.
And the President and Vice President were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns, and the President asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns.  And we don’t normally buy those, so I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that.  But I’d like to thank our apparel team, and McKesson in particular, for partnering with us.  We’ve been able to, in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns.  And by the end of May, we’ll have an additional 6 million available to help.
So thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doug.  Great job.  Thank you.
MS. DONIGAN:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country.  I’m Heyward Donigan with Rite Aid.  And we are currently operating 40 percent of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight states.
And we had the — I had the opportunity, as I was driving up, to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates — whether it be security or pharmacy front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much.  It was really amazing to see.
And I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times.  It’s been quite amazing.  And we too are going to expand our testing, and we’re doing about 1,500 a day.
Thanks.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
So thank you all very much.  It’s incredible what we’ve done together over a short period of time.  I want to thank our Vice President for the task force and the work.  Every day, it gets better.
And we had a fantastic goal with the governors today, and I would say that they are as — as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country.  It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way.  And the whole world is suffering because of it — 184 countries at least.
But I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they’ve done.  They have been fantastic with us, working with us.  And, as you know, for several weeks, my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in states.  Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity.
Then, one week ago, we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their states.  Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket.
On Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number — bigger than any country anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time; a number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day.  So we much more than doubled it, and that will be doubling again very shortly.
We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening.  And the reopening process — we want to get our country open.  And the testing is not going to be a problem at all.  In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.
Today we’re releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the states as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening.  Our blueprint describes how states should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks, and conduct contact tracing.  We have it all.
Other countries are calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it.  And we’re helping them.  We’re dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing, just like we did on the ventilators.
I directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need.  And the pharmacies — as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing.  And we have other testing locations that we’re going to be allowing also, but having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal.  We’re also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program.  So they’re going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid.  So it’s a big — that’s a big deal.
So we’re deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help states, cities — to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast.  There’s tremendous energy in our country right now.  There’s energy like people haven’t seen in a long time — a spirit that they have not seen.  And we’re doing very well — very well — considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others.
This is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time.  You can probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time.  You all know what happened in 1917.  That’s over 100 years ago.
With that, I’d like to introduce, if I might — Dr. Birx, if you could come up.  And then, Admiral, you’ll come up.  And between the two of you, you’ll explain the entire process and how much progress we’ve made and where we’re going.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  So the blueprint lays out the roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private sector and the public sector, bringing together state and local governments with the federal government to ensure that we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives.
If we can have the first slide.  The core elements of the testing plan include both three elements: robust diagnostic testing plans developed in partnerships with state — and I just really want to thank the governors and the health officials, both at the state and local levels who have been working with us day and night to work through these issues, and also all the laboratory directors in many of those states, as well as the American Society for Microbiology, who have been working with us to ensure that the plans were efficient and effective.
Within the robust diagnostic testing plans, it was really unlocking the full capacity of the state: increasing the number of testing planforms — we now have multiple tests for different platforms; increasing the ability to collect samples; increasing testing and laboratory supplies; and ensuring that we work together to make sure that every client receives the test that they need.
This is added with timely monitoring systems.  And what do I mean by that?  Systems where we bring together the ability to not only diagnose the symptomatic, but proactively and interactively work with individuals that we know are at higher risk.  We’ve worked with states to look at where the outbreaks have occurred when they’re not in the large metros, and we see that it occurs very often in places of close settings, among our Native Americans and among our long-term care facilities.  So an active monitoring program that’s active, integrated, and innovative.
And then combining this with the third element, which is the rapid response program, relying on CDC to be working with state and local governments to ensure that every symptomatic case — and, critically, the asymptomatic cases — are quickly tracked and traced to ensure that we can not only control this epidemic, but predict outbreaks before they expand.
And then, finally, the plan includes an approach of using science and technology to develop even newer platforms, more efficient testing, really ensuring that the antibody tests that are utilized and recommended by both FDA and CDC have high quality and predicting both exposure to the virus and antibody development.
And then, finally, working on innovative tests that could be high throughput and point-of-care — an antigen-based test or a point-of-care expanded nucleic acid test.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you.  Good job.
Admiral, please.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you, Ambassador Birx.  If I could have the next slide, please.
I want to spend just a couple minutes about telling — going over where we’ve been, but more importantly where we’re going.  I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct phases.
First is our launch phase, when we were really engaging the emerging epidemic and the types of things we need to do.  For example, mobilize the private sector to develop tests and have EUAs.  And I think you know, over the past two months, the FDA has issued 67 emergency use authorizations, which is far outpacing anything that has been done or could ever have been imagined.  Galvanizing the research community and the commercial labs — the reason why we’re here with ACLA labs, having done about 3 million tests, is because of that day when it was galvanized by the President and the Vice President.
We also set models in the community.  Those first community-based testing sites that were federally supported and, really, under the direction of the U.S. Public Health Service — people who had been in Japan, testing people on the Diamond Princess, to assure that it would be done right and it would be done safely for everyone involved.
Then we moved to, really, scaling.  That phase was very, very important because we knew we needed to be at an immense scale to enter the third phase about supporting opening again.  This again — for example, a lot of my life is about swabs.  It was enhancing the production capability of a small company in Maine, called Puritan, that you’ll hear a whole lot more about that has — that is, sort of, the swab provider for the country — but also, because of the FDA actions and the actions of scientific community, being able to broaden the types to spun polyester, so U.S. Cotton can now come in and start delivering, within the next couple of weeks, 3 million swabs per week of a different type.
It also did things like expanding the community-based testing sites.  Whereas we started small with the commercial partners, you see today, right now, we have 73 of these 2.0 sites going to 110.  And very importantly, this demonstrated the model.  And 68 percent of those sites are in communities of moderate or high social vulnerability.  And 22 percent are in the highest social vulnerability communities so that we can make sure that testing gets where it needs to be.  You’ve just heard that that could be expanded to thousands of sites.
And finally, stage three, which is very exciting: coordinating with governors to support testing plans and rapid response programs.  Over the past week, a multidisciplinary team from the White House, HHS, FDA, FEMA has met virtually with multidisciplinary teams from every state, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to understand what their testing aspirations are and to make sure that we can meet those demands.  We’re going to have another round of those calls this week.
But as we talked about earlier today, we will be able to supply every state with the — with the supplies and the tests that they need.  That will dramatically increase the number of tests we’ve done to this point.  And just to give you an idea, the supplies that we will be providing to states — the minimum that we’re supplying to states is approximately double, in that month, than the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months to now accumulated — to give you an idea of the amount of testing that we’re going to be — going to be doing.
So I’m very exciting right now, as we complete this ecosystem with the large reference labs — the LabCorp and Quest providing the very high-throughput, large-scale testing; the galvanizing of the hospitals and academic labs that Dr. Birx has done, by a machine to machine, understanding and promoting that with the governors; and, of course, using point-of-care testing when and where that’s very important to stop outbreaks or in remote areas, like in the Indian Health Service or in Alaska.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  Thanks, Brett.
Okay.  So with that, we’re here to answer some questions, and Mike is up here also.  So, we’ll answer.
Steve, please go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-33/

April 24, 2020
5:39 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Thank you.  We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level.  Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly.
Last week, roughly 38 percent of the tests in New York were positive.  This week, that number is down to 28 percent.  New cases in New York are down 50 percent compared to a week ago.  And fatalities are down 40 percent over the same period.  In Louisiana, the rate of positive test result had declined from 25 percent down to 15 percent in the last seven days alone.
Eighteen states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days.  So, over the last seven days, there’s been very, very significant progress.
Half of all Americans live in states that have now taken steps to open their economies.  Just yesterday, Governors Gavin Newsom, California; Tim Walz of Minnesota; and Bill Lee of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors.
We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings.  We’re opening our country.  It’s very exciting to see.  We have a lot of talent involved, from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors.  There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country.  The country is a great place, and it’s going to be greater than ever before.  I really believe that.  I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift.
I spoke with Tim Cook, today, of Apple.  And they have a good sense of the market, and he feels it’s going to be a “V.”  The “V” is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.
Today, I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll.  Thirty billion dollars of the Paycheck Protection funds will be reserved for small financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American small-business owners and their employees.
The bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals — so badly needed for hospitals; they’ve taken a very big hit — and medical providers.  In areas less affected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care.
Under the CARES Act, we’re sending back payments to millions of American workers.  More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment: $3,400 for a typical family of four.  Three thousand four hundred dollars.  That’s great.  And you deserve it.
The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving.  To fulfill the requirement, the Treasury Department is mailing a letter to me.  It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrived — direct deposit, check, or prepaid debit card — as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family.  And that’s what’s been happening.
The whole world is watching us.  You have 184 countries out there that have been hit, and now it’s probably higher than that.  But they’re all watching us.  They’re all watching and they’re calling, and they respect what we’re doing, so much.
I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today.  They’re asking if we can send them ventilators, and I’m agreeing to do it.  We have tremendous capacity — now, over-capacity of ventilators.  We’re filling up stockpiles for our states and for ourselves.  The federal government has over 10,000 ventilators, and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that.  But we’re helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France.  We’re sending to France.  We’re sending to Spain.  We’re sending to Italy.  And we’ll probably be sending to Germany, should they need them.
Over the last three years, we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen.  Greatest economy the world has ever seen.  Nobody has ever done anything like what we were able to do.
And we will rebuild that economy.  Our economy in the not-too-distant future, I really believe, with all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve done, will be just as strong and maybe stronger than ever before — even stronger than it was just two months ago.
Some interesting note is that the FDA approved the first at-home COVID-19 test kit.  It just got approved.  And Dr. Stephen — where is Stephen?  Stephen Hahn.  Stephen?  — is going to say a couple of words about that and some other things.
I want to thank Stephen.  The FDA has been incredible. They’ve been approving not only this, but they’ve been approving many things at a pace that’s never happened before.  And they’re being very safe about it, as Stephen told me.  He’s told me — told me very strongly.  But at the same time, they’re approving things at record numbers, in a record — at a record rate.  And it’s really been helpful.
Many tests are going on — many vaccine tests and tests of every different kind.  And things are happening.  Just like this event, things are happening very rapidly.  And I’d like to have Stephen tell you a little bit about it.
Thank you very much.  Stephen, please.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I appreciate the opportunity to tell you about what’s happening at the FDA.  We have a team of more than 18,000 employees, including 10,000 scientists, doctors, pharmacists, and nurses, and they’ve been working around the clock because, as you probably know, many of the medical products that are being used for the COVID-19 outbreak are, in fact, regulated by FDA.  The staff have been hard at work authorizing tests and other medical products.
As part of these efforts to support diagnostic test development during this global pandemic, the President has asked us, and under his leadership, to actually cut down as many barriers as we possibly could to get medical products into the medical community, and we have done that, of course recognizing the urgency of the situation.
I do want to emphasize what the President said, that — is that we are very much paying attention to safety and with respect to test validity and reliability of those tests.
And I think it’s really important to understand how far we’ve come in just a few short months.  The academic community, which I come from; the private sector; the government — we’ve come together to develop diagnostics for a completely new infectious disease.
And it’s really important — we’ve heard from many test developers, both in academia and in the manufacturing world: This normally takes years to develop.  You’ve heard Dr. Birx talk about the fact that HIV tests has taken many, many years to develop.  This has happened in weeks and months.  We’ve been laser focused on working with both industry and academia to actually make this happen.
To date, under our emergency use authorization approach, we’ve quickly reviewed and authorized 63 tests, both diagnostic, as well as serologic — that is the antibody test.  We’ve had several point-of-care tests, and that’s important because those can be done in the emergency room or in a doctor’s office, et cetera, and much more convenient for the patient.
And this week, as the President said, we authorized the first at-home test by a company called LabCorp.  This is a test where, under certain circumstances, with a doctor’s supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient and the patient can perform the self-swab and then mail it back and get the results after that time — all under the guidance of a licensed physician.
And we’re not just letting up with these 63 tests we’ve approved.  We are working with more than 400 test developers who are pursuing authorization for their diagnostics under our current policies.  And under our regulatory approach, which is quite flexible, many other tests are becoming available.
We are — we have heard, and have reported to us, 220 labs around the country have begun patient testing using their own validated tests.  This has allowed us to increase, significantly, tests around the country.
I updated you earlier this week on serologic tests — these antibody tests that are used to detect natural immunity — and the FDA’s approach to help make these tests available.  While these are just one part of our larger response effort, they can play a role in helping move our economy forward by helping healthcare professionals identify those who have immunity to the COVID-19.
And just finally, when it comes to therapeutics, we are leaving no stone unturned in finding treatments for COVID-19.  You do know that we don’t have any approved currently therapeutics for COVID-19, but we are actively involved with both the academic and the commercial and private sector to find those.  Seventy-two trials of therapeutics are underway in the United States under FDA oversight and 211 are in the planning stages, so we expect to see more.  This includes convalescent plasma, as well as antiviral therapies.
Work continues on vaccines.  And two firms have announced that the FDA has authorized their trials to go forward, one of which we’ve mentioned here before.
And finally, in response to the President’s and Task Force’s request, we’ve stood up the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.  We are leaving no stone unturned, as I said, and we’re working around the clock to develop these therapeutics for the American people.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-32/

5:48 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.  I’m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses.
At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.  You see states are starting to open up now, and it’s very exciting to see.  I think it’s very awe-inspiring.  We’re coming out of it, and we’re coming out of it well.
And we’re — really, I’m very happy the governors have been — the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it’s — it’s, really, pretty impressive to see.  I’ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we’re leading the way.  We’re really leading the way in so many different ways.
I’m also very pleased that Harvard — as you know, it’s Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us.  And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at.  And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it’s about $350 million, and they’ve either not gone out or we’ve renegotiated it and they’re not getting them.
So — and it’s — in a couple of cases, they’re sending them back and sending them back immediately.  So I think it was very nice.  I want to thank Harvard in particular.  They acted very quickly and decisively.  And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it.  So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions.
The bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses.
As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we’re making great progress.  In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak — week.  Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases.  Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms.  That’s a big number.
To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance.  And we all understand that very well; we’ve gone over it many, many times.  This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering.
A safe and phased reopening of our economy — it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way.  On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back.  We’re winning this, and we’re going to win it, and we’re going to keep watching.  We’re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy.
With each passing day, we’re learning more and more about this enemy.  The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces.  The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments.
I have to say that, very excitingly, we’re going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while.  It was a great report you gave.  And he’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight.  Wait until you hear the numbers.  You won’t even believe them.
U.S. trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK, and China.  That’s big news.  And we’re — a lot of trials are going on.  We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this, both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics.
We must be careful in all conditions, but we will — we will get this done.  We’re very close to a vaccine.  Unfortunately, we’re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time.  But we’ll get it done.
And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he’s going to be doing and what he’s going to be saying and the report that he’s about to give.  I think it’s going to be something that nobody has ever heard.  It’ll be brand-new information and very important information.
My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies.  We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days.  And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process.  Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask.  So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks.  And it’s working very well.
We just want the hospitals and the institutions, where it is, to use it.  A lot of people don’t use it.  They’re so used to getting a new mask, they don’t want to use it.  They want to go and immediately get a new one.  We’re asking them to use the sterilization process.  Every bit as good — up to 20 times.  Think of that.
In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch.  It’s really a military operation.
The Vice President is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by-county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection.  And this is equipment and things that are incredible.  It’s personal protective equipment.  It’s incredible, and it’s all brand new and at the highest level.  We’re getting only the highest level.  And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak.
This way, the governor should know exactly what’s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge.  We’re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state.  When we can’t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors.  And we’re getting them fast, and we’re notifying them very strongly so they know it’s there.  Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed.
Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation’s incredible county emergency management teams who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end, to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies, and save countless American lives.  We salute these heroic officials on the frontlines.
As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus.  The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick — and frankly, those that are very sick.  Nearly 3,000 patients are now enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, receiving transfusions nationwide.
And I want to thank all of the people that recovered, for what they’ve done.  They — as I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they’re saying, “I want to donate blood.  I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.”  It’s really quite incredible.
Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type.  This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high-risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place.  A very big deal.
Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks, and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution.  I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you’re doing, because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help.  And they’ve been so great, and I just appreciate it.
My administration has also partnered with leading — and we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence.
Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies.  And we’re collaborating with tech firms, universities, and our national labs to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines.  That search is going on, and it’s being — I think you’ll see in the future — you’ll see it’s very successful.  Ultimately, it’ll be a tremendous success.  Great progress is being made at a rapid pace — a pace like no other.
We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology, and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague, and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity.
Our country is going to do fantastically well.  You see what’s going on.  There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better, and that’s what’s going to happen.
So with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up — Vice President.  Say a few words please, Mike.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon.  Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met.  And while our hearts are with the families of those who have lost their life to the coronavirus and those who are struggling with serious illness today, our team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, informs us that the data continues to show promising signs of progress.
The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be past their peak.  And we are seeing consistent declines in hospitalization and cases in regions across the country.
Our only conclusion is that we’re getting there, America, because the American people have put into practice the President’s guidelines of social distancing because you’ve been listening and adhering to the guidance of state and local officials.  We are — we’re making — we’re making meaningful progress.  In a very real sense, sparing Americans to be exposed to the coronavirus and, no less extent, saving lives.
Our task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead — as states implement their policies, including phased reopening — that we’ll preserve those gains.  We do believe, by early summer, we could be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us.
Earlier today, we also had a conference call led by Secretary Ben Carson and leaders from HUD about the President’s announcement yesterday that he is repurposing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority communities.  Secretary Carson will convene the council tomorrow, and we’ll be reporting tomorrow afternoon on their progress.
We want to thank the more than 270 leaders of organizations dedicated to housing, homelessness, and improving the lives of people across our urban communities — not only for being with us today, for the way they have partnered with our administration and partnered with state and local officials to put the health of all of their constituencies first.
As the President mentioned, we’ll — you’ll receive a report that our task force received formally this week from Bill Bryan of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security.  He will outline, as the President said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer.
On the subject of testing: At the present moment, we have reports of 4.93 million tests having been performed across America.  And encouraging news: As states have been engaging commercial labs at a higher level across the country, yesterday our commercial lab system did more than 100,000 tests in a single day.  So we’re beginning to activate all of the capacity.
And tomorrow, at the President’s direction, our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation’s governors to talk about the progress that they are making on testing.  And we’re going to hear from governors about the practices that — and methods that they are employing to significantly increase testing following our briefing about capacity in laboratories this past Monday.
For instance, Governor Mike DeWine just announced that Ohio’s testing has been greatly expanded after the FDA approved Thermo Fisher’s new extraction reagent, saying, in his words, that the action, quote, “probably doubled, maybe even tripled testing in Ohio virtually overnight.”
Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota announced, along with the state’s healthcare system, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota, what he described as a breakthrough for rapid, widespread testing — able to test more than 20,000 people using a molecular test per day.
Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa launched the Test Iowa Initiative that will triple testing capacity by partnering with Nomi Health and DOMO.  She also worked with the University of Iowa Hospitals to leverage further capacity.
And Governor Eric Holcomb and Governor Andy Beshear, of Indiana and Kentucky respectively, both announced additional drive-through testing locations.
Our priority has always been to focus first on those impacted by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare workers ministering to their needs every day.  And I know, Mr. President, how proud you are that our men and women in uniform have come alongside our healthcare workers in communities most impacted, and I know the American people are proud as well.
As of today, FEMA reports that 35,000 National Guard have been deployed across the country to aid in our coronavirus response.  Governor Kevin Stitt of Ohio [Oklahoma] actually deployed the National Guard to hospitals across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it in to state emergency management and FEMA.
And Governor Greg Abbott of Texas actually mobilized more than 1,200 National Guard and 45 teams to provide greater access to testing.
Along with the National Guard, at the President’s direction today, more than 4,500 active duty military doctors, nurses, and medical assistants have been deployed across the country.  Yesterday, 1,013 medical professionals in our military were actually deployed to 19 hospitals in 7 states to support those amazing healthcare workers.
And with 4.4 million more Americans filing for unemployment in the past week, I joined the President in welcoming passage in the House today of the Paycheck Protection Program.  It’ll support working families.  It’ll allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for a period of two months.  But it also, as the President requested, included $75 billion to assist hospitals across the country.
And in that spirit, the President and I will continue to urge states across the country: Given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries, wherever possible — either statewide or on a county-by-county basis.  We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals and we’ll be working with states to enable that.
In that vein, Governor Doug Ducey exec- — issued an executive order not long ago, allowing elective surgeries beginning May 1 for hospitals that meet certain preparedness criteria.
And Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, is allowing elective clinical procedures to begin on April 21st.
Finally, Mr. President, the task force received today our first report on state reopening plans.  At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans.  Thirteen of those were actually released since you unveiled the Opening Up America Guidelines to our governors and to the nation last week.
And to your point, Mr. President, states are beginning to make those plans.  And we’re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that’s contemplated in our Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.
For instance, Governor Mike Parson of Missouri announced the “Show Me Strong” Recovery Plan as two initial phases intended to protect the most at-risk.
Governor Tom Wolf announced the Plan for Pennsylvania that would begin May 8th — will end a stay-at-home order for just portions of Pennsylvania.  But the plan, again, requires regions to have fewer than 50 new positive cases per 100,000 for a period of 14 days, and it also lays out a phased reopening roadmap.
Governor Kate Brown of Oregon updated their framework for reopening, doing three phases — again, on a county-by-county basis.
And Governor Brad Little of Idaho released “Rebound Idaho” in just the last few days that will consist of four phases and require specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen.
Mr.  President, with the — with the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, states are making plans.  And at your direction, our task force will continue to work very closely, providing them with the data, providing them with the resources to be able to implement those plans in a safe and responsible way.
So, with that, let me just end where I began, and to say thank you to the American people.  The progress that we are seeing is a testament to what all of you have done; to our extraordinary healthcare workers; to a partnership between the federal government and to state and local official.  And I’m confident it’s also owing to the prayers of millions of Americans each and every day.
All of that combined, we’re — we’re slowing the spread.  We’re protecting the most vulnerable.  We’re saving lives.  And every single day, we are one day closer to opening up America again.
With that, Mr. President, I’d be pleased to call Bill forward.  Bill Bryan leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security and now will make a presentation on their recent study.
ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:  Thank you, Mr.  Vice President.  Thank you, Mr.  President —
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bill.
ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: — for this opportunity to do this today.
Good afternoon everybody.  My name is Bill Bryan and I lead the Science and Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Over the last several months, we’ve intensified the Department’s R&D efforts to identify and deliver information that informs our response to COVID-19.  S&T is working to identify, develop, deploy, and deploy the tools and information to support our response to this crisis.
As part of our efforts, we’re leveraging the unique capabilities of S&T’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center to study the biology of the COVID-19 virus.  This center is a high-biocontainment laboratory located in Frederick, Maryland.  It was established in the early 2000s, in response to the Amerithrax attacks, and where we study, characterize, analyze, and develop countermeasures for biological threats to the homeland.  We work closely with the CDC, FDA, HHS, and also our Department of Defense colleagues and many others.
Yesterday, I shared the emerging results of our work that we’re doing now with the Coronavirus Task Force.  And today, I would like to share certain trends that we believe are important.
If I may have the first slide, please.  And while that’s coming up, our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus — both surfaces and in the air.  We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus.
So let me illustrate with this first slide.  If you look to the right, you’ll see that term “half-life,” with a bunch of timestamps on there.
First, let me tell you what a “half-life” is.  We don’t measure the virus as far as how long we live on the surface; we have to measure the decay of the virus in terms of its half-life, because we don’t know certain elements.  We don’t know how much a person expectorates when he — when he spits — right? — when he sneezes, whatever the case may be.  We don’t know how much virus is in there.  So it’s — that has a long — a bearing on how long the virus is going to be alive and active.  So we measure it in half life because half-life doesn’t change.
So if you look at an 18-hour half-life, what you’re basically saying is that every 18 hours, the virus — it’s the life of the virus is cut in half.  So if you start with 1,000 particles of the virus, in 18 hours, you’re down to 500.  And 18 hours after that, you’re down to 250, and so on and so forth.  That’s important, as I explain in the rest of the chart.
If you look at the first three lines, when you see the word “surface,” we’re talking about nonporous surfaces: door handles, stainless steel.  And if you look at the — as the temperature increases, as the humidity increases, with no sun involved, you can see how drastically the half-life goes down on that virus.  So the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace, just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity.
If you look at the fourth line, you inject summer — the sunlight into that.  You inject UV rays into that.  The same effects on line two — as 70 to 35 degrees with 80 percent humidity on the surface.  And look at line four, but now you inject the sun.  The half-life goes from six hours to two minutes.  That’s how much of an impact UV rays has on the virus.
The last two lines are aerosols.  What does it do in the air?  We have a very unique capability — I was discussing this with the President prior to coming out; he wanted me to convey it to you — on how we do this.  I believe we’re the only lab in the country that has this capability.
But if you can imagine a Home Depot bucket — a five-gallon Home Depot bucket — we’re able to take a particle — and this was developed and designed by our folks at the NBACC.  We’re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperatures, various humidity levels, multiple different kinds of environmental conditions, to include sunlight.  And we’re able to measure the decay of that virus while it’s suspended in the air.  This is how we do our aerosol testing.
We worked with John Hopkin Applied Physics Lab, and we actually developed a larger drum to do actually more testing.  And it’s four times the size of that.  So this is the capability that we bring to this effort.
So, in summary, within the conditions we’ve tested to date, the virus in droplets of saliva survives best in indoors and dry conditions.  The virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva.  And that’s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done, number one, with the COVID-19 virus, and number two, in saliva or respiratory fluids.
And thirdly, the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.  And when you — when you look at that chart, look at the aerosol as you breathe it; you put it in a room, 70 to 75 degrees, 20 percent humidity, low humidity, it lasts — the half-life is about an hour.  But you get outside, and it cuts down to a minute and a half.  A very significant difference when it gets hit with UV rays.
And, Mr. President, while there are many unknown links in the COVID-19 transmission chain, we believe these trends can support practical decision making to lower the risks associated with the virus.
If I can have my next slide.
And when that — while that comes up, you’ll see a number of some practical applications.  For example, increasing the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminated indoor spaces appears to reduce the stability of the virus.  And extra care may be warranted for dry environments that do not have exposure to solar light.
We’re also testing disinfectants readily available.  We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.  And I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that’s with no manipulation, no rubbing — just spraying it on and letting it go.  You rub it and it goes away even faster.  We’re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva.
This is not the end of our work as we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our findings into practical applications to mitigate exposure and transmission.  I would like to thank the President and thank the Vice President for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in addressing this pandemic.  I would also like to thank the scientists, not only in S&T and the NBACC, but to the larger scientific and R&D community.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bill.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-31/

6:10 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  A lot of tremendous things are happening.  The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide.  Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing.  The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what’s going on.  And they’re going down; they’re going in the right direction.  Cases in the Boston area are now declining.  The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific.  And Detroit is past its peak.
These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen.  It’s very exciting.  It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what’s happening.  And people are getting ready and they’re all excited.
I do want to mention a man who’s done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield.  He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus.  Totally misquoted.  I spoke to him.  He said it was ridiculous.  He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time.  And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we’ll take care of.  We’re going to knock it out.  We’ll knock it out fast.  But that’s what he was referring to: coming together at the same time.
And I think rather than waiting, I’d ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn’t say it was a big — a big explosion.  The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate.  The statement wasn’t bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is — as I say, that’s fake news.  And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew.  They were asked to change it, and they wouldn’t do that.  And it was false.
So I’ll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain.  Please.  Thank you, Doctor.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I really do think it’s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people.
When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of the fall, winter — next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time: influenza and the coronavirus-19.
But I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say.  I didn’t say that this was going to be worse.  I said it was going to be more complic- — or more difficult and potentially complicated because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.
I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation’s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to sustain the containment mode.  Those of you who heard me talk before, I’ve told you that in January and February — up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases.  We were in the containment mode.  And then, unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into this extreme mitigation.
We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter season so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring.
I have confidence that our public health response of early case recognition that we’ve talked about, isolation, and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective public health strategy so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode.
Again, that will be supported by the American public’s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate.
The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence.  One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.
Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-30/

5:46 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much everyone.  We had a very big day today.  I want to start by saying that our love and prayers of every American continue to be with our fellow citizens who have lost a cherished friend or a family member to the virus.
Amidst our grief, we’re making tremendous strides against this invisible enemy.  Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals, our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world.  And that’s due to a lot of — a lot of things, but our medical professionals have been incredible.
Since we announced our “Guidelines on Opening Up America,” as we call it — we say “Opening up America,” and we add the word agun [sic].  I think we can add the word, probably, “again.”  But that’s what it is: We’re opening up America again.
Twenty states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future.  So that’s 20 states; that’s about 40 percent of our country.  They’re moving along pretty quickly.  Three announced today, as you know, and they’re going to be doing it safely.  They’re going to be doing it with tremendous passion.  There’s — they want to get back to work.  The country wants to get back to work.
A short time ago, the Senate passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act, with additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, hospitals, and testing.  A lot of money for all of them, especially for our workers and our small businesses.
My administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical 482-billion-dollar funding package.  We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small-business support to keep workers on the payroll; $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid, and very badly — I’m very proud of that; and $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts.
I urge the House to pass the bill, and they’re going to be voting on it, I imagine, very — very soon.
I think while we’re here, and so he’s a very busy man, as you know — Secretary Mnuchin — he’s going to be running back, so I thought we’d do — we’ll talk about that now, and we’ll take a couple of questions on that.  And then he can go and start phase four, as the ink is drying.
Probably, they’ll be voting tomorrow in the House, but shortly.  Shortly.  And I think we have tremendous support.
So, Steve, please come up.  Say a few words.  Steve?  Yeah.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you for all your work with us to get this passed.  I’d especially like to thank Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and the entire Senate for passing this.  I’d also like to thank Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, who have been working with us around the clock as well, and our Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, who was also very instrumental in this.
Let me just comment.  We’ve had tremendous support for the PPP.  This gives us another $310 billion for the PPP.  We look forward to the House passing this tomorrow and being up and running quickly after that.
This also gives us $50 billion for disaster loans, EIDL loans.  That will allow the SBA to make $300 billion of disaster loans, all for small businesses.  It also allows us, as the President said, more money to hospitals and an unprecedented amount of money for testing.  And again, I think we understand hospitals — not only the hospitals that have been impacted by coronavirus, but more importantly, many hospitals that have been shut down, and making sure that the doctors and nurses get money.
Now, let me make just one more comment on the program.  We have over a million companies that have received this with less than 10 workers.  So there is very broad participation in really small business.  I will comment there have been some big businesses that have taken these loans.  I was pleased to see that Shake Shack returned the money.  We will be putting out some FAQs.  There is a certification that people are making.
And I asked people — just make sure: The intent of this was for business that needed the money.  We’ll put out an FAQ.  But again, the intent of this money was not for big public companies that have access to capital.
THE PRESIDENT:  And not for Harvard, you might say, Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-3/

5:39 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everyone.  Thank you.  Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence; we’re going to have a resurgence, too.  At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion.
During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody has become very familiar with.
We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.  For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially.  You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30 percent, 25 percent.  In Detroit, as an example, it’s down by over 50 percent.  Congratulations.  And, in New Orleans, where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65 percent.
Thirty states have just one case or less per 1,000 people — far fewer cases per capita, as an example, than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.
My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs.  We hope to have an agreement very soon.  And hopefully tomorrow, the Senate is going to be able to vote.  A lot of progress has been made on that — tremendous progress.  It’s a great plan.  It’s a great plan.  It’s helped a lot of people.  So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate.
And based on the record-low price of oil that you’ve been seeing — it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people — we’re filling up our National Petroleum Reserves.  Strategic — you know, the Strategic Reserves.  And we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves.  That would top it out.  That would be first time in a long time it’s been topped out.  We’d get it for the right price.
We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional $75 billion — our deal; the deal we’re talking about — $75 billion for hospitals and other healthcare providers.  Many providers and their employees have taken a huge financial hit in recent weeks.  And visits, elective procedures, surgeries, et cetera, et cetera, were canceled.  We think that they can all get back online.  They’ll get it done.  The hospitals have really been fantastic.  The hospitals, they’ve — they’ve stepped up to the plate.  They’ve really done a great job.  We appreciate it so much.
For areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments.  HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country.  We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African American and Hispanic American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need.
Earlier today, Vice President Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus.  He had a great call.  It was a great call — very positive in, I’d say, every way.  Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states — many, many labs.  We’re providing you with the list.  We’ll show it to you now if you need it.  We’ll give you the details.  But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able.
Some of the governors, like, as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list.  He didn’t understand too much about what was going on.  So now I think he’ll be able to do that.  It’s pretty simple.  But they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out.  We’ll work with him and work with all of the governors.
Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity.  Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand.  And it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it.  The governor, as an example, Pritzker from Illinois did not understand his capacity.  Not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support — I mean, you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing.  And they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up.  And you’ll be seeing that; we’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it.
I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomo’s remarks during his press conference today.  He said: The President is right.  The states’ testing is up to the states to do, which will implement the test and logistically coordinate the tests.  We have about 300 labs in New York and they do it.  And they’re great labs, actually.  And it’s my job to coordinate those 300 labs.  I think the President is right when he says that the states should lead.
And the governor is really — they’re really getting — they’re getting it together in New York.  A lot of good things are happening in New York.  And I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow.  He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon.  Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people.  So we look forward to that.
The — some of the articles that just recently came about — if you remember, I put out a statement today.  For a month, it was all “ventilator, ventilator, ventilator.”  That’s all people could talk about was ventilators.  And we did a great job with that.  We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly.  We have so many now that, at some point soon, we’re going to be helping Mexico and Italy and other countries.  We’ll be sending them ventilators, which they desperately need.  They were a position — they were not in a position to build them themselves.
But we have thousands being built.  Every state has had — they have the ventilators.  If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our Federal Reserve — our “stockpile,” as they call it.  And we did a great job with the ventilators.
Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it — other than the fair press.  But — so then you say, “Gee, I — they need ventilators.”  We don’t need ventilators.  And that’s — that’s under pressure we did that.
Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one.  And a story that just came out: “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story.”  I’m sure you love to see that.  That’s by Rich Lowry, a respected journalist and person.  “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story” — which, unfortunately, you did.
And here’s another one that just came out.  Kyle Smith.  “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t.”  “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t” — because we got it fixed.  And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators.  So if a thing like this should happen again, they’ve got them.
The stories on testing are all over the place — that we’re actually in good shape.  I’m going to have the Vice President and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time.  You’re going to see some interesting things.
I thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who has done an incredible job, tell you where we are.  You know we’re still building beds and hospitals for people that need them.  I guess the hospital business generally is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re — we’re creating a lot of space for people, just in case.  And in some cases, they probably will be using them.
But I thought the general — he’s been so impressive and done such a great job.  I thought, on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government, he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now.
Thank you very much.  General.
LIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:  Well, thank you, Mr.  President.  I just want you to know that, on behalf of all of us in the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those patients and all those victims that have been affected by this terrible virus.
And the President of Vice President talk all the time about the heroes, but when I’ve been out there, I’ve seen the doctors, I’ve seen the nurses, and all those that have worked very, very hard, and we’re just — we’re just so proud to be part of this noble calling.
I — for my team, I really made it very, very simple.  I said there’s three legs of this stool, and they all have “S’s”: There are “sites” — in other words, hospitals; we’ve got to worry about “supplies”; and we’ve got to worry about “staff.”
And so, right when Governor Cuomo called the President, about almost 30 days ago, he said, “I need some help” — worrying about what could be tens of thousands of hotel room — I mean, of hospital room shortages.
So the President and Secretary of Defense asked us to fly to Albany with a team.  And on the way up, we understood how complex of a challenge this was, and we knew there was no way you can solve a complex catastrophe with a complicated solution.  We needed a very, very simple solution to be able to then work with HHS, to be able to work with FEMA, to be able to work with the Vice President’s task force, and then to be able to power this down all the way down to the local level.
Some of the governors asked us to try to build a hospital in a parking lot or a field in two or three weeks.  You can’t physically do that.  So what we said was, “Let’s go to where there’s an existing facility.”  And I’m going to kind of make this in two big pots: those that are either hotel rooms or college dormitories, smaller rooms — or those that are in real large areas, like field houses or convention centers.
And we designed those standard facilities that could be either non-COVID or COVID, and then we got that approved here at the federal government to be able to then power that back down.
So we went to Governor Cuomo, and he said, right up front, “I love the concept.  I need you in the Javits Center.  I’m ready to start having you work tomorrow afternoon.”
So when we flew back that afternoon, the next day, we basically built this standard design and then continued to be able to power it down, all the way down through the rest of the team.
So I just want to show you a couple of slides here.  And we’ll — we’ll kind of let you know where we’re at right now, Mr President.
We had to do a bunch of assessments, so somewhere in the order of over 1,100 different locations we went to.  And we work for FEMA, and we work for the President, and we work for governors and mayors.  And we said, “What do you think your demand is going to be?”  And based on a lot of the modeling that’s been in this room here, we were able to understand when the peak curve was, but we also were able to understand where’s the bed shortage.
So then, these 1,100 facilities — right now today, sir, we’re actually executing 32 different facilities.  That’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds.  Eight of those are all done.  We’ve still got a lot more to complete.  And in the next week and a half, we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities.
We’ve got some pending.  Some mayors and governors are still wondering do they have enough bed space.  And what’s important here is we need a very agile plan.  You can’t do something three weeks ago and think that this is going to continue to stay, because this virus gets a vote.  And this entire team — the federal government has tried to be as agile as they can, supporting those states and those governors.
The beauty of the plan, though, was it doesn’t have to be built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  So we designed about an extra 52 facilities.  We gave those to the governors.  And I’ve got to be very, very laudatory to the governors.  They then imposed and put a lot of those on the — on the ground and did those themselves.
So let’s go to — I’m just going to show you some real simple pictures here.  Go to the next slide, if you don’t mind.
So this is an example of the Javits Center, and you heard the President talk about it quite a few times.  This one, about 2,100 bed spaces.  What you get is about an 11- or 12-foot-square cubicle.  There is lights in there.  There’s a nurse call, so if you need to be able to call the nurse station.  There are nurse spaces throughout.  There’s pharmacies throughout.  This one started as non-COVID, but then we came back in and put in central oxygen.  So everybody has oxygen right behind their bed to be able to take care of those patients.  And again built this one, and about 1,000 patients treated.
Let’s go to the next one.
I was up in Detroit with Governor Whitmer, and she walked us through and told us her intent.  Here’s what — she needed to do this in the TCF Center.  You’ll see all the cubicles that are laid out.  This is right in the middle of a convention floor where there might be like a boat show or a car show, and then we went in and we built 970 different capabilities there.
And again, a lot of great work by my guys in the Corps of Engineers and the rest of the mayors in the cities’ team all pulling together.
Let’s go to the next one.
This is called the McCormick Place.  Governor Pritzker sat us down.  He said, “Here’s, kind of, our intent on what you want to do.”  Mayor Lightfoot walked us through, and we went into another large convention center.  This is actually 3,000 bed spaces.  This was a very, very large build.  And got this one done in a relatively short time.
And then here’s another one that kind of helps you understand the dynamic here.  Go to the next one, please.
This is in Miami Beach, and I flew in to see Governor DeSantis.  And my guys had kind of scoped out about 450 beds, and he said, “Todd, how long is it going to take to build this?”  And we kind of said, “Probably until the 27th of April.”  And he went to his health people and he said, “How long do you need?”  And he said, “The day we need this is the 21st of April.”  And I told my guys, “You don’t have until the 27th.  Figure out how to get it done by the 20th.”
This is where you don’t get to build to be able to have the perfect solution.  You got to be able to get the mission essential done.  Lives are on the line here, and we’ve got to be able to get everything done to be able to save those lives.
And let’s go to the last one here.  This is one we’re doing right now: Colorado.  This is in Denver, in another gigantic convention center.  You’ll see all the different cubicles here to be able to just bring in that oxygen.  Six-inch copper pipe that comes in, and it’s all piped throughout the entire convention center.  Six miles of pipe that’s able to go in to be able to make that happen.
And in closing, I just want to be able to say that we are very, very focused in the Corps of Engineers on getting this done, but this is all about the team — the federal team, the state team, the local team.  The Vice President and his task force, and on a lot of the people sitting here, have informed us of how fast we need to go.  And it goes back to, again, all the governors and the mayors to make this happen.
But I want to reiterate: President Trump has called me three times, and Secretary Esper has been on the phone at least one of those times, and said, “What else do we need to do to set you up for success?  Is there any other knobs we can turn to be able to help you go?”  And you think about that equation of those three “S’s.”  I think that with the federal government and the mayors in the cities here, we’ve effectively taken that first “S” out of the equation.
And, sir, I can’t tell you, of all the things I’ve done in my career, this is a noble calling to be able to step up and save American lives.
So, with that, sir, I thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.  Thank you very much.  Anybody have a question for the general while he’s here?  Anybody?  Because I think he’s very self-explanatory.  He’s done an incredible job.
Jeff, do you have a question?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-29/

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I’d like to begin by saying that we’re continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of.  I think we — we’re getting close to a deal.  It could happen.  It could happen.  A lot of good work has been going on, and we could have an answer tomorrow.  And we’re going to see what — what exactly does take place.
We’re also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals, who have been hurt very badly.  The rural hospitals, for a long time, have not been treated properly.  We’re looking to help them, and beyond.  So we’re looking at hospitals also, as part of the package.  And we’ll see how that all comes out.
But a lot of good things are happening.  Some very good negotiations.  I just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury, and we have some very good negotiations going on right now.  And I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow, but we’ll see.
America continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus.  As of today, we’ve tested 4.18 million Americans.  That’s a record anywhere in the world.  The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada.
And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people.  So we’ve — we’ve done more testing than all of these countries combined: France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, and Australia, Sweden, and Canada.  That’s something.  Right?
We’re doing a great job.  We’re — we are.  This team is an incredible team, and that includes Army Corps of Engineers, a lot of our military people, our admirals, our generals.  Got one of our great admirals here, who’s done an incredible job.  You haven’t slept too much in the last two months either.  Look at him.  (Laughs.)
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  No, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s — somebody said to me, “President, you look tired.”  I said, “I should be tired.”  We should all be tired.  But we have to win, right?
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Tomorrow, the President — the Vice President will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters, Mike —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  — to review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies.  Working very hard with governors now on testing.  We want to help them out.
Before the call, we’ll send them a full list of all of the large laboratory machines in the states.  They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there, and they’re really high-quality machines, by the way.  And the potential capacity of those machines, if they’re fully utilized — a couple of them didn’t know that they could be utilized in a different manner.  They’re only up to 10 percent, and they can go 90 percent more.
Many governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them.  As an example, commercial laboratories, such as Quest and LabCorp — these are massive laboratories that can handle a lot more than they’re being sent.  A few days ago, it was at 30 percent.  They’re only at 30 percent capacity now.  I don’t know — probably the same, but they have a lot of capacity.
In addition, academic laboratories, big research labs — there’s tremendous capacity out there.  And some of them want the fast — you know, the instant Abbott machine, which just came about due to the research during this little short period of time.  And it’s very quick, but these labs can do them very quickly also, and they’re — they’re massive.  They can handle much more — much more than the machine, the small machine, can handle.
We continue to procure millions of swabs, test collectors.  I have something here.  Just happen to have it.  It’s a swab.  It looks innocent.  Not very complicated.  Anybody like to see what it looks like?  Should I open it?  Does everybody?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-28/

5:09 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Good afternoon.  We continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak.  It’s been very devastating all over the world.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.  Probably more.  That number was as of a week ago.
Dr. Birx will walk through some of these trends in a few moments, but they’re very positive trends for winning.  Going to win.  We’re going to close it out.
While we mourn the tragic loss of life — and you can’t mourn it any stronger than we’re mourning it — the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country, with the possible exception of Germany.  And I think we’re as good or better.
On a per capita basis — remember that: On a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of Western Europe, with the lone exception of possibly Germany.  This includes the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France.  Spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the United States, but you don’t hear that.  You hear we have more death.  But we’re much bigger countries than any of those countries by far.
So when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the United States is number one — but we’re not number one; China is number one, just so you understand.  China is number one by a lot.  It’s not even close.  They’re way ahead of us in terms of death.  It’s not even close.  You know it.  I know it.  And they know it.  But you don’t want to report it.  Why?  You’ll have to explain that.  Someday I’ll explain it.
Since we released the guidelines to open up America again — and this was two days ago — a number of states, led by both Democrat and Republican governors, have announced concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual, and phased opening.
Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions.  And I can tell you the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he knows what he’s doing.  He’s a great governor.  He knows exactly what he’s doing.
Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.  Ohio, North Dakota, and Idaho have advised non-essential businesses to prepare for a phased opening starting May 1st.
Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken unprecedented actions to rush economic relief to our citizens.  As an example, you don’t hear anymore about ventilators.  What happened to the ventilators?  And now they’re giving you the other; it’s called “testing.”  Testing.  But they don’t want to use all of the capacity that we’ve created.  We have tremendous capacity.  Dr. Birx will be explaining that.  They know that.  The governors know that.  The Democrat governors know that; they’re the ones that are complaining.
Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve already processed nearly $350 billion to 1.6 million small businesses across the nation to keep American workers on the payroll.  So we’re asking the Democrats to get it done.  This should be bipartisan.  This should be 100 percent vote.  And it’s really been incredible.  The $350 billion that’s been approved is so popular, and it’s keeping businesses open.  It’ll be open hopefully forever.
Our swift action is directly supporting 30 million American jobs.  Amy Wright, from North Carolina, as an example, said the program is a “game changer” for her and her family.  It’s coffee shops.  And she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities.  And now they’re all staying, and they’re getting paid.  And she’s got a dream, and it’s going to take place very quickly when she opens again.  So, Amy, good luck.  North Carolina — great place.
Scott and Julie Alderink helped lead a church and own a restaurant in South Dakota, with about 15 employees.  They were already starting layoffs.  Layoffs were moving along rapidly.  But now they’ve hired their employees back, and they can keep the restaurant open.  And it’ll be moving quickly — very quickly — as opposed to not having anybody and probably not having a place to have all of these people employed.  She would have been out of business.  She would have been done.
The Paycheck Protection Program funding is now fully drained.  It’s out.  It’s gone.  Three hundred and fifty billion dollars to small businesses.  And, in turn, it goes to the employees of those small businesses.
Lawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay.  The Democrats have to come onboard.  I used to read that these were Democrat programs, not Republican.  It seems to have switched around a lot, hasn’t it?  Huh?  Switched around a lot.  The republicans want it.  I think the Democrats probably do too.
But they also want other things that are unacceptable.  This is about COVID.  This is about the plague and what it’s done to us.  This isn’t about extraneous things that they’ve been trying to get for years and that our country doesn’t want them to have.
As we enter the next stage of our battle, we are continuing our relentless effort to destroy the virus.  My administration is taking steps to protect high-risk communities by providing funding for 13,000 community health center sites and mobile medical stations.
In order to equip them with the most advanced and robust testing capabilities, these sites are incredible.  What they can do is incredible.  The job they do is incredible.  These centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions, including many African American and Hispanic communities.  We’re taking care of them.  And it’s so important, because you’ve all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on African American, and you’re reading a little bit less about Hispanic, but likewise Hispanic communities.  The numbers are disproportionate.  In fact, we’re doing big studies on it right now.  We don’t like it.  Not right.
Nationwide, we’ve now conducted over 4 million tests, and Deborah will be talking about that.  It’s double the number conducted by any other country on Earth.  So that’s more than two times, actually, the number conducted by any other country on Earth.  You hear so much about testing.  What we’ve done is incredible on testing.  And I started with an obsolete, broken system from a previous administration — or administrations.  But I would really say “administration” for a different reason because testing has become so advanced over the last number of years, and we have the most advanced of all.
I spoke with other nations this morning — the leaders — and they all are talking about our great testing capability, and some of them want to know what to do; what — how can they get involved, because they need it for their own countries.
In Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and other hotspots, we have also tested more people per capita, by far, than Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, and all other major countries.  So think of that.  In New York, for instance, per capita testing is 6 percent higher than in Singapore.  In fact, there’s a typo.  It’s 67 percent higher.  That’s a big difference.
I’d say there’s a big difference between six percent and sixty- — I was looking; I said, 6 percent doesn’t look too good.  It’s 67 percent — good job out there — higher than Singapore; 64 higher than South Korea; and 47 percent higher than Australia.  So it’s 67 percent higher than Singapore, which is a very advanced place in terms of what they’re doing.
My administration has also been speaking frequently with many of the governors to help them find and unlock the vast unused testing capacity that exists in their states.  Dr. Birx discussed yesterday the commercial and academic laboratories, and the states have tremendous unused capability, which they can use.  The governors should use it.  Tremendous unused capability, and they’re waiting for business from these governors that — some of them complain.  I must tell you, for the most part, we’re getting along great with them, but some of them like to complain.
But I still go back because the hardest thing of all, by far, by a factor of 20, is the ventilators.  And now we’re the king of ventilators.  We have ventilators.
We’re going to be helping other countries very soon.  We’re going to be helping Mexico.  I spoke with the President of Mexico.  He’s great.  A great guy.  And I told him we’re going to be helping him.  They desperately, in Mexico, need ventilators, and I told him we’re going to be helping him very substantially.  We’re in a position to do that.  We’re building, now, thousands a week.  And they’re coming in rapidly, and they’re very, very high quality.
But we’re also helping governors to develop strategies to smartly deploy their testing capacity to protect vulnerable and underserved populations, while getting Americans at lower risk safely back to work.
So, again, we have tremendous testing capacity.  Now, a lot of people like the Abbott test that we came up with.  Abbott is a brand-new technology, brand-new test.  It’s great.  It’s five minutes, boom, you put it in.  And we’re making thousands of machines.  Abbott is making thousands and thousands of machines.  But not everybody is going to get that one, but they’re going to get others.  We have numerous platforms which we’ll talk about in a minute.
Unfortunately, some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing, which they shouldn’t be doing, because I inherited broken junk.  Just as they did with ventilators where we had virtually none, and the hospitals were empty.  For the most part, the hospitals didn’t have ventilators.  We had to take care of the whole country, and we did a job, the likes of which nobody — we assembled an army of young, brilliant people.  For the most part, young; a couple of older ones.  But for the most part, they were young, brilliant geniuses that did a job like nobody would believe.  I wish you could have seen it.  Around the clock.
And now the rest of the world is coming to us, asking if we could help them with ventilators because they’re very complicated, very expensive.  They’re very hard to build.  And we have them coming in by the thousands.  But you don’t hear that from even the governors.  Nobody is complaining about ventilators.  And if there was a surge, we could have ventilators to them within hours, because we have in stockpile almost 10,000 ventilators.
You don’t hear about hospital beds.  When I first started, everyone was talking, “Oh, hospitals beds.  Hospitals beds.”   The governor of New York correctly asked me for hospital beds, and we got the Army Corps of Engineers out, and they built them.  He needed them.  I mean, he — we went — I know he said that we were projecting.  We’re not projecting New York.  We’re listening to the governors.  He wanted them.  He needed them.  And we gave him thousands of beds in Javits Center.  We brought the ship.  And then the ship, we had it converted to COVID-19.  And that was a big deal, by the way, because of ventilation and all the things we had to do.  But we did.
And fortunately for him — and for us, all of us — they haven’t used either one very much because the numbers have gone down significantly.  But it was there, and it was built, and it was beautiful.  Two thousand nine hundred beds.  It was incredible what they did.  They did it in a matter of a few days.
But, unfortunately — and it was very good; the relationship was very good.  And I’m, frankly, glad they don’t need them, but they were there.  Louisiana, the same thing.  I think the governor — a Democrat, good guy — and he will, I think, tell you a story that we had more than enough, and I said, “Well, we’re supposed to build one more.”  I called him and I said, “You know, if we don’t have to build this hospital” — it was an additional anywhere from 500 to 1,000 beds.  “If you don’t need it, would it be possible that we don’t build it?  We’d like to build it someplace else, or not build it at all and save money,” which is okay for government to use it someplace else.  And he called call me back the next day and he said, “Sir, we don’t need it.”  I said, “That’s great that you say that.  I appreciate it.”  And he didn’t need it.
But we were ready to go, and we took good care of Louisiana.  We took good care of Michigan.  We took good care of every place.  We didn’t — we didn’t miss a trick.
And we’re in great shape on testing.  We have different platforms.  We actually have nine different platforms.  And on Monday, we’re going to be adding one; that’ll be 9 to 10.  I don’t like to count on them before they’re up, but we’ll have anywhere from 9 to 10 platforms with a tremendous testing capability.  And people can go, and especially with phase one.
Now, at the same time — just like with ventilators — we’re building now the best ventilators.  Just like with ventilators, our testing is getting better and better.  I took the first test.  The first test was not pleasant.  This was not a pleasant thing.  I said, “You got to be kidding” to the doctor.  “You got to be kidding.”  Up your nose and then we hang a right, and it goes down here.  And then we’ll wiggle it around here, under your eye.  And then we’ll pull it out and we’ll say — I said, “No, that’s — there’s no way that can happen.  Is that the way it goes?  You sure?”  This was a very unpleasant test.
And then I was tested a few weeks later with the new test that just came out, the Abbott, where they just touch your nose, basically.  And they put it in a machine, and literally, a few minutes later, they tell you if you’re fine.  And I was lucky in both cases, because I’ve seen the damage that this does to people.
But we have great tests.  They’ve really gotten better and better and better as we go along.  But we have a tremendous lab capability — laboratory capability all over the country.  And for some reason, the governors, they’re not — a lot of them are, but some of the governors like to complain, and they’re not using it.  We have tremendous capability.  We’re ready for them.
And, as we go along, just like with ventilators, we’ll get better, more advanced, and, you know, it’ll be — we’ll be able to do things that nobody would have even believed possible.  But we started off with a broken system.  We inherited a broken, terrible system.
And I always say it: Our cupboards were bare.  We had very little in our stockpile.  Now we’re loaded up.  And we also loaded up these hospitals.  And, you know, we’re talking about payment.  We gave billions of dollars’ worth of things to hospitals, and we’ll have to work that out at some point.  In fact, I guess they’re going to be working that out with Congress.
But we loaded up hospitals.  The federal government loaded up hospitals with things to take care of people that are very desperately — we’re not — we weren’t worried about payment at that time.  We said, “You’ll take care of it at the right time.”
But we gave billions and billions and billions of dollars’ worth of medical goods and medicines and equipment to hospitals.  And we’ll — we’ll work it out with them.  But people don’t like to talk about that.
So we have done a job that nobody believed — this was a military and private enterprises march.  We marched — and, unfortunately, with the other side, because they’re viewing it as an election.  “How did President Trump do?”  “Oh, he did, uh, terribly.  Let’s see.  He did — uh, yeah, he did terribly.”  “Oh.”  But we just got them the ventilators that they didn’t have, that they should have had.  We just got them hospital beds by the thousands.  We just got them testing that they don’t even know how to use.  In some cases, they have machines that they’re only using 5 percent and 10 percent of the machine, because they have an advanced machine and they don’t know how to use it.  It can use — it can do much more.  So we’ve had people explain how to use it.
So, I don’t know, I don’t think I do that on the other side.  I don’t — I really don’t.  I think that here we have a crisis that we have to work together, and I hope we’re going to work together.  But we’re moving along, and we’re moving along well.  We’re moving along well.
This should not be a partisan witch hunt — you know? — like the Russia hunt that turned out to be a total phony deal.  Unfortunately, some of these voices, though, are attempting to — to bring this into politics.  And whether it’s testing or ventilators or hospital beds, or other dimensions of our sweeping public health response — we have had a sweeping response.
In speaking to the leaders of other countries this morning, they said, “This is incredible the way you’ve done this so quickly.”  You know, we’re only talking about a few weeks since everybody knew this was such a big problem.  And the rest of the world is watching, and they respect what we’ve done because I don’t think anybody else — I know nobody else could have done what we’ve done.  And we started with garbage.
As our experts said yesterday, America’s testing capability and capacity is fully sufficient to begin opening up the country, totally.  Indeed, our system is by far the most robust and advanced anywhere in the world, by far.  The rest of the world will tell you that.
I spoke this morning to a friend of mine, President Moon of South Korea.  He just won the election.  He won it by a lot.  He had a big victory, which I was happy about.  And he was saying what a great job we’ve done in this country.  I told him the same thing.  He said what a great job we’ve done here in this country.  So I appreciated that.  He had a great — by the way, he had a great victory and we’re very happy about that, from the standpoint of our country.  We’re working very well with them — South Korea.
As we approach — and the approach that we use — but as we approach, hopefully, the downward side of what’s going on, I think you’re going to see some incredible hard facts and evidence that what we did was right.  There’s a lot of talk about herd — the word “herd.”  I don’t want to show you charts of people that went a different way, but it’s scary.  It’s scary.
We would have had, I think, millions of people die had we done a different way.  And I think numbers are just coming out where they’re estimating 60,000 people will die.  That’s horrible.  I always say one person is too much, especially in this case, when it could have been stopped in China.  It could have been stopped in China, before it started, and it wasn’t.  And the whole world is suffering because of it.
But this herd concept — and everybody had to think of it at the beginning, because, look — look at us: We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.  Better than China; better than any country in the world; better than any country has ever had.  We had the highest stock market in history, by far.  And I’m honored by the fact that it has started to go up very substantially.  That’s because the market is smart.  The market is actually brilliant.  I’ve seen it.  And they’re viewing it like we’ve done a good job.  They view it that way.
Because if you would have told me that we’re at 24,000 or beyond, and the highest we were ever was — we never hit 30.  We were getting close to 30, so let’s say around 29,000.  We’re at 24.  If we were heading down, I would start to say, “Oh, wow, we may be heading into territory where I started.”  I didn’t like that.  Now we’re way up.  But if you would have said to me with what we’ve gone through — not caused by our country or our people or any — I mean, not caused by certainly anybody within our country.  But if you would have said that, after going through this horrible plague, that we’d have a stock market that’s much, much higher than when I started, much higher than where I started — and I think it’s — you know, I think we have tremendous momentum.  We have a big election coming up, but I think we have tremendous momentum.
First, we get rid of the plague.  And because of what we’re doing with the PPP, what we’re doing with the Paycheck, as we call it, I think we have a chance to have these companies get back to action quickly.
But our approach to testing is based on facts, data, and very hard evidence, not partisan agendas or coordinated political talking points.
Mike Pence, who’s a phenomenal guy, he’s making the commencement address right now at the Air Force Academy, where they’re being very politically correct.  Everyone is standing not 6 feet but 10 feet apart.  Okay?  And it’s very different.  I made that speech last year.  I’m going to West Point.  I think they’re changing the date to June 13th because of what’s going on in New York.  They’re moving into June 13th.  West Point.
So I’m doing their commencement speech, and they’re going to have — it’s sad because — but it’s a big start — they’re going to have the cadets.  They may not have the parents, but they’re going to have the cadets.  The parents are so proud of them.  I know at the Air Force Academy, where Mike is speaking right now, they don’t have the parents; they have the cadets.  They’re very, very widespread.
And you talk about social distancing — I mean, they are really spread.  I looked at it.  They using 10 feet.  So he’s — he’s doing that.  But they’re having it.  It’s very important to have it.  And that’s a great thing.  That’s a great thing.  That’s a big start.
So he’s there right now.  And I will tell you, they — he’s a gentleman, Mike Pence.  A real gentleman.  And they requested — the Democrat senators requested a phone call with him yesterday.  And I think they had, for the most part, all of them on — like, approximately 47.  I heard it was just about all of them, whatever it might be.  I don’t want to be wrong by 1 or 2 or 10 and have the press say, “He lied.  He told a lie.  Terrible, terrible.”  Whatever it was.  But they have 47, and I guess most of them were on.
I heard they were so rude.  I used a term today — I said, rude and nasty.  But I heard they were so rude.  No matter what he said, which was all very positive in terms of winning this battle against the invisible enemy — no matter what he said, they were fresh.  They were nasty.
And it was, I heard, just a terrible thing.  And I said, “Mike, that’s politics.  That’s what it is.”  If we came into this room today and said, “The battle is over.  We have won.  It’s 100 percent gone.”  The Democrats would say, “The President has done a horrible job.  He has done a disgraceful job.  It is a shame how bad he is.”
You know, it’s — it’s — this is the talking points; this is political.  And it would be nice not to have that, especially when we’ve done the job we’ve done.  I mean, all you have to do is look at the big — the big “V” for victory or “V” for ventilator.  Take a look at it.  Everybody said they had us on that; they had us.  They thought they had us, but we got them done at numbers that nobody would have believed.
And we did use our Act, our Production Act, and we used it.  But didn’t use it — we didn’t need it like a hammer.  All we had to do — for the most part — we used it, actually, in a number of cases.  But for the most part, all we had to do is talk about it.  All we had to do is say, “We’re going to use it if you don’t do this.”  And everybody was, you know, for the most part, good.  We used it a couple of times because it didn’t work out the easy way, but it worked out the hard way.
But whether it was masks or ventilator, it was incredible what we’ve been able to do.  So this is a very critical time for the American people, and the American people deserve real information, and responsible and thoughtful dialogue from their elected leaders and from the media.
The media has been — some very honest, but some very dishonest.  You know that.  You know that.  I mean, I even read a story where Mark Meadows — a tough guy — he was crying; he was crying.  This was a Maggie Haberman.  You know, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of Russia, but she was wrong on Russia.  So was everyone else.  They should all give back their Pulitzer Prizes.
In fact, it turned out that the crime was committed by the other side.  The crime was not committed by this side; it was committed by the other side — a bunch of bad people.  You saw the reports coming out over the last two weeks.  They got caught.  So Maggie Haberman gets a Pulitzer Prize?  She’s a third-rate reporter.  New York Times.
And we put her name up here last week.  You saw that.  People thought it was a commercial.  It wasn’t a commercial.  It was like a commercial, but it wasn’t a commercial.  It was just clips.  And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said Mark Meadows was crying.  And they made it sound — I said, “Mark” — and it’s okay if he did.  I wouldn’t — you know, look.  But I think he was crying probably — really, for the wrong reason they had it down.  But he’s not a crier.  And if he was — I know criers.  I could tell you people that you know that are very famous.  They cry, and that’s okay too.
But it was a nasty story in so many ways.  It was fake news.  And she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter.  She is.  I’ve known her for a long while.  I haven’t spoken to her in a long time.  I made the mistake: I take a picture with her at the desk, a long time ago.  Every time she does a story, if I say — I haven’t spoken to her in long — many, many, many months, maybe years.  I don’t speak to her.  She’s fake.  A lot of people are fake.  A lot of people  We got a lot of fake people.
But what happens is she writes this story as retribution.  Puts it in the New York Times.  And the New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper.  It’s my opinion.  It’s not an opinion.  It’s actually, from my standpoint — you know, the very hard thing to figure, though: Most people wouldn’t know that, but I know it because I know the facts.
And they make up — I said it today; they make up words.  “Sources say…” Most often used: “Sources say…”  You know what “sources say” means?  “Sources say” means they have nobody.  And they make it up.  Okay?
And they have a few other type statements that mean the same thing.  But “sources say” is the most often-used express- — in the Washington Post; New York Times, especially; CNN — fake news.  CNN.
They should really be mandated, and I mean mandated to use a name.  If there’s a source, use a name.  Say that Kayleigh — “Kayleigh McEnany said…” or somebody.  And you’d find out that the — number one, the source wouldn’t say it.  The sources don’t exist.  I don’t believe the sources exist.
And I try and tell this — you know, the beautiful thing about doing these conferences is that we have tremendous numbers of viewers, and I’m able to reach the viewers without having to go through fake news, where they make a good story into a bad story.
So, with all of that, it’s been an incredible period of time.  We’ve done a fantastic job.  We’re the talk of other nations.  The leaders of other nations are calling us for help.  They’re calling us for equipment.  They’re calling us for testing capacities.
Now, with the testing, we are going further.  Deborah is going to talk about that now.  With the testing, we have some other tests coming up that are going to be, I think, phenomenal.  I think they’re going to blow away everything as soon as they come out, and we’re going to get them out as soon as possible.
But I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words about where we’ve come, how far we’ve come, and more importantly, where we’re going from this point.  Because honestly, it’s — it’s quite amazing.  Thank you very much.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  If we could have the first slide.
I wanted to give you an update on where we are as states and as counties and as cities.  I know you all are watching carefully.  The numbers have shifted over the last few days.  What happens when nations — when states change the reporting from “confirmed” to “probable”?  So now all probable cases are included.  They had to add them back in.  Even though the cases may have been from March, they were added over 14, 15, and 16th of April, and states may continue to be adding them.  Eventually, we’re hoping that those get accounted for on the day when the presumptive cases or the probable cases were counted.  But right now, they’re added in, in one fell swoop.
So this is New York and New Jersey, and I think we all know how difficult and what a difficult time both New York and New Jersey have had.  I call your attention to the axis; it goes up to 250,000 cases.  So you can get a frame of how we’re talking about some of the other metro areas.
Next slide.
This is the 25 metro areas — the top 25 metro areas.  And you can only see the New York metro area in this slide.  Again, the axis goes up to about 300,000.  It includes the New Jersey part of the metro area, as well as part of southern Connecticut.
Next slide.
But if I take New York out — and the reason I wanted to do that — now the axis is one-tenth of the previous axis.  So that previous ax- — the previous slide, 300,000.  This slide, 30,000.  So that will give you a frame of reference for some of these other metros.
The reason I wanted to show you this is this is cumulative cases.  And we are still tracking, very closely, the issues in Chicago and Boston.  But on this slide, I hope you can see the yellow line; that is Detroit.  And Detroit and this mayor of Detroit has really done an extraordinary job, and the people of Detroit have done an extraordinary job with their social distancing.
The other line I want to call your attention to is the line here.  This is New Orleans.  And I think — frankly, I was concerned about New Orleans because they had a lot of preexisting comorbidities.  They only — they have two or three major hospitals, but a large cover, a very large area of geographic area.
And that other blue line that you can see — it’s down right here — that’s the Seattle line.  And you can see that their response, because of the nursing home alert, they were one of the first states and the first metro areas to really move to social distancing.  And so they’ve really never had a peak, like many of the other metros.
Next slide.
Then I just want to take you through some of these new case graphics.  That was cumulative cases.  This is daily cases.  And obviously, there’s a lot of variability, and variability in reporting, but you get a sense over time, when you look at daily cases.
So New Orleans is on the — on panel on your left, and Baton Rouge on your right.  But you can see clearly, New Orleans, about a month ago, very low levels, probably less than 50 cases.  Large peak and spike around the beginning of April.  And they have come down, and they have it down to very few cases.  Again, I showed you before how both their syndromic cases have come down, as well as their actual case — number of cases.
Next slide.
This is Seattle.  So you can see they had a much lower peak.  And this is — when we talked about flattening the curve, this is what flattening the curve looks like.  It becomes a longer, slower decline, but it ever gets very high, and then goes back down.
Next slide.
And then this is Detroit.  And we always look at the metros as a consolidated.  So this is both Wayne and Oakland in Michigan.  And we really want to thank the mayor for the incredible job that they have done to really ensure that everyone is receiving the adequate healthcare and testing, and they’ve done quite a good job with testing in Michigan.
But all of these states — Louisiana and New York have tested 30,000 per million inhabitants.  Those are some of our highest numbers across the board.
And next slide.
And so the President talked about the case fatality rates, and we really — we’ve lost a lot of Americans to this disease, and we pray and hope for each one of them that are in the hospitals and the excellent care.
What this graph illustrates is the amazing work of the American people to really adhere to social distancing.  This was some — this was nothing we had ever attempted to do as a nation, and the world hadn’t attempted to do.  But they were able to decrease the number of cases so that, in general, most of the metro areas never had an issue of complete crisis care of all of their hospitals in the region.
And so you can see our case fatality rate is about half to a third of many of the other countries.
THE PRESIDENT:  And, excuse me, does anybody really believe this number?  Does anybody really believe this number?
DR. BIRX:  I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this could be.  When highly developed healthcare delivery systems — the United Kingdom and France and Belgium and Italy and Spain — with extraordinary doctors and nurses and equipment have case fatality rates in the 20s, up to 45, and Belgium’s extraordinarily competent healthcare delivery system, and then China at .33, you realize that these numbers, even — and this includes the doubled number out of Wuhan.
And so I wanted, really, to put it in perspective, but I wanted you also to see how great the care has been for every American that has been hospitalized and how extraordinary work of our doctors and nurses in our laboratorians on the front line who have been doing an excellent job.
Next slide.
And then we also wanted to show —
THE PRESIDENT:  If I might add, though, also —
DR. BIRX:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  — the number for Iran.  Does anybody really believe that number?  You see what’s going on over there.  Does anybody — put that slide back, if you would.  Does anybody believe this number?  Does anybody believe this number?  You saw more bags —
DR. BIRX:  And this is why —
THE PRESIDENT:  — on television than that.
DR. BIRX:  This is why the reporting is so important.  And I think you remember, almost six weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was telling you what Italy was showing to us and what France was telling to us, and the warnings that they gave to us and said, “Be very careful.  There’s an extraordinary high mortality among people with preexisting conditions.”  And we used their information to bring that to the American people.
That came — that alert — that alert, before we even had significant cases, came from our European colleagues on the front line.  And that’s why we keep coming back to how important, in a pandemic and a new disease, it’s really critical to have that level of transparency because it changes how we work as a nation.  It allowed us on — over March 15 to make an alert out there about vulnerable individuals and the — really, they need to protect them, and my call-out to millennials to really protect their parents, protect their grandparents, and get that information out to everyone that there were preexisting conditions that put people at greater risk.  That information came from our European colleagues who were in the midst of their battle themselves.
And so there is never an excuse to not share information.  When you are the first country to have an outbreak, you really have a moral obligation to the world to not only talk about it, but provide that information that’s critical to the rest of the world to really respond to this credibly.
And I really want to thank our European colleagues who have worked so hard to get us that information, even in the midst of their own tragedies.  And I think that really shows how important transparency is.
And we go to the next slide.
We can show you this really encouraging and great news: So we know that fatalities will continue to lag because people are in hospitals still, and some are still sit in intensive care units.
But these COVID-like illnesses — this is our hospitalizations that are related to flu per 100,000 Americans.  This is this year’s flu season.  And you can see our COVID-like illnesses.  And this is all of them, probable and confirmed cases.  Our hospitalizations are declining.
Now, I showed you metros that have made tremendous progress, and we’ve been up here many times talking about it being 6, 10, 15 additional cities.  And now we’re really just focused on Chicago and Boston and Massachusetts, and really some issues that Providence is starting to improve now.  So their relationship to the two large outbreak cities.  But this is really reassuring to us, the progress we’re making across the country against this disease.
And I’m — just really want to conclude by thanking again the American people for making these type of graphics possible; thank the data team who puts these together for me.  So they are working until about 3:30 every morning to make sure that we have the most up-to-date information.  That’s the data that goes to our supply-chain individuals to ensure that every hospital in every state and every community has what they need based on data, and to make sure that we’re serving the needs of the American people as effectively as possible.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.  Fantastic job.  Is this yours?
DR. BIRX:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
The fact is that we’ve been learning a lot from Deborah and Tony and so many of the professionals, the director.
PEPFAR: We’re spending — the United States, without help, to the best of my knowledge — mostly in Africa, $6 billion a year.  And that’s on AIDS.  What we’ve done for AIDS in Africa is unbelievable.  We spend $6 billion a year.  That’s been going on for a long time.  Nobody knows that; you’ve never heard that.  I’ve never heard that.  Six billion dollars a year.
Millions of people are living right now, and living very comfortably, because of the fact that we have found the answer to that horrible, horrible plague.  That was a plague.
But we spent $6 billion a year.  And from what I hear, it’s very well spent, done by professionals, including this great professional right here.  That was the thing that you worked hardest on and something that was very close to her heart.  So it’s — you know, it’s something that I think people should start hearing.
The World Health Organization: We’re just finding more and more problems.  And we spend this money really well.  There are other ways we can spend the $500 million.  That’s $500 million; this is $6 billion.  But we can find other ways to spend it where people are going to be helped, we think, in a much greater — in a much greater way.
We’re doing some research on certain people that take a lot of credit for what they do.  And NIH is giving away a lot of money — a lot of money.  We’d give away for years — for many years, they’d give away a lot of money.  And some people complain and some people don’t.  Some people are extremely happy.  So we’re looking into that also.
They’re giving away approximately, as I understand it, recently, more than $32 billion a year.  Thirty-two billion.  And so we’ve been looking at that for a while, and we’re going to be having some statements to be made about that.  Thirty-two billion dollars a year.  It’s a lot of money, and we want to make sure it’s being spent wisely.  And we’ve been doing that, by the way, and we’ll have some statements on that.
And those are much bigger numbers then what we’re talking about with national — if you — if you look, with the — with our friends from wherever they come from.  You know, 500 — 500 million is a lot of money, but it’s not a lot compared to the kind of money that we give out.  I think, over the years, it’s been averaging about 32 billion dollars.  Thirty-two billion.  So we’ve had our eye on that one for a while.
We also talked about the lab in China where, I guess, $3.7 million was given some time ago.  And we’re looking at that very closely.  Chief of Staff has that pretty much under control.  But it’s money that — too bad it got spent there.  But that was spent — what year was that, Mark?  That was four or five years ago?
MR. MEADOWS:  That was over the last six years.  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Six years ago, approximately.  So we’re looking at that.  And that’s the lab that people are talking about.
All right, so we’re looking at a lot of things.  There’s tremendous waste in our government.  We found it in many different ways and in many different forms.  And this is one of them.  This is one of them.
We can spend — I was talking to Dr. Birx — we can spend $500 million using all of it in a much more efficient manner if we’re — if we choose to do that.  And it’ll be to the good of many more people than are getting it right now.
But you look at the mistakes that were made — I mean, so late, long after I said we have to close off our country.  They were actually against our closing off our country to China.  When I did that in January, they were against that.  They didn’t like the idea of closing off our country.  They said it was a bad thing to do, actually, and they’ve since taken that back.  But it was a very lucky thing that we did it.  Very lucky.  We would have had numbers that were very significantly greater.  Tony Fauci said that.  He said it would have been very significantly greater had we not done that.
So we’ve made a lot of moves that were good moves, but it’s still a very depressing subject because it’s a lot of death.  And if it was stopped very early on at the source, before it started blowing into these proportions, you have 184 countries that would have been in a lot better shape.  But our country is getting back, and I expect that we’re going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.
All right, we’ll take a few questions.  Jeff.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-2/

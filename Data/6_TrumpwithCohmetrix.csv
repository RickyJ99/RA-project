100,Trump,2020-12-16 08:11:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany | 12/15/2020, #41",Nan,"
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Yesterday, the United States witnessed a medical miracle: The first doses of a COVID vaccine were administered to frontline workers across the country.  The President promised a safe and effective vaccine in record time, and President Trump delivered.
Earlier this year, we heard from several news outlets and so-called fact checks that President Trump would need, quote, “a ‘miracle’ to be right.”  That was an NBC News article.  We were told, according to Healthline, quote, a vaccine will “still take more than a year to develop.”  USA Today warned us that, quote, “despite medical researchers’ progress,” a vaccine, quote, was “more than a year away.”  And National Geographic even told us that achieving a vaccine within, quote, “a year to 18 months would be absolutely unprecedented,” end quote.  These reports deserve their own fact check: false.
President Trump has not only been the optimist, hopeful to achieve a vaccine by year’s end, he has also been a leader.  Through Operation Warp Speed, President Trump, the businessman and the President, as the innovator, has succeeded.  President Trump directed military logistics experts at the Department of Defense to partner with health experts at Health and Human Services to ensure prompt delivery of vaccines and equipment.  This includes the appointment of four-star General Perna, who oversees the global supply chain and readiness for the United States Army as Operation Warp Speed’s chief operating officer.
The Trump administration supported clinical trials by working to enroll participants through NIH-funded COVID protection networks and provided funding and technical support through the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
President Trump also directed industrial-scale manufacturing of vaccines to take place at its own risk before knowing whether these vaccines would be successful.  It was a novel approach, indeed, to vaccine development, and led by President Trump.
The results of these historic investments will benefit the American people and will mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic.  As the first doses of the vaccine are delivered and administered, we urge all Americans to continue to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you are unable to do so.
We also encourage those at the state level to improve the early and aggressive use of monoclonal antibody treatments, especially among vulnerable Americans.
The Trump administration led the way, approving monoclonal antibody treatments for outpatient use, issuing two emergency use authorizations in November.  Additionally, through HHS’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, monoclonal antibody patient courses have been allocated to all 50 states.  Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus.  Thank you to President Trump.
And, with that, I will take questions.

145,Trump,2020-12-02 08:05:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany,Nan,"
     MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  The United States Constitution matters even during a pandemic.  While Democrat politicians seek to impose draconian restrictions against their citizens, this past week the Supreme Court of the United States had their say on New York State’s capacity restrictions, which restricted the number of attendees allowed in places of worship but not other government-deemed essential businesses.
     Justice Gorsuch, in the ruling, said this as he rolled back Governor Cuomo’s restrictions on places of worship.  He said, quote, “It is time — past time — to make plain that, while the pandemic poses many grave challenges, there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores and bike shops but shutter churches, synagogues, and mosques.”
     Behind me, you will see displayed images of Democrat hypocrisy playing on loop.  These images depict the following: 
     They show Governor Gavin Newsom of California dining both mask-less and indoors at the fancy French Laundry restaurant despite severe lockdown restrictions against indoor dining for the very people he governs.
     You’ll see Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot celebrating in the non-socially distanced streets of her city.
     You will see Speaker Nancy Pelosi indoors at a hair salon in San Francisco when salons in California were only open for outdoor services.
     And you will see CNN’s Chris Cuomo staging his emergence from quarantine in a made-for-television moment, coming out of the basement.  And this was after Cuomo was spotted breaking his brother, Governor Cuomo’s quarantine rules to go for a bike ride in the Hamptons.
     Also notable is San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who followed Governor Newsom’s lead in dining at the French Laundry with a group of eight people.
     And, finally, Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl dining outdoors at her favorite Santa Monica restaurant after voting to ban outdoor dining at 31,000 restaurants throughout LA, calling outdoor dining “a most dangerous situation.”
     Quite clearly, these Democrats do not follow their own edicts.  They act in a way that their own citizens are barred from acting.
     Governor Cuomo’s decision to impose restrictions on the size of religious gatherings was rebuked by the highest court in the land.  But what was Cuomo’s response?  Instead of showing deference to the Constitution, he attacked the legitimacy of the Court.  Governor Cuomo said this: “You have a different Court, and I think that was the statement that the court was making.  We know who he appointed to the court.  We know their ideology.”
     Well, in fact, the ideology of those on the Supreme Court who made the decision to support the First Amendment are in favor of freedom, the Constitution that survives even during a pandemic.
     This statement from Governor Cuomo strikes at the heart of the issue: Democrats seek control.  These images behind me make clear Democrats’ mindset: rules for thee but not for me.
     The President stands with you, your freedom, your ability to decide how to best protect your health.  We all know how to protect ourselves from COVID-19: wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask.
     But as one federal court put it, “There is no pandemic exception to the Constitution.”
     And with that, I’ll take questions.
     Welcome back, Kristen.  Good to have you back.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-120220/

MS. MCENANY: Good afternoon, everyone. The beginning of the end of the pandemic started with the leadership of President Trump. In recent days, Pfizer and Moderna reported the highly successful results of their vaccine development, each achieving a COVID vaccine that is over 90 percent effective. We know Moderna is 94.5 percent effective; Pfizer 95 percent. That is extraordinary.
In July, the Trump administration, as part of Operation Warp Speed, agreed to provide Pfizer with $1.95 billion to manufacture and distribute their COVID vaccine, allowing this vaccine to be provided free for the American people.
While Democrats were pursuing a highly divisive and entirely baseless impeachment endeavor, as far back as January 13th, this President, the Trump administration, and the National Institute of Health was partnering with Moderna and working on this vaccine for the American people.
But that’s not all: This administration has remained engaged on the development and distribution of a safe and effective vaccine throughout the year. It began in January and continued thereafter.
On May 15th, Operation Warp Speed was launched. On September 16th, we released two documents outlining a strategy to deliver a safe and effective vaccine. These documents were the strategic — strategic distribution overview in the Interim Playbook for state, tribal, territorial, and local health programs and partners.
On September 23rd, we provided $200 million to jurisdictions to support plans for eventual distribution.
On October 14th, we provided $31 million to Cytiva for vaccine-related consumable products.
On October 16th, we made agreements with CVS and Walgreens to administer vaccines to residents of long-term care facilities.
On October 21st, under the PREP Act, we issued guidance authorizing qualified pharmacy technicians to administer the vaccine.
On October 30th, we announced that McKesson Corporation will produce, store, and distribute vaccine ancillary supply kits on behalf of the Strategic National Stockpile to help healthcare workers who will administer the vaccines.
And on November 12th, we announced the partnership with large chain pharmacies and independent regional ones to deliver safe and effective vaccines.
The unprecedented response to this pandemic has already saved many American lives. And as you can see, this timeline was ongoing. This was a long process and one that we are very proud of.
Now, with multiple safe and effective vaccines just around the corner, we urge all Americans to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when you cannot do so.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

163,Trump,2020-11-19 11:40:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force | November 19, 2020",Nan,"

THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  We just completed our second meeting this week with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  And we’ve continued — we’ve continued to be on the same mission we’ve been on throughout the course of this year, and that is to save American lives and to work every day toward that day that we put the coronavirus in the past.
I’m joined today, and you’ll hear in a few moments, from members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, including those that are leading the effort of distribution of vaccinations under Operation Warp Speed.  And I think you will be as impressed as I was at FEMA earlier today when I heard the detailed plans for the virtually immediate distribution of vaccines when they become approved and available to the American people.
From very early in this pandemic, at the President’s direction, we have followed an approach to this pandemic that was federally supported, state managed, and locally executed.  And to that end, this past Monday, we completed our 41st conference call with all of the nation’s governors — every state, every territory.  And there, we spoke about our current circumstances where we see cases and hospitalizations rising, but we also continue to speak to them about — about the expansion of testing, the availability of supplies, and our ongoing efforts to continue to drive forward toward the development and the distribution of a vaccine for the American people.
As we gather here today, with cases and hospitalizations rising across the country, President Trump directed us to host this briefing, to describe the ongoing work of our task force and our partnership with state and local officials and our partners in the private sector to continue to put the health of America first.
But first, let me begin simply by saying that our hearts and our prayers are with all of those families that have been impacted by the coronavirus over the course of the past 10 months.  And let me say personally: Not a day has gone by that I haven’t thought personally about families that have lost loved ones.  And I want to assure each of you that you will always be in our hearts and you will remain in our prayers.
But we wanted to take this opportunity also to thank the American people for the extraordinary sacrifices that you’ve made over the course of the past 10 months.  We’ve been through a lot together.  We went through 45 days to slow the spread, back when the positivity rate across this country was more than 20 percent.  We managed to accomplish our objective: We slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, and we saved lives.
And then, during the outbreak across the Sun Belt this summer, when we saw positivity rise to nearly 10 percent, the American people, officials at the federal and state level stepped up again, and we put that outbreak in the past.
And even as we see help on the way, the vaccines being developed at a historic pace, as I mentioned before, as we gather today, we are seeing cases and positivity rising across the country.
But we approach this moment with the confidence of experience.  We know the American people know what to do.  We have forged a partnership that is truly seamless with state and local health authorities.  And as we’ll describe to you today, we’ve continued to work seven days a week, all throughout this year and up to this very moment, to make sure the American people have access to the healthcare that we’d want any member of our family to have as we meet this pandemic.
Now, cases are rising throughout the country.  Positivity in the last 30 days has risen from an average of 5 percent to 10 percent.  And to that end, we’ve continued the mobilization that began at President Trump’s direction early this year.  We increased testing from a standing start in the month of February to now, as of today, we’ve completed more than 170 million tests, and we continue to approve new tests, including an at- home test that the FDA just recently approved.  And we’re distributing more than 150 million Binax tests to schools and nursing homes around America as we speak.
Our mobilization of supplies you will hear described in great detail continues to surge each and every day.  We actually are able to track PPE and supplies on a hospital-by-hospital basis.  And so we’re carefully monitoring.  We’re working with state officials, with hospital administrators, to make sure that our hospitals have the support they need.
Also, as we gather, more than 140 clinical trials for therapeutics continue to be underway, but effective therapies are already available and are widely known among the American people.  And for those over the age of 70, we’re proud to report that we actually have decreased the fatality rate by more than 70 percent since those heartbreaking days of April.
In May of this year, of course, as the President spoke last week in the Rose Garden, we launched Operation Warp Speed, focusing on accelerating the development, the manufacture, and the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine.  And you’ll have an update today on the progress from two of our leading experts and those that are coordinating Operation Warp Speed.
What I want to say in the midst of all of this to the American people, as we begin this briefing, is that with the — with a massive increase in testing over the last 10 months, with PPE and medical supplies and equipment that are available to the American people, with the medicines and the therapeutics and, very soon, the vaccines that are available, America has never been more prepared to combat this virus than we are today.
And our pledge to each and every American looking on today is we’re going to work around the clock to keep it that way.  We’re going to make sure that hospitals that are seeing patients coming in on an increasing basis know that we’re going to — we’re going to work around the clock to meet that need.  And you have our continuing pledge and the practice of experience that we’ve had along the way.
So, in a few moments, you’ll hear from members of our team.  We’re going to begin with Dr. Deborah Birx, who’s going to describe what we’re seeing in the rising cases.  Literally every day, for members of the task force, begins with detailed analysis of what’s happening across the country.  And she’ll give you our very best — our very best information on rising cases and hospitalizations.  And that information is summarized each and every week for the nation’s governors and provided to them in particular detail as well.
After Dr. Birx speaks, we’ve asked General David Sanford with FEMA to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to provide PPE and medical supplies to our hospital needs.  We’re literally going to make sure, as I said, that as we see cases rising, that we’re meeting the needs in hospitals around America to stand up the response that any one of us would want a family member to be able to have access to.
Then we’ve asked Dr. Fauci to give us an update on the incredible and historic progress on the development of vaccines.  It seems like, with good news happening every couple of days, that’s a great encouragement to the American people.
And then, General Gus Perna will outline our distribution plans on Operation Warp Speed.  I was at FEMA today and received a detailed briefing about our distribution plans.  And I asked General Perna to come here today to make that presentation to the American people.  And it is, in a very real sense, putting us in a position that literally, the day after one of these vaccines is approved, we’ll be shipping vaccines to the American people.  And within a day after that, we’ll be seeing those vaccines injected into Americans with a particular focus on those most vulnerable and those that are providing healthcare to the American people.
Finally, we’ll talk with — a bit about the way forward.  As state and local governments are continuing to act and take mitigation measures to slow the spread, you can assure them, as we did governors again this week, that we’ll support decision making at the local level.  And we’ll continue to support decisions that are made in each individual community based on the circumstances on the ground.
But that being said, President Trump wanted me to make it clear that our task force, this administration, and our President does not support another national lockdown.
And we do not support closing schools.  You’ll hear from Dr.  Robert Redfield of the CDC that, actually, the CDC never recommended that we close schools at any point this year.  And Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, who also serves with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services at HHS, will describe the real cost to children being away from school.
But in every one of these cases, we’re going to give you the best information that we have up to this moment.  And I just want to assure the American people, as I trust that you will have a sense today, that we’re going to continue to work around the clock to meet this moment.
But help is on the way.  We have every confidence that, in a short period of time, we could have one or more safe and effective vaccines for the American people.  And as each of us does our part in partnership with state and local officials, and each of us does our part to look after our own families and our own communities, I believe the day is coming soon when we will put this coronavirus in the past.
But with that, let me introduce Dr. Deborah Birx, who will update us on cases.  And after that — after that, we will get a presentation on the availability of supplies that we continue to make available to hospitals and healthcare providers around the country.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  And it’s really a moment that we want to call on every American to increase their vigilance.  And I want to go through some data about why we are asking people from Elko, Nevada, through Denver, Colorado, to Philadelphia; from Madison, Wisconsin, to El Paso, Texas, and across this great nation to really increase their vigilance at this moment.
I want to thank the governors and mayors and county commissioners that I’ve had the privilege to talk to over the last four and a half months of being on the road.
We can have the first slide, please.
The number of universities — 42 states, 30 universities, and a large number of chairmen from our tribal nations.  The reason we wanted to really be in here is to really understand the reality on the ground, what they were facing, and understand how we could be more supportive.  And this is really a call to action for every American to increase their vigilance because of the graphic that is shown here.
I wanted to show you the difference in slopes between the spring surge, the summer surge, and the fall surge so the American people know that this is more cases more rapidly than what we had seen before, but to also make it clear, like before, we do know what to do.  And we’re asking every American to do those things today.
The next slide shows our increase in test positivity.  The light brown bars are the number of tests that were performed.  But even with the number — an ever-increasing number of tests performed, you can see the increase in test positivity to around 10 percent.  In some areas of the country, it is much higher than that, and it illustrates the ongoing community spread in your counties, in your small and large metros, and in your rural areas.
The next slide really shows the country as a whole and why we’re asking every American to remain vigilant, to do those things that we have been asking you all to do: to wear a mask, to physically distance, to continue your hand hygiene, but really, in this moment of bringing people together, to really limit interactions indoors to immediate households when we see this level of community spread.
Behind this level of community spread is a lot of asymptomatic cases.  People are spreading the virus because they don’t know they’re infected with the virus, and so people are coming together indoors.  Everyone looks healthy, but among those individuals could be individuals that already are infected, have no symptoms, and are unknowingly spreading the virus to others.
It is because of this asymptomatic spread that we have asked people to wear a mask indoors and to ask people to wear a mask when among others.  But sometimes when we go indoors and we’re with friends and family, we just assume that if you look okay, you are okay.  And now we know that over 50 percent of the individuals, particularly among those under 35, many could be infected and unknowingly spreading the virus.
This virus increased so rapidly because there was an unusual cold snap that began in the Northern Plains and went down through the Heartland where, in the end of September/ beginning of October, large number of people moved indoors.  So we’ve been going across the country to really tell them that, in the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast, to really increase testing, looking for these asymptomatic cases.
And I really want to thank the governors across this great land who have really heeded that call and set up what we call sentinel populations — whether it’s nursing home staff, K-through-12 teachers; whether it’s community college students, county workers, specific businesses — to really have routine weekly testing so that we can see the spread of this virus down to the zip code and really combat that with additional mitigation.
The next slide shows what we have been talking about, about the level of hospitalizations.  And in this slide you can see the hospitalizations by the darkness of the color.  And I just want to make it clear what the Vice President talked about: We now can see every admission every day.  And I want to thank the hospitals who, from July, have been sending us that data and improving that data, and working with CDC so that we can see new admissions, we can see inpatient status, we can see CCU — ICU status, and we can see who’s being admitted by age group.  Right now, it’s about 50/50 between those between 40 and 69 and those over 70.
But you can see that we have some areas of the country in the hot red, bright pink.  And these are — the darkest red are those states that have more than 21 percent of their hospitals are COVID patients, and the light pink is between 16 and 20 percent, and the light orange between 12 and 15 percent.
But you do see that there’s still states in the green areas.  And to all of those states that have not seen this surge: to really increase your testing among asymptomatics by setting up these sentinel populations.
When we did the 45 days to stop the spread and we asked each state to follow the gating criteria, part of that gating criteria included looking for asymptomatic cases.  With these new antigen tests, we have the capacity to really expand testing to find those cases and stop that spread.
In the meantime, as we started with, we stopped the surge in the south through very targeted mitigations that start with masks, that start with physical distancing, but also include decreasing those friends and family gatherings where people come together and unknowingly spread the virus.
And I want to thank the mayors of Miami — Miami City and Miami County — who — they were the ones that first, in the summer, really found how much asymptomatic spread was occurring in household gatherings.
And so, as you bring together individuals, remember what the Vice President talked about: Every American needs to be vigilant in this moment because we know that when you are, we can mitigate this virus and stop this spread together.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Dr. Birx.  And as you can see, with particularity on a state-by-state basis, we are — want the American people to know that we have — we have eyes on your local hospital.  We know about admissions.  We know about the availability of ICU beds.  And we know about supplies.
And from very early on, at the President’s direction, we stood up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two.  And I want the American people to know that that continues to this moment.
And General David Sanford, who has been with us every step of the way, is going to brief you on the status of our supply chain and the reserves that we have in our ongoing efforts to make sure that our hospitals and healthcare facilities have the resources and the support to meet this moment.
General?
BRIGADIER GENERAL SANFORD:  Mr. Vice President, thank you, sir.  Dr. Birx, thank you, ma’am.  So we are in a much better place and continue to improve upon that capability.  You’ll see from the slides behind me that we have — continue to grow our National Stockpile but also our FEMA stocks to meet the requirements laid out by our states and by our populations.  We continue to expand upon these to bridge the vaccine delivery to continue to protect our American population.
Since the late summer, we have grown our personal protective equipment capabilities 10 to 15 times over what they were pre-COVID and continue to grow capability to meet the surge requirements that we may expect from the current caseload.
As you can see behind me, around the third column or fourth column, we have four months of surge capability based on current case diagnosis just for N95 masks.  And we continue to grow that capability — more masks being added every month.
The Strategic National Stockpile and our FEMA stocks are ready to be the backstop when our states require assistance.  And that’s all built upon a foundation of a strong, domestic medical industrial base — something where we’ve been able to expand upon or build, in some cases almost from scratch, using our Defense Production Act and other CARES Act authorities to provide the capabilities for our American people not just now, but into the future and for future crisis or medical events going down.
You can go to next slide, please.
This is not done alone.  We continue to work with our states on a recurring basis.  Our FEMA administrator is constantly engaged with the governors or their staffs.  We reached out to both our regional administrators, to the state medical — or health department officials, and both to the emergency management officials in the state to find out what their needs are to help overcome their challenges and to grow the states’ stockpiles, as that relates to our Federal Emergency Management mandate of local execution, state management, and federal support.
As you saw in the previous slide and as you’ll see on this color-coded map, between our states and the federal government, we stand in a much better position than we were just a month ago, and certainly more than four or five months ago, to meet the surging PPE demands of our nation.
And this is not something that we’re sitting and continuing just to watch; it is something that we’re continuing to grow upon and to continuously analyze so that we can stay ahead of the increases and make sure that we’re either procuring and we have PPE on the way to meet the surge in cases.
I’ll turn it over to Dr. Fauci and General Perna.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Well done.  Well done.
With that, I’m going to invite Dr. Tony Fauci to come up and share his thoughts on the development of a vaccine, which is giving such great hope.  But I trust that the panels that you just showed us encourage the American people to know that we’re going to continue to work around the clock to make sure your local hospital has the resources and the supplies that you need to meet this moment.
But I think we all know that we ultimately put this pandemic in the past the day that we have a safe and effective vaccine.  And we’ve been making historic progress through Operation Warp Speed, with our private partners, and Dr. Tony Fauci and NIH have been absolutely integral to that.
So I’ve asked Dr. Fauci to update you on the status of vaccine development.  And then — and then we will have General Gus Perna, who is coordinating the distribution plan for Operation Warp Speed, working with every state and territory in America to be ready on day one to distribute vaccines as soon as they’re available, to give you a brief outline on that plan.
So, Dr. Fauci.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  As I was sitting there, I was recalling that, about seven or eight months ago, I stood at this exact spot at a time when there was really an extraordinary surge in cases in the northeastern part of the country, in New York City.  And I said that, if the virus was left to its own devices, it would cause a considerable degree of devastation because that’s what pandemic viruses do.  It’s a very powerful force, and you’ve heard about that and what we need to do about it from Dr. Birx.
However, I also said, if some of you can remember, that there’s an opposing force to that, and that opposing force is us: you and I being able to do certain things, like mitigation with public health measures, again, which was just mentioned by Dr. Birx.
But there’s another opposing force to that, and that’s a vaccine.  And historically, if you look at highly efficacious and effective vaccines through the years, they’ve crushed formidable outbreaks like smallpox, like polio, like measles.  So in the next couple of minutes, let me tell you about what we have now and what’s going to happen in the next few months.
As you well know, Operation Warp Speed has been supporting directly and indirectly six candidate vaccines, four of which are either in or completed phase three clinical trial.  I want to briefly tell you about two of them because you have to be interested in this.  It is extraordinarily impressive.
Two of the vaccines, one by Moderna and one by the company Pfizer, have completed trials, and the efficacious — vaccine efficacy point is extraordinary.  With regard to Pfizer, it was 95 percent efficacious not only against disease that’s just clinically recognizable disease, but severe disease.  There were 10 cases of severe disease: one in the vaccine, nine in the placebo.  For the Moderna trial, it was 94.5 percent efficacious.  Eleven severe events: zero in the vaccine, 11 in the placebo.
For those of you not acquainted with the field of vaccinology, that is extraordinary.  That is almost to the level of what we see with measles, which is 98 percent effective.  So that’s what we’re dealing with.
The question is: What about how that is going to be rolled out?  I use the word “efficacious”; that means what happens in a clinical trial.  The word “effective” means is what the ultimate impact of that vaccine is going to be on society, and the only way you can get an effective program is when people take the vaccine.  And we’re going to be talking to you about that.
And I hear a lot now, when we made these announcements this past Monday and then two Mondays ago, about some reticence of people: “Well, did you rush this?”  “Was this too fast?”  “Is it really safe and is it really efficacious?”  The process of the speed did not compromise at all safety, nor did it compromise scientific integrity.  It was a reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances in these types of vaccines, which allowed us to do things in months that actually took years before.  So I really want to settle that concern that people have about that.
“What about the decision of the data?  Who looked at the data?  Was that some force that was maybe trying to put something over on you?”  No, it was actually an independent body of people who have no allegiance to anyone — not to the administration, not to me, not to the companies — that looked at the data and deemed it to be sound.
Now that data will be examined very carefully by the FDA, who, together with an advisory committee — the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VERPAC — are going to look at that before the FDA makes the decision about putting this forth for an emergency use authorization or, ultimately, for a license.
So we need to put to rest any concept that this was rushed in an inappropriate way.  This is really solid.
Now, what does that mean for us?  We now, as the Vice President said, are telling you that help is on the way, which has two aspects to it.  It means that we need to actually double down on the public health measures as we’re waiting for that help to come, which will be soon.  We’ll be getting vaccine doses into people at high priority at the end of December.  We’re not talking about shutting down the country.  We’re not talking about locking down.  We’re talking about intensifying the simple public health measures that we all talk about: mask wearing, stay being distanced, avoiding congregate settings, doing things to the extent that we can outdoors versus indoors.  If we do that, we’ll be able to hold things off until the vaccine comes.
Now, I’ve used that metaphor that “the cavalry is on the way.”  If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting.
And then, finally, one other final thing about it.  The very impressive efficacy — 94.5 and 95 percent of a vaccine — should motivate individual to realize that this is something you want to participate in.  So we’re going to be talking to you about it likely here, in the future, about why it’s important, as these vaccine doses roll out, why we have to do two things: continue the public health measure and get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony.  General?
GENERAL PERNA:  Mr. Vice President, thank you very much for this opportunity.  So I’ve been asked to highlight our way ahead on distribution of the vaccine as just talked about by Dr. Fauci and, before that, Vice President Pence.
You know, we are here today because our mission was clear, and our mission to Dr. Moncef Slaoui — my co-leader and, really, heavily responsible for our success — we are here today because we focused on developing, manufacturing, and distributing a safe and effective vaccine and therapeutics to the American people.  Our purpose is really clear: Save lives.  And it has driven us to this end state, and that’s why we’re here today.
A couple of things as we get started in our planning: I will tell you that the planning began almost immediately following our ceremony in the Rose Garden on the 15 May.  That Monday, we started talking development manufacturing and distribution.  It’s not a thought that we’ve had in the last two weeks.  It’s required extensive planning and detailed work by a collaboration of individuals, which I’ll talk about.
A couple of things we decided up front:
One, we were going to be able to deliver the vaccine within 24 hours after EUA.  That is distribution to the entire United States of America to include territories and metropolitan cities.
Two, we started with a foundation of expertise.  The CDC is the very best at planning and executing distribution of vaccines.  We took their core competency, and we aligned it with the capability of planners, project managers, and those who could run campaigns.  And, together, this organization has come up with our strategy for distribution.
Third, we took the capacity of the industry, commercial industry, and we brought them into the fold.  We wanted to utilize the capability and the capacity that is already established in America, that has a proven track record, that knows how to distribute vaccines, that understands the nuances of ultra-cold chain requirements.  We knew if we brought Pfizer, Moderna, McKesson, UPS, FedEx, CVS, Walgreen, and hundreds others together, that we would come up with the best solutions, because innovation towards our end state was our only care.  It wasn’t about egos and it wasn’t about credit.  It was about how do we solve this complex problem.
It was clear, immediately following our initial meetings with industry, that we had to have full collaboration, to my fourth point, with the jurisdictions and the states.  They had to be a big part of our planning sequence.
So, together, OWS, CDC, industry, and the states and jurisdictions came up with the plan that I’m going to talk to you about here shortly.  It is the effort that is almost so common that you will recognize it because we do it every year.  We do it when we distribute influenza vaccines.  We do it when other vaccines are being distributed.  The difference is now we’re pushing mass volume of a new vaccine, and so we needed to have a strategy that was collaborated at all levels, with all organizations, in order to execute.
The last thing we needed to do was we had to create a system to see ourselves.  We had to be able to see inside of every territory, state, metropolitan city; understand where the vaccine was from fill/finish site to distribution warehouses, down to administration sites, so not only could we maintain the flow of vaccine, but we could account for vaccine that was being administered.  That way, we can keep the flow to the American people in a steady drumbeat.
As we go forward — first slide, please — we will distribute the vaccine accordingly.  I direct you to the right side of the slide.  This is our end state.  This is where we want the vaccines to be.  We want the vaccines down at the places where the American people are comfortable — at our hospitals, our doctor’s offices; down at CVS, Walgreens; down at the long care — healthcare facilities — places where people are comfortable going.  So that’s where we started: end state.
Then we went back to Pfizer and Moderna, we laid out the guidelines that I gave you, and with the collaboration of them and the commercial industry for distribution, we came up with our plan.  It’s relatively simple: We take the Pfizer vaccine.  They are capable of distributing on their own; they will utilize FedEx and UPS, in order to execute distribution.  Simultaneously, we will ship ancillary kits — needles, syringes, alcohol wipes, and the diluent required for the vaccine to meet the vaccine at the end-state facilities that we’re talking about.
For McKesson — or for Moderna vaccine, what we’re going to do is we’re going to meet up the vaccine with the ancillary kits at a distribution warehouse.  We’re going to put them together, and then we’re going to distribute through FedEx and UPS, down to our administration sites.
So, in simple terms, we’re taking it from fill/finish, we’re bringing together all the requirements for administering the vaccine, and then we’re sending it down to the distribution sites.  Any place that a state wants to administer the vaccine, as long as they’re enrolled — right? — into our process, we can distribute the vaccine.  We can distribute the Pfizer vaccine at a minimum of 975 doses, and the Moderna vaccine at a minimum of 100 doses.  We can go to one place in the state or we can go to 10,000 places in the state.  The capability and the capacity exist because we came together in a whole-of-America approach.
It is this effort that I can look you in the face and say to you: EUA comes; 24 hours later, vaccines will be distributed out to the American people and be ready for administration.
To this end, our mission is as I stated: safe and effective vaccines to the American people, and we need to do it in the most timely manner possible because it is all about lives.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, General.  And, General, how many kits have already been started, would you say?
GENERAL PERNA:  Mr. Vice President, we already have over a million kits — both the kits that we’ll need for the Pfizer vaccine, as well as the Moderna vaccines.  Different —
SECRETARY AZAR:  One hundred.
GENERAL PERNA:  One hundred.  Right.  Yes, yeah.  Excuse me, 100 million.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I knew the answer.  I knew the answer.
General Perna, thank you.  And as he said, from the time President Trump announced Operation Warp Speed, General Perna and his team have been working literally around the clock to build the distribution plan that you see that’s in effect.  And I hope you all heard that.  I asked him how many of those kits have already been manufactured for merging with — merging with the Moderna product, and they’ve already assembled 100 million kits that are ready to go.  And that’s the supplies that are necessary for administering the vaccine.
I must tell you, having received my latest briefing today over at FEMA, from Operation Warp Speed, I think every American can be proud of the fact that we have a plan in place: that the moment that the FDA concludes that that vaccine is safe and effective, we have a system in place to begin, within 24 hours, shipping that vaccines to hospitals, healthcare facilities, and 24 hours after that, literally injecting that vaccine into Americans.
And we’ll also be continuing to develop the prioritization working with states about their plans.  And maybe Bob Redfield of CDC will reflect on that as well in a moment.  CDC will create a recommendation for priorities of who’s to be immunized.  But if history is a teacher, we know that we’ll focus on those most vulnerable; we’ll focus on our healthcare workers and first responders at the early going.
But it’s — it’s truly inspiring to me to see the incredible work that Operation Warp Speed has done.  And, General Perna, I want to thank you for your dedication.
With that, as I said, we’ve continued from the very beginning to operate an approach at the federal level that is federally supported, state managed, locally executed.  And we’ll continue to respect decisions that state governments are making in efforts to slow the spread.
But — but to be very clear, as President Trump has been very clear: that we do not support another national lockdown and do not believe it is necessary.  I think Dr. Fauci actually reflected again on we’re not calling for a national lockdown, and we won’t.
But beyond that, there have been some actions taken in jurisdictions around the country with regard to closing schools, and I wanted the American people to know that it is — it is the position of this task force, of this administration, and of the CDC that we do not need to close our schools.
I want to invite Dr. Redfield to come forward to speak about that, but I want to emphasize what he’s reminded our task force of many times: that, actually, at no point in this pandemic has the CDC ever recommended closing schools.  And the more we’ve learned about this virus, the more it’s simply affirmed that we think our kids belong in the classroom.  We’re absolutely committed to continue to provide resources so our kids, our teachers, our administrators can safely — safely get back to school.
But with that, let me introduce Dr. Redfield and, with him, Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz at HHS, who is an extraordinary leader.  She’s going to speak about the unintended consequences of shutting our kids out of the classroom around America.  And then I’ll have the Secretary have some closing remarks.
Dr. Redfield?
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I think it’s important first for me to emphasize what you’ve heard already, is that we’re not defenseless against this virus.  Masks works.  Social distancing works.  Hand washing works.  Being smart about crowds, particularly indoor, works.  The strategic use, as Dr.  Birx said, of testing to identify the silent epidemic, to identify the asymptomatic infection so that they can be pulled out of the transmission cycle, works.
Another point that I want to make is that we need to follow the data.  We should be making data-driven decisions when we talk about what we’re doing for institutions or what we’re doing for commercial closures.
For example, as was mentioned, last spring, CDC did not recommend school closures, nor did we recommend their closures today.  I will say, back in the spring, there was limited data; today, there’s extensive data that we have — we’ve gathered over the last two to three months — to confirm that K-through- 12 schools can operate with face-to-face learning, and they can do it safely and they can do it responsibly.
The infections that we’ve identified in schools, when they’ve been evaluated, were not acquired in schools.  They were actually acquired in the community and in the household.
Today, as Dr. Birx said, our big threat for transmission is not the public square; it’s small family gatherings — family gatherings where people become more comfortable; they remove their face mask and they get together.  And it’s a silent epidemic that begins to transmit.
But it’s not intra-school transmission.  The truth is, for kids K through 12, one of the safest places they can be, from our perspective, is to remain in school.  And it’s really important that — following the data, making sure we don’t make emotional decisions about what to close and what not to close.  And I’m here to say clearly: The data strongly supports that K-through-12 schools, as well as institutes of higher learning, really are not where we’re having our challenges.  And it would be counterproductive, from my point of view — from a public health point of view — just in containing the epidemic, if there was an emotional response to say, “Let’s close the schools.”
Finally, you know, I wanted to echo what has been said by the Vice President and Dr. Fauci, is: We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, where we are to now.  And this is why now more than ever — as was said by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and myself, now more than ever, we’re asking all Americans, all Americans to redouble their efforts to be vigilant, to embrace masks, social distancing, hand washing, our advice about crowds, and really to support using the data to make decisions in their communities, particularly as relates to K-through-12s and institutes of higher learning.  These clearly — the data support that it’s really important, from a public health perspective — both from the pandemic, as well as what you’ll hear about in a minute — that these schools stay open.
Finally, I just want to end on a clear message of confidence: That I’m confident that we’re going to emerge successful and bring this pandemic to an end.  I don’t have any doubt in that.
But today we need — we need all of us to go all in.  Go all in with face coverings, social distancing, hand washing, smartness about crowds, doing our part to help identify the silent epidemic.  And I have confidence that at the end of the day, we’re going to get a very achievable goal, which is to get this pandemic under control.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Elinore?
DR. MCCANCE-KATZ:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  In my role as Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, I feel very strongly about the need to protect and promote the mental health of all Americans.  As a psychiatrist, I’m continually thinking about the mental health effects of this unprecedented situation and how best to mitigate the impact.
Individuals across our country are living with stress that they have likely never experienced.  We must find a way to best alleviate that stress, without ignoring the fact that our nation faces a very real and deadly virus.  I often think about this in the context of our country’s children.  I lead the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, which is the only federal agency whose primary charge is addressing mental and substance use disorders across the country.  Where better to start in addressing this challenge than with our nation’s young people?
Protecting and also fostering the social and emotional wellbeing of children is critical not only to their own development, but also to the development of healthy families, communities, and a healthy and productive society.
The work that schools and school personnel do daily is valuable beyond any words I can deliver.  We know that in addition to education, schools provide our children a profound sense of security and stability.  The structure and safety of schools are integral to our children’s whole health.  The role of the school cannot be overstated.
However, we also cannot overstate the need to address the fear, uncertainty, and safety considerations with returns to school.  I understand that parents and teachers may feel great anxiety.  That is why we must put into place the safety measures we know work: We must use masks.  We must enforce social distancing.  We must employ creative and innovative ways to limit the number of children and teachers in the building at any given time.  There are tools we have, and we must think through how best to use them to keep our schools open.
We know that over 7.4 million children in this country live with serious emotional disturbances, and over 60 percent receive services from the school system.  We know that children with disabilities are losing ground with the closure of schools.  We know that millions of children across the country are experiencing child abuse and neglect that goes undetected due to lack of contact with school personnel who serve as mandatory reporters.  We must work together to address these issues.
I believe strongly that we need schools to open in communities whose data indicate it’s safe to do so.  But we cannot forget the protection of our teachers and school staff.  If they don’t feel it’s safe to return to work, it will not help to open schools.  We must ensure that teachers, school staff, and parents are engaged in the solutions that we ultimately choose.
Just as I’m suggesting that we engage our teachers, I suggest also that we recognize the very real mental health considerations of what you may have heard called “pandemic fatigue.”  The engagement of Americans all over the country in slowing the spread of the virus is a strategy I think we should all consider.
Again, we know masks work, but we know that some Americans aren’t sure and may not be as compliant as we’d like.  This is gravely frustrating for local officials.  But rather than punishing or sanctioning, what if we employ a different technique?  What if we recognize the psychological aspects of the fatigue and try to reinforce positive behavior with rewards, rather than solely sanction what we deemed to be bad behavior.
For example, we know that compliance on college campuses has been a challenge, and individuals in this age group are a potential source of spread.  What if colleges implemented a random reward system for mask wearing?  This could be as simple as implementing a small gift card being given out to a student wearing a mask.  This technique, known as “contingency management,” has had great success in the behavioral healthcare treatment communities.  I offer it as a consideration which acknowledges the psychological aspects of our life’s changes.
I want to conclude by saying that the physical effects of coronavirus are very real.  And this virus has brought along with it stress, anxiety, and fear that you may have never felt before.  COVID-19 has brought devastating loss of life to families across the nation.
In addition to those who have lost lives to the infection itself, there are those of you who have what I call “COVID-related deaths” in your family.  These are not deaths by infection, but death by suicide or death by drug overdose during this pandemic.  Please know that we have not forgotten you or your loss: Your loss is great.  And my job is to do all I can to prevent additional families from experiencing that loss.
To the parents and teachers who are afraid and confused, that fear and anxiety is real and it’s stressful.  To the people who are without a job and unsure of your next steps, your stress is real too.  The stress of this situation can often feel too great to handle, and we take very seriously the need to ensure that all Americans know that there is help and there is hope.  We are doing all we can to ensure that the mental healthcare system in our nation remains open and ready to serve.
As you struggle with these great stressors, especially during the holiday season, please try to stay connected to loved ones.  Please reach out to friends and family.
And please know that SAMHSA’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available to help at any time at 800-273-8255.  That’s 800-273-TALK.  Your mental health is critically important, and we want to do all we can to protect it.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Good to see all of you.  The doctors have well covered the serious state of the epidemiological evidence that we have, and they’ve talked about the steps that we can and should be taking, but they’ve also talked about the steps that aren’t evidence-based that we should not be taking right now.
We are much better prepared today than we were months ago.  General Sanford talked about our PPE supplies, our ventilator supplies.
The Vice President talked about our expanded testing capacity nationwide reach of over 120 million tests available in the month of November alone, 70 million of them point-of-care tests.
We’ve improved dramatically our quality of care at our hospitals, our ability to treat people who suffer from COVID.
My message to the American people is to hang in there with us.  Take the simple steps that the doctors have talked about today because there is light at the end of the tunnel.  This isn’t forever.
Thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, we have got such a brighter future ahead, and I want to see everyone get there.
President Trump called me in and said, “Alex, all the experts are saying it’s going to be, optimistically, 18 months for a vaccine, over a year for therapeutics.  You know the drug industry; you know drug development.  Could we shorten that?  Is there anything we could do?”  And I said, “Yes, there is.”
And we crafted the greatest biopharmaceutical research development, manufacturing, distribution, mobilization in partnership with the Defense Department.  And with the constant, personal, unwavering support of President Trump, we’re delivering results on that.  And this is thanks to the leadership of people like General Perna running Operation Warp Speed, bringing the complete logistics and operations and procurement power of the Defense Department to the table.  And it’s thanks to people like Dr. Moncef Slaoui, probably the world’s greatest vaccine developer, who’s dedicated his complete life and talents to this work for the American people.  And we’re seeing the results.
They said it couldn’t be done.  But 10 months into this novel pathogen hitting our shores, last week we approved Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody.  We shipped product that very afternoon to patients.  And already, over 60,000 courses of therapy have been delivered.
Regeneron’s combination monoclonal antibody is pending at the FDA right now.  And as we’ve talked about, over the last two weeks we’ve seen just unprecedented historic news about vaccines — two vaccines, each with 95 percent efficacy, rivaling the 98 percent efficacy of our measles vaccine produced in some of the largest vaccine clinical trials ever conducted in history; over 40,000 patients in each of these clinical trials, demonstrating good safety profiles.  This was done in 10 — 10 months.  Ten months.
And now Pfizer’s partner, BioNTech, has announced that, tomorrow, they intend to file for emergency use authorization at the FDA.  We would expect to see Moderna filing soon also.
We also have this comprehensive distribution plan that General Perna walked through that builds on the public-private partnership between the United States and these incredible private sector partners with a goal to make the distribution of this vaccine as convenient to you as the flu vaccine is, and working in partnership with our states because the states know the situation on the ground.  And we work to support them.
And we will ship millions of doses of vaccine within 24 hours of FDA approval.
So my message is: Hope and help are on the way.  Operation Warp Speed is already delivering, and it’s going to keep delivering in the days and weeks ahead.
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well said, Alex.
Let me say, my hope is that Americans looking on and all of you responsible for sharing the news know that this team, working in cooperation with our states and with the cooperation of the American people, has made great progress.  And we’re getting there.  We’re getting there, America.
And as I said at the outset, let me say I hope it’s more in evidence as you hear from this team about the abundance of supplies that are available today for our hospitals, our ability to track what’s happening at your local hospital to make sure it has the PPE and the equipment and supplies to provide the healthcare that your family may need.
I hope — I hope, as you heard about the extraordinary distribution plans of Operation Warp Speed and the confidence that Dr. Fauci expressed today — and the news that one of those research companies is going to submit an emergency use authorization tomorrow on the very first vaccine — that we are literally — literally, we could well be just a matter of a few short weeks away from a vaccine being available across this country for the most vulnerable among us and for those that are caring for them in our hospitals and our clinics.
I hope everything you’ve heard today gives evidence of what I said at the start: that America has never been more prepared to combat this virus.
But let me be clear as I close: We all have a role to play in the days ahead.  And you heard this team say, as we — as we see that finish line, as we see light at the end of the tunnel, as President Trump often says and you should see evidence here: that we are rounding the corner to that day that we have a vaccine for the American people.
We do want to encourage every American to continue to do your part.  Wash your hands.  Practice social distancing.  Wear a mask when social distancing isn’t possible.  Do your part to put the health of your family, the health of your neighbors, the health of the people in your community first.
We are all in this together.  And as I’ve said many times from this podium over many, many months, I know that with the cooperation of the American people; with our incredible doctors and nurses and first responders; with the extraordinary partnership of federal and state and local health officials; and with God’s help, we will get through this, and we will get through this together.
Thank you all.

MS. MCENANY:  Well, good morning, everyone.  Three years ago today, 58 people lost their lives and hundreds more were wounded in the horrific Las Vegas music festival shooting.  That was three years ago today.  On behalf of the President and his administration, our hearts continue to break for the victims and their families.  They are in our prayers today.
Fulfilling his Article 2, Section 2 obligation and following well-established precedent, President Trump nominated an eminently qualified candidate for the Supreme Court: Judge Amy Coney Barrett.
Judge Barrett is extremely well qualified: She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School, where she received the Hoynes Prize for achieving the best record in scholarship, and she also is a Rhodes Scholar.
As Notre Dame Law Professor Carter Snead said, “There’s just consensus: Amy Barrett is the best student, the smartest and most talented person to ever come through the University of Notre Dame Law School.”
In addition to being a gifted student, Judge Barrett clerked for the D.C. — for D.C. Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman and the “Lion of the Court,” Justice Antonin Scalia.
In 2017, Judge Barrett was confirmed in a bipartisan vote to serve on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  In support of her 2017 nomination, colleagues described Judge Barrett as, quote, “a model of the fair, impartial, and sympathetic judge.”
Judge Barrett is not only a qualified jurist but a woman of character.  Judge Barrett is the devoted working mom of seven children, including two adopted children from Haiti and one child born with special needs.  Judge Barrett is full of compassion and empathy, and she understands the needs of our nation’s most vulnerable.
Judge Barrett would become the first-ever mother of school-aged children to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.  If confirmed, Judge Barrett would be the only Republican-appointed woman on the Court and the fifth woman in the Court’s history.
Her qualifications are many.  Her character is unquestionable.  Her devotion to the Constitution and interpreting the law as written is steadfast.  Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the right choice to serve on the Supreme Court.
And with that, I will take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-100120/

5:32 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Does anybody know these two gentlemen in the room?  If you don’t, let us know.  You shouldn’t be here if you don’t.  It’s great to have you guys.
       Yesterday, I was very proud to nominate Judge Amy Coney
Barrett to the United States Supreme Court.  She is one of our nation’s most brilliant legal minds, and I think she’ll do very well.  We’re moving along very quickly.  Tremendous unity in the Republican Party.  It’s the consequence of winning elections, which we did very substantially, both in the Senate and obviously in the White House.  And I think we’re going to take back the House; I believe that very strongly.  Kevin is doing a fantastic job.  And I really believe we’re going to take back the House, and we’re all working very hard on that.
     We have noticed some comments made in the media about my incredibly qualified nominee, Amy.  The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values.  She’s Catholic.  That covers a lot of people.  That’s a very disgraceful thing to say. 
     Some of the comedians — I don’t think they’re comedians because comedians are supposed to be funny; they’re not funny, like, at all.  They’re nasty.  They’re mean.  And they think they’re funny.  And someday — hopefully, it’s in five years — but someday, when I’m not here, they’re going to be off television because their ratings, which aren’t very good anyway, but their ratings are going to go down like you’ve never seen before.  That includes a lot of others also. 
     In fact, I’m sort of waiting for the New York Times and the Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSDNC — I’m waiting for them to endorse me, because if they don’t, they’re going to drop with a thud like — you know, it was supposed to have happened long ago, and then we won a race, and it was a great — it was a great victory. 
     And our — I think we’ve never had a more energized base.  I don’t think so.  Nobody has ever seen anything like it.  The rallies that we’re having are incredible; we call them “protests.”  They’re friendly protests.  We don’t want to call them “rallies,” but the friendly protest rallies are — have been incredible.  People — I don’t think anybody has ever seen anything like it.  And this is still long before an election.  This isn’t like the evening before.  These are long before an election.
     The — the incredible crowd we had in Pennsylvania and Virginia — in every state, no matter where — in North Carolina, Florida — no matter where we go, we’re having crowds like nobody — I don’t think anybody has ever gotten before ever.  Not even close.
     There’s a level of enthusiasm — in Iowa today, with the tractors — thousands of tractors.  In different states, the boats.  You know, thousands and thousands of boats.  Boaters for Trump, Tractors for Trump, Farmers for Trump — it’s really been very nice to see the level of enthusiasm.
     I thought, though — on the religious situation with Amy, I thought we settled this 60 years ago with the election of John F. Kennedy.  But seriously, they’re going after her Catholicism.  I will stand with her, fight with her, and we will make sure that these attacks stop because they really — it’s unprecedented.  They’re basically fighting a major religion in our country.  This is incredible.  Fighting any religion and fighting Catholicism is just incredible that they can be doing it.  Are you Catholic, Rudy? 
     Twenty-nine Supreme Court vacancies have occurred during an election year or before an inauguration.  In every single instance, going back to George Washington, the President has performed his constitutional duty and nominated a justice.  And in almost every one of these cases over the past 230 years where the President and the Senate were the same party, the justice — as you know, that justice was confirmed.
     This is about two centuries — more than two centuries of precedent.  And I think it’ll continue.  I think we’re going to have — I think it’s going to go quickly, actually.  And I think —
     And again, I don’t know if I’ve ever seen the Republican Party more unified.  I think it was probably even more unified with the impeachment hoax, actually.  When they did the impeachment hoax, I think that was — which really turned out to be a hoax, because now you look at what’s happening with the FBI and Justice Department; if you look at all of those text messages, emails that were sent, it — we have been totally proven right.  They spied on our campaign, and everybody knew it.  Biden knew it; Obama knew it.  Everybody knew it.  And the lamestream media just, you know, doesn’t want to pick it up, although some have.  I will say, Catherine Herridge at CBS has done a fantastic job on it.  We appreciate that.
     But this is a major scandal.  This is a scandal, the likes of which nobody has ever seen.  This is actually the biggest political scandal in the history of our country.  And with the exception of a few, I mean, they just don’t want to write about it.  You should read about that, Kelly, you know.  You should write about it.  You should write about it.  You should do something on CNN about it, because it’s the biggest single scandal of our time; certainly the biggest political scandal, perhaps, in history.
     They — they spied on our campaign, and then they tried for a coup.  That didn’t work out too well.  And it turned out that, if you read the — you read the texts that came out over the last three days, it turned out that they were really — it was reversed; it was the DNC and the Democrats that were using Russia.  And related or unrelated, Hunter Biden got three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow.  Why did he get three and a half million dollars?  And then he got millions more than we thought from Ukraine, and he got millions more than we heard about from China.  Hunter Biden — “Where’s Hunter?”
     So these are all questions that are very, very big on the Internet.  The biggest thing going on the Internet is exactly this.  And we’re going to have to see how that all turns out, but it turned out that we were right.  So we went through two and a half years of ruining people’s lives, like General Flynn and many others — ruining their lives.  And it turned out to be just the opposite.  It was the Democrats that were dealing with Russia and other things.
     So hopefully, our Attorney General and others working on this very, very hard, very diligently, will — it’ll lead to something that will be very important for our nation.  I think it’s very important for our nation.  It’s one of the most important things.
     A central issue of the 2018 midterm elections was the Kavanaugh confirmation.  And American voters punished the Democrats in the Senate.  You so what happened; we picked up two seats.  Again, something that hasn’t been reported on very much.  But we picked up two seats for their treatment of Justice Kavanaugh and expanded our Senate majority to confirm Supreme Court justices, which was great.
     And now Democrats are really brazenly attacking Judge Barrett for, again, her faith, mostly, is what I’m hearing — for her Catholic faith.  And whether it’s C or anybody else, I think they ought to treat religion with much more respect.  I think it’s a disgrace that they can do it. 
     Biden and the Democrats are desperate to distract from the real issues, which is that their party has been taken over by socialists, extremists, and probably communists.  I think it’s beyond socialism; I think it’s a step beyond, and could be many steps beyond, if you take a look.
     And if they win, they will nominate justices who will destroy the American way of life, the American Dream.  They will destroy the American Dream.  They’ll destroy America.  They’ll destroy the United States of America.  Your private right to own a firearm will be totally eliminated, your guns will be confiscated, your ability to live by your religious faith will be devastated.  They’ll abolish America’s borders and give government healthcare to illegal aliens, which will destroy our healthcare system because so many people will pour into our country.  That’s a tremendous incentive.
     On voter fraud, as you know, hopefully there won’t be a very big movement because hopefully we’re going to be able to win.  I think we have the massive movement.  I think we’re going to have a tremendous, tremendous victory.  There won’t be a transition because I can’t imagine we call a transition if we win.  You know, they talk about, “Will there be a friendly transition?”  Of course, there will, but we have a big problem, and you see it every day; you see it happening every day with ballots.
     We are gravely concerned about the Democrat assault on election integrity.  In Brooklyn, 25 percent of mail-in ballots were ruled invalid in June’s Democrat primary.  You saw that. In a special election in New Jersey, 20 percent of the ballots were thrown out, and four people are now being prosecuted for fraud.  This is all in the mail-ballots. 
     Thirty-five thousand mail-in ballots were rejected in Florida’s primary, and one hundred thousand were rejected in California, and that’s just the beginning.
     A week after Pennsylvania’s primary, half of the counties were still counting ballots, and you’ll be counting them here because this is a much bigger version of all of that.  Just last week, a number of discarded military ballots were discovered in Pennsylvania.  All of the recovered ballots — these were ballots that were thrown out — had been cast for a person named Donald J. Trump.
     In Wisconsin, three trays of mail containing absentee ballots were found in a ditch; they were thrown in a ditch.  Three trays.  That’s a lot.
     In North Carolina, voters are reporting receiving two ballots in the mail.  Many — many voters.  I hear it’s thousands, but they’re getting two ballots.  I wonder if those are Democrat areas, because the word is they are.
     In Iowa caucus’s last winter, you know what happened there.  You all reported on it, I think, very well.  Right?  Do you remember that one?  It was not good, right?  But in Iowa, they still don’t really know who the winner was.  I think they called somebody eventually, but it was many, many weeks later.  But they really have no idea, and that’s being — continues to be — and that’s little; that’s just a small — it continues to be litigated in Iowa.  They can’t run a simple caucus, yet now they’re trying to radically write election laws nationwide, just weeks before the presidential election.
     I heard in New York today that Governor Cuomo wants to try and simplify the ballots because he thinks they’re too complicated.  And all of that, I agree with him.  I think that’s good.  But you don’t do that now.  The ballots are starting to come in.  And, you know, you can’t do it now.  It’s too late.
     Joe Biden and the Democrat extremists oppose all of these efforts to ensure election integrity.  They oppose voter ID.  Think of it: Voter ID.  They want a picture.  They have a picture for almost everything nowadays, but they don’t want a picture.  You had a picture to get into the Democrat National Convention.  You had a card with your picture on it.  Did you know that, fellas?  You have a — to get into the Democratic National Convention, you have a card and your picture is on it, but they don’t want it for voting, which is our very sacred right.
     They want — we want proof of citizenship, a Social Security number requirement.  They don’t want any of this to happen.  And they want no signature verification.  They don’t want to have a verified signature.
     So they want none of the safety valves that you would have.  Think of it: They opposed voter ID.  They approve proof of — they oppose proof of citizenship.  They oppose a Social Security number and requirements for Social Security numbers as a safety valve.  And they oppose even simple signature verifications.  They don’t want to have signature verification.
     They want to require all states to do mail-in balloting, right?  I call it “unsolicited.”  Some people call it “universal.”  I think “universal” doesn’t make sense because nobody understands why universal.  So it’s “unsolicited.”  They want unsolicited mail-in ballots.  In other words, you send these ballots to whoever you can think of.
     We had a case, I guess in New Jersey, you were reading to me, where somebody was sent two ballots, and they had slightly — one was — had a hyphen in it, the name, and the other one had a “K.”  And they got two names.  So I wonder if that person was a Democrat.  Probably was.
     And mailing of millions of ballots to people who never asked for them.  So millions of people are going to be getting ballots who never asked for the ballots.  They don’t want the ballots, or maybe they want them; maybe they don’t.  Nobody knows, really.  This is really a recipe for chaos.  And when you look at what happened in Iowa — and again, that was run by very smart people.  It was a very limited election.  It was very small numbers we’re talking about.  We’re talking about doing that for the entire nation.
     And you can forget about November 3rd, because you’re going to be counting these things forever.  And it’s very dangerous for our country. 
     So, certainly, a transition — we all believe in transition.  We believe not only in transition, but a very friendly.  But when the ballots and when the system is rigged, which it is; obviously it is.  And the only one that knows that better than me are the Democrats.  And they go into closed rooms and they must laugh like hell at what’s going on, because these ballots are being found.  And this is the beginning.  I talk about it now at the rallies.  All these people are watching.  Eyes and ears.  Thousands and thousands.  Tens of thousands.
     But there’s no justification for these extreme changes to the election law.  And if you can go to the grocery store, you can have an ID with your picture on it to vote.  It’s so important.  I mean, it’s just so important.
     So a lot of things are going on.  Very importantly, though — I think very, very importantly is when you — when you do your reporting, I think you ought to report on the FBI scandal because it’s one of the great scandals in the history of our country.  And I think people want to hear about it.  If you look at the Internet, you’ll see how people want to hear about it.  And they will know about it, and it just makes the media look so bad.  And there’s so much reporting — I could go into it right now, but I’m not going to do that. 
     But it would be a tremendous thing for the mainstream medium — media to really start reporting.  I think your ratings we go through the roof; I really do — because people really are tired of this fake stuff where you don’t even talk about it.  And the biggest scandal — certainly the biggest political scandal in the history of our country, by far; bigger than Watergate.  Much bigger than Watergate.  And they try and avoid it as much as possible.  It’s getting very hard to avoid.
     So we’ll take a couple of questions, and you may have a question for these two very wonderful people, brilliant people, from the standpoint of politics, I would say, and law.  And if you have anything for Kayleigh, we’d love to do that.
     Go ahead, please.  Phil?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-september-27-2020/

1:23 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  The radicals are in control of the Democrat Party.  Make no mistake, Democrat radicals want to shatter norms and disregard precedent for the sake of the very norms and precedent they claim must be safeguarded.
They’ve proposed court packing — an egregious idea.  They’ve entertained impeachment as punishment for the President exercising his lawful Article Two, Section Two authority to appoint — nominate, rather, a justice to the Supreme Court.  They’ve advocated for the abolition of the Electoral College.  These are all the tactics that they’re using to sow chaos and discord.  Likewise, they’re endorsing a mass mail-out ballot system that will likely lead to the kind of weeklong delay New York witnessed in its recent primary.
Far-left radicals resort to tactics like this to push their extreme agenda because they cannot win on the merits; they cannot succeed based on the will of the American people.  This administration will continue to call out these tactics, while Democrats should end their petty politics and get to work.

6:16 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today, Johnson & Johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials.  This is record time.  This is the fourth vaccine candidate in the United States to reach the final stage of trial.  So we have four candidates already at a very late date.  “Late” being a very positive word, in this case.
Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by September.  But due to our support under Operation Warp Speed, and to some of the incredible scientists involved, they’ve reached phase three trials by September — far ahead of schedule.  We encourage Americans to enroll in the vaccine trial.  It’s not only interesting; it’ll be a terrific thing for our country.  We encourage everybody to enroll, as many people as we can.
Today, my administration announced that we are awarding $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 states to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents, and we want to do that the instant it is approved — not the following day, but the following moment.  And so we’re going to be doing that, and we’ll be distributing, getting it ready, because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out.
Through Operation Warp Speed, we also continue to accelerate lifesaving therapies.  We’re seeing promising results that our monoclonal antibody treatments — which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly — we’re finding can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70 percent.
By cutting the red tape and unleashing America’s medical genius, we’ve reduced the fatality rate 85 percent since April.  For individuals under 50, they’ve — they have a 99.98 percent rate of survival from the China virus.  That’s a number that’s been really increasing substantially with time.
As children go back to school, we’re encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread.  Brown University conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 states and found that only 0.076 percent of students had confirmed cases of the virus — that’s a tiny percentage — and 0.15 percent of teachers had confirmed cases.
Patients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6 percent of all emergency room visits — the lowest since the pandemic began.  1.6 percent emergency room visits.
As far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned, we provided over $21 billion to our nursing homes, and we are really focused on the nursing homes.  Everybody, including our governors — we have governors who are working very closely with the task force and with the Vice President and everybody involved.  We’ve sent rapid-testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes in the country.
This week, we’re sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure they can test staff regularly.  And the staff now is being tested on a very, very powerful and on a regular basis, but very strongly at the finest level, the highest level, and the best tests.
We’re encouraged that the number of Americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50 percent compared to last year.  It’s substantially up.  The flu, when it’s mixed with COVID, or China virus, is going to be very interesting to see what happens.  But that can drive numbers.  And we just don’t know what that will be yet, but you’ll have flu numbers and you’ll have some COVID numbers.
I think we’re rounding the turn very much.  You see what’s happening in Europe, however.  They have a very big spike.  Countries that we thought were doing well aren’t doing well.  They had some very big spikes.  Very — a very big surge.
Months ago, we increased our nation’s procurement of the flu vaccine by 66 percent, and we ask Americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible.  It’s possible, I would imagine, Scott, that the flu can get mixed up with the virus, and people can think it’s the virus when actually it’s another flu season coming on.  I don’t know, it’s — I hope they can keep them separate.  Can they keep them separate?
DR. ATLAS:  We hope so.
THE PRESIDENT:  Huh?  I doubt they will.  It’s going to be a very interesting time.
But we have a flu season coming up.  We’ve had some flu seasons, which are really massive over the years — over many years.  And we have some that are much less so.  But it’s still significant, so I hope they can separate them, because it’s — it’s pretty close.
In the past four months, we’ve created 10.6 million jobs.  We cut unemployment rate nearly in half.  The unemployment rate is cut nearly in half.  Larry Kudlow is here.  He’ll be discussing that in a little while.  Retail sales are up 121 percent; that’s far above what we thought.  Manufacturing is up 61 percent; that’s above — also above our schedule, and our schedule is a heavy schedule.  Automobile production is up six-fold.  Homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level in history.  That’s an amazing statement, Larry: the highest level in history.  That means people are thinking good thoughts.
Home sales are at the highest level in nearly 15 years.  Small-business optimism is higher than any time under the last administration, substantially higher.  Small-business optimism — higher than at any time over the last — more than the last administration.
Today, I was proud to award nine companies and organizations with the first-ever Pledge to America’s Workers Presidential Award.  This award recognizes outstanding training programs that are giving Americans the skills to hone a trade and earn a great living.  They’re great people.  Over fi- — 400 companies have competed and committed to 16 million training opportunities for the American worker, and it’s really been amazing.
We’ve created the fastest economic recovery in American history.  You are witnessing it.  You are a part of it.
Our approach is pro-science.  Biden’s approach is anti-science.  If you look, it’s — I don’t think they know what their approach is, although a lot of it’s copied from what we’ve done.
Biden opposed the China travel ban and the Europe travel ban.  And the strategy that they have was just never-ending lockdowns.  We’re not locking down.  We’re actually growing at a rate that we’ve never experienced before.  But they’re talking about — if you have a question, just lock it down.  We’re not doing that, and you can’t do that.
Our plan will crush the virus.  And actually, Biden’s plan will crush America, if you think about it.  You can’t lock down.  Again, we’re growing at levels that nobody has ever seen before.  Our plan is unleashing a rapid recovery.  Our opponent’s plan would hurt America very badly.  It would send us into a depression.
And with all of that being said, we are going to be having a very exciting Saturday at five o’clock in the Rose Garden, where I’ll be putting forth my nominee for Supreme Court Justice.  And I think it will be a great nominee, a brilliant nominee.  As you know, it’s a woman.  We brought it down to five women.  It’s time for a woman to — to be chosen, with everything that’s happened and with Justice Ginsburg’s passing.
We are going to go sometime tomorrow morning, as I understand it, to pay our respects.  And we’ll be over there, and I guess they probably put that announcement out.  But that’ll be done tomorrow morning.  The Vice President was there today.
And so, if you have any questions, we’ll take a few questions.  Yeah.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-092420/

1:23 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have officially shown their blatant disregard for the United States Constitution.  Apparently, it is now a high crime and misdemeanor worthy of impeachment for a lawfully elected President of the United States to exercise his constitutional duty.
Article Two, Section Two of the Constitu- — of the Constitution clearly states that the President, quote, “shall nominate,” end quote, justices of the Supreme Court when a vacancy occurs.  No matter the time, no matter the politics of the day, the President is the President.  There is nothing in the Constitution that says the President stops being the President in an election year.
The President has already appointed two strong, conservative justices to the Supreme Court — justices who will interpret the Constitution as written.  Now he will nominate a third.
As Senator Ted Cruz reminds us, “We’re one vote away from seeing our religious liberty votes [rights] stripped away, from our free speech stripped away, from our Second Amendment [being] stripped away.”  Just one vote.  Contrast the President’s solemn constitutional duty with Democrats’ “search and destroy” politics.
Nancy Pelosi has vowed to attack the President with, quote, “arrows.”  Speaker Pelosi will not rule out impeaching this President for doing his job for fulfill- — for fulfilling his constitutional obligation.
AOC said that impeachment is an option, quote, “on the table,” while Chuck Schumer stood by, nodding approvingly.
The plan of House Democrats is so rabidly radical that even Democrat Senator Tim Kaine has rebuked the idea, calling the idea of using impeachment to delay a Supreme Court vote, quote, “foolish.”
Some Democrats already have a backup plan if they don’t get their way on this nomination.  Congressman Joe Kennedy said, “If he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021.  It’s that simple.”
Senator Ed Markey went further.  “No Supreme Court vacancies filled in an election year,” he said.  “If he violates it, when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.”
Senator, the President is elected to a four-year term.  You cannot unilaterally reduce it to three years.  The President is the President.
Democrats cannot win their argument on the merits.  They cannot win on precedent.  So they must search and destroy.
Don Lemon said the quiet — the quiet part out loud last night.  He said this: “We’re going to have to blow up the entire system” if the President does his job as outlined in the Constitution.
That’s the difference between Republicans and Democrats.  We fight to protect the system.  We fight to protect the Constitution when Democrats say outright, “We are going to blow up the entire system because we do not get our way.”
This President will proceed undaunted by Democrat threats.  President Trump will fulfill his duty.  President Trump will appoint the next Supreme Court justice.  President Trump will protect religious liberty.  President Trump will protect our freedom of speech.  President Trump will protect our Second Amendment.
Under this President, our rights will be upheld, our Constitution safeguarded, and this President will fill that seat.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room


3:09 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  So a lot of work has been going on with respect to the vaccines — very successful work, I might add.  We have three great, great companies doing somewhat different variations, but they’re all looking very good.
From the beginning of the China virus, all nations have understood that our top priority must be to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible to end the pandemic and get life back to normal.  The successful vaccine will not only save millions of lives, it will put an end to the restrictions and some of the things that go on and have to go on in the meantime.
Today, I want to discuss the historic progress we’re making to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time.  And there’s never been anything like this ever.  In our history, there’s never been any — in history, period — world history.
Since January, America’s brilliant doctors and scientists have been working around the clock.  These are the best medical minds in the world, by far.  And the vaccines are going through the gold standard of clinical trials, and very heavy emphasis placed on safety.  Three vaccines are already in the final stage.
Joe Biden’s anti-vaccine theories are putting a lot of lives at risk.  And they’re only doing it for political reasons; it’s very foolish.  It’s part of their war to try and discredit the vaccine, now that they know that we essentially have it.  We’ll be announcing it fairly soon.
As part of Operation Warp Speed, my administration is manufacturing all of the most promising vaccines in advance.  And actually, it’ll be fairly long in advance.  As soon as a vaccine is approved, the administration will deliver it to the American people immediately.  Distribution will begin within 24 hours after notice.
And the general — I think those are the words specifically you wanted us to use?
GENERAL PERNA:  Yes, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Within 24 hours, you’re all set to go.  And massive amounts will be delivered through our great military.  And the general is one of our best and he is ready to go.
We’ll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and likely much more than that.  Hundreds of millions of doses will be available every month.  And we expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April.
And, again, I’ll say that even at that later stage, the delivery will go — as fast as it comes, they can deliver.  They’re very good.  Best — I think probably the best in the world.
The estimates I’m providing today are based on the manufacturing that’s in process, and that’s in process immediately, right now.  We’ve already exceeded our ambitious goals.
Under the Defense Production Act, contracts that we’ve secured — we may even get far above these numbers.  And numbers that I’m telling you today, I think we’ll exceed them very, very substantially.  And I think that also includes distribution.  I think distribution will go even quicker than most people think.
I’m relying on our military.  Everything I’ve done with our military, it’s worked out very well.
In a short time, we’ll have a safe and effective vaccine, and we’ll defeat the virus.  Interestingly, as I was saying that go “very well,” just like what we did with our military with respect to ISIS went very well — long ahead of schedule.  They have been incredible in working with me.
Let’s go to Puerto Rico, because Puerto Rico has been hit very, very hard by a lot of different storms, and they’re great people.  It’s a great place.  I know it well.  Great place.
Today, my administration is making the largest emergency relief award in history to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and educational system.  We’re awarding $13 billion to permanently repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines that should have been done many years ago.
This was beyond even the storms.  This was just age and a lot of the salt.  The salt from that ocean is a killer for electrical stations and power generation systems.
But on top of the salt, you had these massive storms or hurricanes come in.  And Maria, in particular, was a disaster.
But for many years, they’ve been trying to get this done, and they haven’t had the political willpower in Washington to get it done.  So we’re going to get it done for them.
We’re also going to be bringing back very, very major amounts of medical work.  You know, where you have pharmace- — pharmaceutical manufacturing at levels that few places had, and a lot of it has left Puerto Rico.  And we’re going to bring that back, especially now, since our emphasis is going to be making our product.  So we’re going to bring pharmaceutical manufacturing back to Puerto Rico.  A lot of it left over the years, over a long period of time.  It’s been leaving and going to China and other places.  So we’re bringing all of that back.
This was done in previous administrations.  I’d like to just point out we’ve done more for Puerto Rico than anybody.  And this is just an example of it, but we’ve done more for Puerto Rico, by far, than anybody.
We’ll also be launching a major effort to repair and renovate the schools across the island.  Following Hurricane Maria, my administration immediately deployed the full power of the federal government to bring the electric grid back online so they could at least temporarily — and it certainly wasn’t a permanent fix; it was ripped to shreds.  But a lot of that was ripped to shreds long before even the storm came in.  For many, many years, they’ve been trying to do it.  But we wanted to restore water supplies.  And we did make emergency repairs to critical infrastructure, which we took care of, and saved countless lives, which we did.
FEMA’s response in Puerto Rico included the longest sustained air mission, supplying food and water, in American history.  We supplied it for long after the hurricane was gone.  The largest disaster commodity distribution mission in U.S. history and the largest sea bridge operation in federal disaster aid in U.S. history.
My administration has also pre-positioned vast quantities of relief supplies for the future disasters.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rico is in — in the way of a lot of different storms, a lot of hurricanes.  And the island is now stocked with nearly 8 times as much drinking water and 13 times as much food as it had before I took office.  So they’re ready to go if something should happen.
They got brushed by a storm recently, but they’re in a good position.  So we’re going to bring back medical distribution and manufacturing to Puerto Rico, and at a level far greater than it was before.
And it’s been emptied out.  It’s been largely — it largely left the island for many years.  At one point, it was a — it was the talk of the world, and now it’s the talk of the world in a different way.  We’re bringing it back.  So we’re going to be bringing it back from various other parts of the world.  It’s going to Puerto Rico.  And I think that’s going to be very exciting for the people.
And we’re undertaking the largest federal investment in Puerto Rico’s history.  So you have a lot of — I have a lot of friends in Puerto Rico, and I told them about it — asked them about it.  “Conceptually, what do you think?”  And they’re very excited.
I just want to say, by contrast, Biden has devastated the island of Puerto Rico.  He — Joe Biden, what he’s done to Puerto Rico, meaning the past administration, is devastating.
In 1996, Biden voted to eliminate a critical tax provision that had allowed Puerto Rico to become a dominant player in global pharmaceutical manufacturing.  That’s what happened.  When Biden voted to repeal this provision, the pharmaceutical industry was ripped out of Puerto Rico.  All incentive to stay there was taken away, and all of the jobs went to China and other places, but mostly to China.  That’s what happened.  This was done with a vote of Biden.  This was even before the Obama administration.  This was — this was early on.  But so — so sad that that was done.
And then Obama came in and it got worse.  So for the people of Puerto Rico: They were a disaster for you.  And I have to say, in a very nice way, a very respectful way, I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico.  Nobody even close.
But as a result, the island’s economy, under the previously mentioned names, it just absolutely cratered.  Biden’s vote also left the United States at the mercy of foreign suppliers for essential medicines, putting our national security and our health at risk.
We had a tremendous industry potentially going to Puerto Rico, and they just absolutely cut it short with bad votes, and took all the incentive away, and it went to other places –faraway lands.  So they really, in a sense, were voting to destroy Puerto Rico.  And we’re bringing Puerto Rico back, and we’ll have it done fairly quickly.
And the $13 billion is a — that’s tremendous — that’s a tremendous amount of money, but it’s a very important amount.  And I think you’re going to see something terrific.  And it’s very exciting.  To me, what — the most exciting is bringing the whole pharmaceutical industry back.
We’ve spoken to various companies and they’re willing to go there.  They want to have a little bit of help, but they’re willing to go to Puerto Rico.  And Puerto Rico is going to be very exciting, what’s going to happen.  They were on the verge of doing it, and they took away all the incentives.  I don’t know how that was allowed to happen, but they allowed it to happen.  That was very, very bad for Puerto Rico and the people of Puerto Rico.  That was done by Democrats, and a Republican is bringing it back.
So, with that, we can take a few questions.  And we are, again, very advanced on the vaccine.  We think that sometime in the very near future, we’ll have it.  We’re, I would say — I think I can say — years ahead of schedule, what it would be if it were an administration other than this one.  It would have been — you would have been years before you ever had anything approved by the FDA.
John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-september-18-2020/

5:17 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Hurricane Sally made landfall, as you know, in Alabama and Florida last night as a Category 2 hurricane, and has caused 35 inches of rainfall in some places.  That’s a lot.
     We have hundreds of FEMA, Coast Guard; we have the National Guard personnel on the ground assisting response to the efforts.  And Alabama is in great shape, and every place that we are working with the state governments — really in great shape.  We are working very hard on that.
     But it looks like it’s going to be mostly safe, but just follow the instructions of all of your local and federal people there.  We have the best people that you can have.  So I want to thank everybody.  I want to thank everybody for working so hard in Florida.  And they’re very good at this.  The people in Florida handle it; they know how to handle it.  And the people working there know how to handle it.
     The governors have all been spoken to, and it’s a combination of real spirit.  And they have a tremendous esprit de corps.  They have a tremendous sense of working on hurricanes; they’ve gotten very good at it.  And we’ve certainly had plenty, even since I’ve been here.  We’ve had a lot of them.  So that’s in good shape — Hurricane Sally.
     We’re going to talk about Big 10 football, but that’s a terrific thing.  We’ll discuss that at the end.  I just want to go into the vaccine distribution.
     Today, my administration released our detailed national vaccine distribution plan, and that includes a plan to ensure that we swiftly deliver the vaccine directly to America’s senior citizens in nursing homes.  And it’s all set.  We have our military lined up.  Everybody is lined up.  And we think that’s going to go very nicely.  We’re very close to that vaccine, as you know, and I think closer than most people want to say, or certainly closer than most people understand.
     To get the vaccine into the hands of American people, we’re fully mobilizing the awesome power of American industry and also our military.  This is the largest, fastest, and most advanced vaccine distribution effort in American history, by far.  I was reading where Biden was saying that, oh, he’s going to have a plan.  They did so bad on swine flu, you wouldn’t even believe it.  Take a look at their record on swine flu.  In fact, the person that headed it up said it was a total disaster.
     We’re on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner.  We think we can start sometime in October.  So as soon as it is announced, we’ll be able to start.  That’ll be from mid-October on.  It may be a little bit later than that, but we’ll be all set.
     So as soon as it’s given the go-ahead — they’re doing trials, as you know — and as soon as it’s given the go-ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus. 
     We’ve manufactured all of the necessary supplies so that as soon as the FDA approves the vaccine — and, as you know, we’re very close to that — we’ll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020 and a large number much sooner than that.
     I’m calling on Biden to stop promoting his anti-vaccine theories because all they’re doing is hurting the importance of what we’re doing.  And I know that if they were in this position, they’d be saying how wonderful it is.  They’re recklessly endangering lives.  You can’t do that.
     And again, this is really a case that they’re only talking — just started talking a little bit negatively, and that’s only because they know we have it, or we will soon have it.  And the answer to that is very soon.
     The case updates — it’s very interesting to see what’s happening because the test positivity rate is down among all age groups and has fallen below 5 percent for the first time since this whole nightmare of the China virus began.  So it’s fallen below 5 percent.
     The number of hospitalized patients has decreased by 43 percent from mid-July — 43 percent.  Nationally, people sick with the China virus now make up only 1.5 percent of all emergency room visits.  So we’re down to the lowest number we’ve had.  1.5 percent of emergency room visits is for the China virus.
     And thanks to our lifesaving therapies and treatments — I think this is the best of all, in terms of our great percentages and all the progress we’ve made — the fatality rate has fallen 85 percent since April — 85 percent — fatality rate.
     If you look at what we’ve done and all of the lives that we’ve saved — and I’m going to ask that a graph be put up, and now it’s up.  This was right at the beginning.  This was our prediction that if we do a really good job, we’ll be at about a hundred and — 100,000 to 240,000 deaths.  And we’re below that substantially, and we’ll see what comes out.  But that would be if we did the good job.  If the not-so-good job was done, you’d be between 1.5 million — I remember these numbers so well — and 2.2 million.  That’s quite a difference.
     So we’re down in this territory.  And that’s despite the fact that the blue states had tremendous death rates.  If you take the blue states out, we’re at a level that I don’t think anybody in the world would be at.  We’re really at a very low level.  But some of the states, they were blue states and blue-state-managed. 
     And, by the way, we’d recommend they open up their states.  I think it’s very important that they open up their states, because if you look at certain of them — North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others — we have to get those states open.  It’s hurting people.  It’s hurting people far more than the disease itself.
     So we would recommend that you open them; let your people have freedom.  And it’s unfair to your people to keep them closed at this stage.  We know the vaccine — we know the vaccines are coming, but we know the problem; we understand who the vulnerable are, which is primarily people with medical problems, but in particular, people with medical problems that are older.  So open up your states.
     To facilitate routine testing of the nursing home residents and staff, we’ve delivered rapid testing devices to all 1,000 or — excuse me, 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide.  So you have 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide, and they are being facilitated in terms of testing and testing — testing apparatus.  Everything is there.
     We also have new tests coming, and we have one in particular that I think I showed last night, which is literally two pieces of very fine cardboard.  It’s actually a lot of delicate things going on inside that cardboard, but it’s an incredible test.  It’s very quick, it’s very accurate, and moves along rapidly.  We bought millions of those tests, and they’re going to be distributed rapidly.
     So the testing process, where — there’s nobody in the world that has a testing process like ours.  In addition to being a number one — number two, which is India, is close to 50 million tests behind us, I believe, Scott.  Fifty million.  They have 1.5 billion people.
     Tomorrow, Vice President Pence will be announcing the findings of the Nursing Home Commission to continue protecting our most vulnerable, which is our senior citizens.  And we’re going to take good care of them.
     I want to congratulate Big 10 football.  It’s — it’s back.  And I want to, in particular — I’ve been dealing with him — thank Commissioner Kevin Warren for the great job he did.  We’ve been working with him for a while.  There was a rumor being spread that I didn’t want football back, and it was just the opposite.  That was another disinformation rumor put out by the Biden campaign.  And it was just the opposite.  But it really spurred me into action.
     I called the commissioner a couple of weeks ago, and we started really putting a lot of pressure on, frankly, because there was no reason for it not to come back.  And Kevin went in and worked very hard.  I want to thank the players, the coaches for working along.  And they wanted it very badly — the players and coaches, in particular; the parents also.  And Big 10 football just announced, as you know, that their schedule — they announced a schedule, and it’s going to be great; important to have.
     I want to recommend that the Pac-12 also get going, because there’s no reason why Pac-12 shouldn’t be playing now.  And perhaps they’ll start with — at least partially — I had recommended today to Kevin and others that maybe you want to start off with 25 percent of the stadium or you maybe want to start off with empty.  I don’t know.  If it’s — I think they could have fans go, frankly.  But they want to be careful, they want to be safe, and they will be safe.  They’ve got a very good testing process for the players, coaches, families, et cetera.
     And so I just want to congratulate Big 10.  It’s going to be great.  We’re going to love watching that.  And again, I want to recommend Pac-12 — you’re the only one now.  Open up.  Open up, Pac-12.  Get going.  Said the same thing to Big 10 and they did, and now I’m saying it to Pac-12.  You have time.  You really have time right now.  Get going.
     I want to thank all of those wonderful coaches — some of whom I spoke with.  And we went through a process over the last couple of weeks.  And I want to thank Congressman Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who, as you know, was a great football player.  Some people know that; I know that.  But Anthony was a great player, great receiver.  Went to the NFL. 
     Also, I want to thank Tim Pataki of my staff.  He worked very hard on this.  And he was up day and night, working with Kevin and everybody else.  So I want to thank Tim Pataki.  Great job. 
     So Big 10 is back, and it’s going to have hopefully a great season. 
     The Census recently found that in the second quarter of 2020, Hispanic Americans’ homeownership reached a record all-time high.  That’s all-time in the history of our country.  Yesterday, the census reported that median income for Americans increased by an unprecedented $4,400 last year to a record of $68,700. 
     In 2019, income inequality fell for the second straight year.  The income gap widened under the Obama-Biden administration, and it widened fairly substantially, and it narrowed under the Trump administration.  So there’s a little fact that you didn’t know.  So it narrowed under us, and it widened under Obama.
     Income grew more, last year alone, than over the entire eight years of Obama-Biden.  And that’s a big statement, but that’s the way it is.
     In 2019, 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty.  That’s the largest poverty reduction under any President in history: 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. 
     The Hispanic American poverty rate reached the lowest level ever — history of our country.  Hispanic American poverty rate — lowest level ever. 
     I created the greatest and fairest economy in history.  The biggest gains went to lower-income Americans, as they measure that kind of thing. 
     We will be back to full strength very soon.  We’re going to have a fantastic year next year.  It’s looking like that.  I think you’re going to have an incredible third quarter.  The numbers are looking very, very strong for the third quarter.  We have numbers that we’re going to put out tomorrow — some of the individual things.  Car production, housing production, housing ownership — so many different things are just at levels that nobody thought possible as we round the turn on the pandemic. 
     The anti-police crusade from the Democrats and the radical left — and radical-left Democrats also — has to stop.  The leftwing war on cops puts our officers in danger and our communities at very grave risk.  Can’t do this. 
     Biden described the police as “the enemy.”  They’re not the enemy; they’re the friend.  They’re our friend.  They’re helping us.  And if you go to — I just saw a poll — it just came out or recently came out — where African Americans, by 84 percent, wanted more police.  They wanted safe neighborhoods.
     In Phoenix last night, a federal officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting.  In LA this weekend — everybody saw that — this horrible human being — or whatever you might want to call him — I think “him.”  They’re looking all over.  There trying to find him.  We’re going to find out.  We’re going to get him. 
     But in LA this weekend, two sheriff’s deputies were ambushed and viciously shot, and they can never be the same.  They’re getting better, but they can never be the same. 
     I’ll always stand by our heroes of law enforcement, and we want to stop this horrible rhetoric and stop it fast. 
     I want to ask Scott Atlas to say a couple of words, because I heard Biden talking today about, “He wants to come up with a distribution plan.”  A distribution — for the vaccine that we came up with.
     A couple of things: We came up with that vaccine — it’ll be announced fairly soon — but regardless, this month, next month — in a level of time that nobody thought was possible because of what we did with our FDA in terms of streamlining it.  I want to thank Dr. Hahn. 
     But what we’ve done with the streamlining has been incredible, and very safely.  Number one is safety.  Number two is speed.  But you can have perfect safety and have much more speed, and that’s what we did. 
     We did this for more than the vaccine, having to do with the China virus.  This was also for other things.  So many other great drugs are out there that would take 10, 12 years to get them approved, and we’ve moved those schedules up a lot. 
     But if this were Obama-Biden, this would have taken two, three years before you were at a stage where we are now at.  So we’re going to be very soon.  And it’s sort of funny to watch Joe Biden getting up and reading a teleprompter and saying how — how he would have done this.  They had H1N1.  He calls it the “N1H1”; it’s H1N1.  It’s called the swine flu, and it was a disaster. 
     And, as I said, the person that ran it for him said the worst things about it.  I mean, just — they didn’t know what they were doing, they quit.  They had no clue.  And that was easy, by comparison to this.  This is the most contagious — contagious flu or virus that anybody has seen.  This is unbelievable how contagious it is.  You found that out. 
     But I watched Biden quickly as he discussed, without having — without knowing a thing about a distribution plan.  And he said that we don’t have a distribution plan, but we do indeed.  Our military — we have military, we have everybody involved.  It’s — it’s a great plan, and it’s a plan like no other. 
     And we can start doing it, I believe, the day that we come up with the vaccine.  When it’s done, we’ll start.  That same day, or the day after.  Our military is very much involved, and they deploy troops, they deploy — these are the generals that do logistics and all of those things.  And we’ll have it all over the county, and then, ultimately, hopefully we’ll helping the world with the vaccine.  And it’s very exciting. 
     But maybe I’d ask Scott Atlas to come up and describe a little bit about that and the distribution plan, in particular, because Biden acted as though there was no distribution plan, and we’ve been working on this for months, and it’s ready.  And Scott has really taken a hold of it and done an incredible job. 
     And please, Scott.  Thank you. 
     DR. ATLAS:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I didn’t develop the plan, I’m just relaying information here.  And — but this is a plan that’s a 57-page document that was sent to every state today, and there is a different part of this that was given to Congress today.  It was released by HHS.  It’s on the website.  And, in fact, I thought it was covered actually by the media, so I don’t think it’s a surprise, but it’s a comprehensive plan.  It’s a public-private partnership to get everything done in terms of logistics.
     The IT that’s necessary to trace the first dose — because some of these vaccines are anticipated to be two doses — there is tailoring, of course, by the states, and there are specifics.  And there’s an administration of the vaccine plan that will be done in over 51,000 outlets, including for — particular attention to minority areas, over 14,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers. 
     And as the President just said, within the first 24 hours of FDA’s approval under an emergency use, we will have vaccines being delivered within the first 24 hours, and it will be done at virtually no cost to Americans. 
     And the terms of the dosage: There will be — is it anticipated that no later than January all the top priority people will have received the vaccine or be able to receive the vaccine.  And so that kind of prioritization, which is the general prioritization done for all vaccines that are developed, particularly in a pandemic setting, goes to the high-risk people, the people with other underlying conditions, as well as first responders and people working directly in healthcare.  And so that’s going to be done very rapidly.
     Okay.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Good, thank you.
     DR. ATLAS:  Thank you.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-september-16-2020/

1:30 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I just spoke with the President, and he wanted to thank the commissioner of Big 10 football, Kevin Warren, and all of the players, parents, coaches, and fans who wanted more than anything to play football. 
     The President was happy to get this thing going.  And now you will have players in Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Nebraska who will now have access to football, which is very good to see. 
     Transitioning to a much more somber topic and one that is very important to the President, I want to talk a little bit about our police officers. 
     Fourteen months ago, two deputies with the Los Angeles Police Department were sworn in to protect and serve their community.  This past Saturday, these two deputies were ambushed.  While sitting in their patrol car in Compton, California, a suspect approached the passenger-side window, took aim, and fired multiple shots at point-blank range into the patrol car. 
     “I’ve been shot.  Send help,” begged one of the deputies over 911.  This was a cowardly, brazen, and unprovoked attack against law enforcement.  One of the deputies attacked was a 31–year-old mother of a 6-year-old boy.  She was seen on security footage attending to the wounds of her partner, despite being shot in the jaw and arm herself.  She is a true hero. 
     Rushed to the hospital, these two deputies were targeted yet again.  The L.A. County Sheriffs tweeted this: “To the protesters blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM yelling ‘We hope they die’ referring to 2 LA Sheriff’s ambushed today in #Compton…” they said this: “DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES & EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL.  People’s lives are at stake.”  Truly despicable behavior from those protesters. 
     People’s lives are indeed at stake.  And it is truly, quote, “a double miracle,” as the Los Angeles Sheriff, Alex Villanueva, described it, that these two deputies are alive today. 
     Targeting a police officer is an assault against your community.  It is an assault against law and order.  It is antithetical to what we value as Americans. 
     We all remember the disastrous impact of the Ferguson effect.  We do not want to see a repeat today.  “Defund the police” is not just dangerous policy; it is a poisonous ideology.  We must respect our police, not revolt against them. 
     In the past 24 hours alone, we’ve seen law enforcement targeted across the country — this is in 24 hours: In Phoenix — in Phoenix, a U.S. Marshal was ambushed and shot outside a federal courthouse in a drive-by shooting.  In Lynwood, California, a suspect approached a patrol car and fired a handgun into the passenger-side window.  In Suffolk, Virginia, a suspect opened fire on a marked police car, hitting the vehicle three times.  This is within 24 hours. 
     These acts are despicable.  Rhetoric such as “defund the police” is likely to have negative consequences for law enforcement across the country, threatening the safety of our communities. 
     As Los Angeles Sheriff Villanueva warned, the ambush in Compton is a, quote, “sober reminder.  It’s a dangerous job.”  “Actions, words have consequences,” he said.  “Our job does not get any easier because people do not like law enforcement.  It pisses me off,” he said.  “It dismays me at the same time.  There’s no pretty way to say it.”
     The President wants law and order, which is the best way to ensure peace on our streets.  And he wants our police to be respected and protected.

     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Today, President Trump was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his work in brokering an Israel-United Arab Emirates peace deal.  It was a historic deal and the first such deal in over two decades.  This is a hard-earned and well-deserved honor for this President.
     President Trump’s foreign policy will always be one of peace through strength, and that is what the American people are seeing abroad.  Career politicians merely talk about the kind of results this President has achieved on the world stage. 
     End endless wars: We hear that often, but not too often do we see it actually done.  Today, the President and the Pentagon and the Department of Defense are announcing a drawdown of troops in Iraq — just announced from 5,200 to 3,000. 
     We are getting our allies to pay their fair share.  Now nine NATO countries are meeting their 2 percent spending obligations. 
     We’ve secured better trade deals for the American worker.  President Trump negotiated the USMCA, the U.S.-South Korea deal; ended the Trans-Pacific Partnership; brought back manufacturing jobs.
     President Trump has stood up to China: the phase one China deal; also tariffs to hold China accountable; and actions to block Huawei. 
     President Trump has also defeated terrorists.  The ISIS caliphate is destroyed.  Al-Baghdadi is no longer on the battlefield, along with Iranian General Soleimani. 
     In addition to these priorities, President Trump has made peace a cornerstone of his recent foreign policy efforts.  The peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates led to the first flight from Israel over Saudi Arabia’s airspace to the United Arab Emirates.  The signing ceremony for this historic deal will be September 15th at the White House. 
     President Trump has also brokered economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo, a major breakthrough in this decades-old conflict. 
     It’s a fact: President Trump “has broken the 39-year-old streak of American Presidents either starting a war or bringing the United States into an international armed conflict,” as a great Washington Examiner piece headline read. 
     These wins are possible because of the President’s leadership and outsider perspective.  President Trump addresses old challenges with new solutions and delivers results for the American people. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.  Paula.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-9-9-2020/

5:45 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody, very much.  Thank you.  So, as we begin Labor Day Weekend, America’s unprecedented economic recovery continues.  You see what’s going on.  It’s been pretty amazing.  The United States economy added today — announced this morning — 1.4 million jobs last month, bringing the total to over 10.6 million jobs created in just four months.  That’s a record, by far. 
     In August, we added 249,000 retail jobs; 174,000 leisure and hospitality jobs; and 29,000 new manufacturing jobs.  The unemployment rate plummeted to 8.4 percent, the second-largest, single-month drop ever recorded, surpassed only by our big decline in June. 
     Last month, we saw large declines in the unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans — very big declines.  We’re witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from any economic crisis in history, by far. 
     By contrast, the last administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history.  That was well documented, as you know. 
     This year, the United States has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major Western nation, and we are recovering at a much faster rate than any other nation. 
     Business confidence is higher today in America than in any other G7 or EU country — that covers a lot of territory.  So we have the business confidence is higher than many — than any of those countries. 
     In July, retail sales not only recovered, but reached a new all-time high.  So think of that: retail sales.  That’s a very basic statistic, and it’s a big statistic.  It not only recovered, but reached the highest level ever.  Auto sales have surged to an incredible 74 percent since their April low and are nearly back to their pre-virus levels.  And that’s been a tremendous thing.  Used cars and new cars have been both doing incredibly well. 
     Mortgage applications were 27 percent higher in August than during the same period last year.  Homebuilder sentiment reached the highest level on record, indicating that more high-paying construction jobs are on the way.  Homebuilding has been great and lending has been really incredible.  U.S. manufacturing activity reached a 19-month high in August. 
     While my administration has fought every day to restore prosperity, however, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are holding additional China virus relief hostage to — to reasons that nobody understands.  I guess I do; I think I understand.  It’s called politics. 
     And speaking of politics, I think North Carolina, I think that Michigan and Pennsylvania and other states, they should open.  The governors — the Democrat governors — should open their states.  They’ll open them on November 4th.  But they should open them now.  It’s very unfair to the people to have those shutdowns continuing at the level that they’re continuing. 
     Democrats are insisting on a massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states, stimulus checks for illegal aliens, and the mass release of inmates from jail.  They want to release a lot of inmates, some of them for very serious reasons.  They want to release them from jail.  They want that part — as part of a stimulus package, can you believe it? 
     It’s time for the Democrats in Congress to start working across the aisle and put the American people first. 
     Now, we have $300 billion in a — an account that we didn’t use — $300 billion.  And we are willing to use that.  I would be willing to release it, subject to Congress, and use that as stimulus money, and it would go right to the American people.  So we have $300 billion sitting in an account that we didn’t need because things are going so well with the economy. 
     But it would be a very appropriate thing to release that to the American people, and I am willing to do it; all we need as a signoff.  But that doesn’t mean that we’re going to release prisoners.  Some prisoners — some very vicious people, actually.  We’re not going to put them on the streets like the Democrats want us to, and we’re not going to give stimulus checks to illegal aliens.  They came into the country illegally, and now we give them a check?  We want to give the checks to the American people.
     So, remember, we have $300 million [billion]; it’s there.  We don’t need the money.  We don’t need anything.  Just let that money get released to the American people. 
     As our economy rebounds, there’s only one thing that could stop the extraordinary economic comeback and wipe out the future of American workers — and that’s what the Democrats want to do with a $4 trillion tax hike — implementing things that will be really bad for our country.  And this will just absolutely cripple what we’re doing on regulations and so many other elements of success. 
     We had the greatest economy in history, prior to the China virus coming in.  Now they want to stop regulations.  They want to bring up regulations to a level — stop the things that we’re doing, which are at a much smaller level, and bring up regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before. 
     They want to do things that will make it impossible for any economy to grow.  They want to ban fracking.  And as you saw — ban, ban, ban.  And all of a sudden, he sees his polls going down, and now he says, “Well, I was only talking about not maybe banning fracking,” but he wants to ban fracking. 
     And it doesn’t matter what he wants to ban; the people that control him want to ban fracking.  And whether it’s Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota — so many other states — you can’t ban fracking.  That would be a disaster — Ohio.  They want to abolish American energy — I mean, that’s what’s going to happen; adopt disastrous trade deals; and inflict a devastating shutdown. 
     As you know, he said we want to shut it down: “We would be willing to shut it down.”  And you don’t shut down when we’re setting records.  And, by the way, we’re rounding the corner.  We’re rounding the corner on the virus. 
     Joe Biden’s blanket shutdown would collapse our economy.  It would cause countless deaths from suicide, drug, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and more.  You know, shutdowns cause a lot of problems — a lot of very serious problems — more so than the virus itself.  Biden’s plan is not a solution; it’s a virtual surrender. 
     And our country is doing so well.  We’re starting to do so well.  I think we’re going to have a great third quarter.  I mean, you’re going to see for yourself because the numbers will be announced sometime prior to the election on November 3rd.
     And as you know, Joe spent his entire career sending American jobs to China and other faraway countries.  For 47 years, people were pillaging our country — taking our jobs, taking our companies.  And that’s never going to change with that mindset and with that group.  Biden is not going to be standing up to these foreign countries.  He’s not going to be standing up — maybe more importantly — to the people that run the Democrat Party.  He doesn’t have the strength to do that.
     He refuses even to condemn Antifa — a bad group, a far-left domestic terrorist organization.  He doesn’t want to say anything bad about it.  His plan to appease to the domestic terrorists is the exact opposite of what I’m doing now.  I think you saw that last night.
     Yesterday, the U.S. Marshals — we sent them in.  U.S. Marshals.  We were waiting for local government to take care of it, but they didn’t do that, so the U.S. Marshals went in — law enforcement.  They took down the Antifa member who murdered a man in the middle of a street in Portland.  The suspect was killed after drawing a weapon, when officers attempted to take him into custody.  They wanted to take him in — the U.S. Marshals, incredible people. 
     So I want to thank them for their strength, their bravery.  And I really do wish that the mayor of Portland and the governor of Oregon would get going and stop the crime in that city.  It’d be so easy to do.
     While we’re focused on creating good-paying jobs, the radical left is focused on unleashing vi- — really violent mobs.  And you see that.  Whether you’re conservative or liberal; Republican, Democrat, or independent, we must all agree the need for peace and order and safety.
     Under my administration, law enforcement is conducting arrests nationwide of rioters, looters, and domestic terrorists.  The reason we didn’t put Chicago into our list — where we’re holding back funds from some of these states and cities that are doing such a poor job, such an incompetent job — a job that nobody can even imagine how bad.  And we’re holding it back until they get their act together.
     And we are having a lot of people in Chicago right now, and you notice that their numbers are going down rapidly.  But we have — we’ve deployed a lot of federal law enforcement inside of Chicago, and they’re taking out quite a few people.  And they’re being arrested; they’re being put in jail.  And that’s why you see those numbers going down.  That’s why you see that, with respect to the mayor, we did not hold back funds in Chicago.
     But New York is experiencing a tremendous crime wave; in some cases, up over 300 percent.  And they have to do something quickly.
     We just spoke to Mayor Bowser, and she’s willing to do whatever is necessary.  We had a very good talk with her.  That’s in D.C.
     And the other places, they speak for themselves.
     We’re working with the state and local authorities to comb through hours of video tape, identifying arrest suspects; and prosecute lawbreakers.  We’ve already got over 300 in jail, and we have tremendous evidence.
     And I want to thank the media for helping us out because they’re taking different angles — we have it from every different angle.  You can’t probably have any better than what we’ve got.  We see it from the sky and the ground, and from the right and from the left.  So when they say they didn’t do it, we say, “Well, what’s this?”  So we get that from the media, free of charge.
     Under Operation LeGend, we’ve surged federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime.  The initiative has already resulted in tremendous success.  And nationwide, we have over 2,000 arrests.  We don’t talk about it too much, but now we might as well.  So we’ve arrested over 2,000 criminals.  They’re criminals.  And in a single month, murder rate in Chicago — as you know, and as I said — it was cut in half, actually.
     So, on the China virus front, the nations of Europe have experienced a 38 percent greater excess mortality than the United States — 38 percent more greater excess mortality than the United States.  A lot of you don’t want to report that.  And if we took New York out of the equation, there’s nobody even close.  The job we’ve done is incredible.  And we don’t get any credit for it, but we’ve done an incredible job.
     Through Operation Warp Speed, we have three vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials.  Yesterday, Pfizer announced — I just spoke to the head of Pfizer, great guy.  They announced that it expects to have the results of its trial very, very shortly — next month — but very shortly.
     We remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1st.  We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October.  And Pfizer is among the leaders, as you know, and it’s a great company.  Johnson & Johnson also doing very well.  Moderna.  We have some really great companies.  They’re all doing very well.  They’re all in final stages, and I think you’re going to see results that are shockingly good.
     Finally, I want to provide you with a brief update of the virus.  Cases in the United States have declined 28 percent nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have continued to decline over the past week — very substantially decline. 
     Thanks to America’s medical genius, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 percent in April.  Mortality rate reduced by 85 percent.  Hospital lengths of stay are one third of their average length in April.  So the hospitalization is down.  The length of stay is way down.
     In order to keep making progress against the virus, we ask all Americans to remain vigilant, especially over Labors Da- — Labor Day.  You know, you have the Labor Day Weekend coming upon us immediately — I guess we can say — pretty immediately.  And we need everybody to be careful, to apply common sense, and do all of the things that we’ve told you to do as quickly — as much as you can — social distancing, wearing a mask whenever the distancing is not possible, and staying like — staying with a group that you know. 
     Let’s just try and get through this one weekend, and I think we have a chance of doing that.  Just social distance, wash your hands — all of the hygiene things that we speak about.  And we’re really rounding the turn.
     And the vaccines are coming.  The therapeutics have already come, but they continue to come.  The convalescent plasma has had a tremendous impact already; you see what’s happening there.  And remdesivir has been incredible.
     So we have a lot of things happening.  We have a lot of therapeutics coming out.  I think — from the standpoint of common sense, I guess, therapeutics, to me — right now, you go into a hospital, you give somebody a shot or — or a transfusion.  It might be a transfusion; probably more than 50 percent are actually transfusions.  And they’ll leave the hospital shortly thereafter.  I mean, to me, that’s more important, in a certain sense, than the vaccine.  But the vaccines will be great over the long term; the therapeutics over the short term.
     And also knowing you have the therapeutics, I think, is great from the standpoint of mind — from the standpoint of the mind.  That’s great.
     So I want to thank everybody for being here.  I’m going to ask Larry Kudlow to give a couple of examples of how strong our economy is recovering, how strongly it’s recovering.  And it’s setting records at every level, and we’re doing better than every other country.  And we’re very proud of all of the people for doing such an incredible job.  This is a “V.”  It’s a “super V.”
     Again, we have $300 billion ready to go.  All Congress has to do is say, “Use it.”  If they say, “Use it” — I’d like to use it without their permission, but I guess I’m not allowed to do that.  I did ask that question.  So Congress has to just say, “Use it.”  All they have to do is say, “Use it”; $300 billion gets immediately put into our system, and will really help the American people.  There’s nothing else to do — just a very quick statement.
     So I’m going to ask Larry to come up.  I want to thank another man for being here today.  There’s a man that’s a incredible leader: Lou Holtz.  I’ve known him for a long time.  He’s been a friend of mine.  And I think I’ve received letters from every football coach, almost, in the nation.  And that’s a little exaggeration, but some — some of the greats.  Nick Saban wrote a letter.  Coach O — and Coach O is central casting.  I said, “We’re going to have to put him in a movie” — right? — “as a football coach.”  He’d really be good playing a football coach like you.  And Urban Meyer wrote a beautiful letter.  And so many of the other great, legendary coaches.
     Not only coaches though — people in sports and people in life and even great political people, recommending Lou for the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  And we’ve analyzed it very closely.  We’ve looked at all of those recommendations.  We’ve looked at Lou’s life and his career and what he’s done for charity.  And the football is obvious — he was a great coach — but what he’s done, beyond even coaching.
     So Lou will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  And a date is being picked; it won’t be in the too-distant future.  Lou was married to a great woman.  Right, Lou?  A great woman.  And she just passed away a few months ago.  This is an incredible woman.  She was stronger — I knew her; I knew her well — she was stronger than Lou.  I think she was stronger than you, Lou, I hate to tell you.  You’re strong, too.  But she was special, right?
     So I just want to congratulate Coach Lou Holtz on — soon to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  And we look forward to that, Lou.  Thank you very much.  And you can stay around and listen to Larry for a couple of seconds or —
     MR. HOLTZ:  I — I listen to Larry —
     THE PRESIDENT:  — or go to your friend.
     MR. HOLTZ:  — every chance I can.
     THE PRESIDENT:  You probably know half of the people in the room.  I’ll bet they treat you better than they treat me.  They treat him good.  I wish you’d treat me that way.
     Larry, come on up.
     MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, sir.  I appreciate it.  Again, Coach, many congrats.  Many, many congrats.
     Just to underscore the President’s assessment of the economy: very strong jobs report today, 8.4 percent unemployment rate, 1.4 million payrolls increase.  But I want to add: 3.8 million — 3.8 million increase in the important household survey, which aims at small businesses particularly, and from which the unemployment is calculated.  In the past four months, we’ve generated a 10.6 million increase in payrolls and a 14 million increase in households.  So we’ve restored basically half of the jobs that were lost in the pandemic contraction.
     Today’s report also included the lower-wage industries and minority groups across the board.  The diffusion index was a whopping 69 percent.  So these gains are very, very broad based.  There’s still too many people out.  There’s still too much hardships, still too many unemployed.  And we are working on that, and we are moving in the right direction.  And that’s why today’s numbers are encouraging and optimistic.
     Now, other areas that the President mentioned, just to underscore — we are in a housing boom.  There can be no disagreement about that: sales, mortgage applications, prices, home starts of 23 percent annually in July.  We’re in a car boom — automobile boom.  We’ve gone from 8.7 million in sales to 15.2 million in sales in the recent four months.  That’s a big jump.  As the President mentioned, a leading indicator of that is used car sales and prices. 
     The manufacturing indexes are very strong.  This recovery includes manufacturing.  The ISM is running in the high 50s, the new order index is at 68, production index is 63.  We had a manufacturing report for durables — core durables — over the past three months — orders up 35 percent, shipments up 35 percent.  So these are very strong numbers.  New business applications from 25,000 to 66,000.  It’s 160 percent gain through August.  And as the President referred, consumer spending is booming.  We’re up 84 percent annually over the past three months. 
     My view, of course, we are in a “V”-shaped recovery.  It is a self-sustaining recovery.  High-demand, increased production and manufacturing, along with a decline in inventories will give us a tremendous momentum going into the second half of the year.  I still reckon that the third quarter will be at least 20 percent growth.  The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow index is close to 30 percent.  I think 20 percent is a good number.  I think the whole second half and next year, provided that economic policies remain pro-growth —
     And I just want to mention one thing:  On the policy front, I simply don’t understand the other side wanting a $4 trillion tax increase after a deep pandemic contraction.
     And on this point, I believe, a vast majority of economists — I don’t care if you’re a Keynesian demand-sider or supply-sider — you just don’t raise taxes by this amount or by any amount, really.  But $4 trillion?  Really picking the pockets of taxpayers who are returning to work now and need all the resources they can get — you just don’t do it.  The profession should be — have a complete consensus on that.  And so I’m quite surprised and I think that is a potential obstacle, and people are beginning to speak about that.
     But all I can say is, factually, the numbers are coming in very positively.  There’s a lot of optimism going on, more work to be done, but we’re rolling in the right direction, sir. 
     Thank you.  Appreciate it.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Larry, very much.
     Okay, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-september-4-2020/

431,Trump,2020-09-04 08:50:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Ambassador O’Brien, Ambassador Grenell, Senior Advisor Kushner, and Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany | September 4, 2020",Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:50 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  It’s another historic day here at the White House.  And I have with me Ambassador Ric Grenell, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, and Senior Advisor Jared Kushner to talk to you about the history that was made here at the White House today, and then they’ll take a few of your questions.
     AMBASSADOR O’BRIEN:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  Again, it was a great morning in the Oval Office with President Trump, President Vučić, and Prime Minister Hoti.  We brought together — through the hard work of great diplomats, primarily led by Ric Grenell, acting at the President’s direction — Serbia and Kosovo.  And they’ve normalized their economic relations.  This is a — the Serbia-Kosovo conflict has gone on for decades.  They’ve been stuck, unable to move forward, for many, many years.
     And the President, sometime ago, decided that we try — we needed to try something creative and try something new, break the deadlock and bring — try to move forward with the peace process with Serbia and Kosovo. 
     To have the Prime Minister of Kosovo and the President of Serbia together in the Oval Office was something — given the history of those two countries, and given the history of the United States with respect to Serbia and the conflict in the Balkans, is something that is quite remarkable. 
     And to have this happen just in the shadow — a few days after Jared and I were on the flight from Ben Gurion Airport to Abu Dhabi International Airport — the first commercial flight between Israel and a Gulf Arab state — it shows the sort of momentum that’s coming.
     One of the side benefits of the normalization of economic ties between Serbia and Kosovo, was a — the establishment of diplomatic relations between Kosovo, a majority-Muslim state, and the State of Israel.  This is now the second time in less than a month that Israel has made peace with and has normalized its ties with a majority-Muslim country.  It’s — again, it’s another really signal accomplishment of President Trump.
     The fact that this has happened on the heels of a peace agreement with the Taliban in Afghanistan, that it’s happened in response — on the heels of last year, negotiating a peace — a ceasefire between the Kurds and the Turks, you’re seeing a pattern here of the President being a true peacemaker.
     And there’s been plenty of criticism of the administration, but what’s been interesting to me is: As the President has undertaken these historic initiatives and brought together a team to perform and deliver these accomplishments, others have even tried to take credit.  I was just watching the Vice President — without making a political comment — the Vice President was welcoming these moves today. 
     But these things could only happen under a Trump administration and under the President’s leadership — a “peace through strength” foreign policy and national security policy. 
     He put the pieces in place.  And now we’re reaping the peace dividend, and it’s happened in the Balkans, it’s happened in the Middle East, and we have more to come.  I’ll leave some of that to Senior Advisor Kushner to address in a moment. 
     So, with those opening comments, I want to turn the time over to the Special Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo — the Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo, Ambassador Ric Grenell.  He’ll have a few comments, and then we’ll make ourselves available for some questions after Ric and Jared address you. 
     Thank you very much.
     AMBASSADOR GRENELL:  Thanks, Robert.  I know there’s a lot of reporters who have worked a long time in your industry, and for any reporter that has been working for more than 10 years, you will know this story.  There was a terrible war.  And this story has been lingering for decades.  And so I really want to appeal to you all as journalists to dig deep on this story.  This is one of those good-news stories that I’m not asking you to do anything but look at the facts and look at really what’s been happening here.  We’ve been working very hard on this agreement for a long time. 
     We had three agreements last year that went largely unnoticed by Washington reporters.  And I just really have to say I think it’s a shame when we — when we talk a lot about symbolism and we don’t dig deep on these stories that last 21 years. 
     What we’ve been able to accomplish here by pushing the two parties together is truly historic.  The way that this came about is that the politics were stuck.  Everybody knows that.  We’ve been fighting and talking about the same thing for decades.  They have been fighting about the same symbolism, words, verbs, adjectives.  It’s been a nightmare.
     And what President Trump said to me was, “They’re fighting politically about everything.  Why don’t we give it a try to do something different and creative?  Why not try to do economics first and let the politics fall — follow the economics?”  That proved to actually be a formula that they were eager for.  No one had been talking to them about this. 
     We have an establishment foreign policy team in Washington, D.C., that literally keeps pounding the same meetings and issues over and over.
     I’m telling you that the only way that this agreement could have happened is from an outsider.  All of the insiders in Washington said, “You’re not talking about recognition, you’re not talking about this symbolic word.”  And what we tried to do is ignore that, and, from an outsider perspective, go in and dig deep.
     I ask you to look at this agreement and see all of the details that have been hard-fought negotiated that will move both economies and the entire region forward. 
     This is economic normalization.  It’s a first step.  I think the Europeans are going to be very happy.  We’ve been on the phone a couple of times with the national security advisor in Germany, the national security advisor in France to be — to brief them.  We briefed them on the strategy.  And we are briefing them again today on the details of this agreement. 
     This is something that I feel very strongly about.  It will make Americans safer.  It’ll make American companies more prosperous.  This is a region that’s been largely shut out because of a perceived conflict.  Whether or not there’s been a conflict, there has been a perceived conflict.  European businesses and American businesses largely have refused to go in and grow in these areas. 
     Now we will be able to open this up, whether it’s in energy; water; construction of roads, railways, mines.  These are all industries that are going to be opened up to European and, hopefully, American businesses to go in and help the people create an industry, which means creating jobs in the region, but also U.S. jobs — jobs for Americans and American companies. 
     The last thing I’ll say before we turn it over to Jared: The people of Serbia and the people of Kosovo are ecstatic about this agreement and are very thankful that there was an outside administration to look at this situation and not do the typical political thing.  If we would have done the typical political thing and listened to all of the really smart people at NGOs and think tanks here in Washington, D.C., we would not have this agreement. 
     Take just a quick look at the criticism in the lead-up to this of what we should have been talking about and what we weren’t talking about.  It’s all been squarely in the same, old political dialogue that was stuck, and I’m really thankful that President Trump challenged us to say, “Think differently.  Think from an outsider’s perspective.”  And that was the key to the whole thing. 
     So I really urge you to look at the details and see and talk to the leaders in Kosovo and Serbia.  Ask them how this came about.  Ask them how the process went.  And I think you’ll see that this outsider perspective of doing things differently is what worked.
     MR. KUSHNER:  Thank you, Ambassador Grenell, and incredible job working through this historic agreement, and Ambassador O’Brien. 
     This is just another chapter that this administration has been able to write towards making the world a safer and more peaceful place.  President Trump, when he ran for politics, was not a politician.  He sees things in a — through a prism that not a lot of politicians look through, which is: “How can I truly do things that will make people’s lives better, make people find common interests and opportunities, and figure out ways to resolve conflicts that, quite frankly, politicians have allowed to go on for far too long?” 
     Today’s breakthrough really is historic.  And we have had so many historic things this week that we shouldn’t be minimizing the significance of all the different things that happened.
     I started the week with Ambassador O’Brien in Jerusalem where we met with the Prime Minister and then took the first-ever flight — commercial flight from Israel to United Arab Emirates.  We broke that barrier, which brought a lot of hope to the Middle East.
     And for the last years, I’ve been listening to a lot of people tell us and the administration all of the things we were doing wrong; why we were looking at this the wrong way.  And what the President has done is he’s reversed now 20 years of bad foreign policy in the Middle East where we’ve allowed our country to get trapped in a lot of these wars that, quite frankly, you know, don’t do much for our country. 
     We have to make sure that we’re keeping our country safe, and we need to figure out how we can get people in the Middle East and Europe to get along so that we can spend our resources and our treasure on building up our countries and building up our cities and helping our citizens. 
     And what you’ve seen through President Trump’s first three and a half years is he’s ended — he’s trying to end a lot of these endless wars, he’s making peace agreements, he’s bringing people together, and he’s bringing our troops back home to America, while figuring out how to get along with different countries and reducing the foreign threats that we have.
     Second, this week, obviously, we were in Saudi Arabia, and then Saudi Arabia announced the historic opening of their air space, which again brings people in the Middle East closer together.  And then, yesterday, Bahrain announced the same thing: that they’ll be opening up their air space, which again will allow flights and better commerce and interaction between peoples to happen in the Middle East in a much quicker way.
     Today, we announced another normalization with Israel, which, quite frankly, a lot of the divide between the anti-Semitism that we have in the world, the terrorism we have in the world comes from the notion that people are divided.  And leaders will exploit divisions and religious differences to try and keep people divided, to cause conflict, often to maintain power for themselves that they mask in an ideological way.
     This breakthrough, again, brings people closer and shows people in the world that anything is possible if we push for it.
     And again, fundamentally, President Trump believes that no matter who you are, no matter where you’re from, no matter what country you’re in, all people want the same thing, which is they want the opportunity to live freely, live better lives, have economic opportunity, and live in peace.
     And today, again, is another historic step forward that politicians have spoken about for decades but haven’t been able to deliver on.  And it’s another victory for this administration and, really, for the world. 
     And so I want to give my congratulations to the people of Serbia and the people of Kosovo and to the people of Europe and also to the people of Israel who will, you know, reap tremendous benefits from this agreement. 
     So, thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-ambassador-obrien-ambassador-grenell-senior-advisor-kushner-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-september-4-2020/

1:11 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Two briefings ago I asked: “Where is Nancy Pelosi?”  Today, I can announce: We have found Nancy Pelosi.  As you can see, we found Nancy Pelosi going into her hair salon.  We will be playing the video on loop for all of you to see during the duration of this introduction.
Nancy Pelosi was not in the halls of Congress when I asked where she was.  She was not working in good faith to make a deal for the American people.  Nope.  Nancy Pelosi was found in San Francisco, at a hair salon, where she was indoors, even though salons in California are not — only open for outdoor service.  Apparently, the rules do not apply to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  She wants small businesses to stay shut down but only reopen for her convenience.  “Do as I say, not as I do,” says Nancy Pelosi.
Nancy Pelosi is holding up $1.3 trillion in relief for the American people, while getting special access to the very kind of small businesses that this money would support, businesses like this hair salon.
Before she skipped town to violate her state’s health guidelines, Pelosi proposed a bill.  It was called the HEROES Act, which contained no additional Paycheck Protection funding.   This is funding that would help the very small business she has bizarrely accused of plotting against her.
The President sees through Democrats’ disregard for Americans in need, and he took action, unilaterally, on his own accord.  He provided relief from evictions.  He provided unemployment insurance.  He paused student loan payments.  And he cut the payroll tax, putting money in American people’s pockets.
Congress also failed to authorize funding to provide children with free lunches for the 2020-2021 school year.
And again, President Trump, with Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump, took action.  And now USDA has extended a summer program which will ensure children continue to have access to free meals through the end of the year.
Nancy Pelosi is demanding an apology from a single mother and small-business owner who has received threats since Nancy Pelosi’s comments against her salon.  Salon owner Erica Kious said this: “Since this happened, I have received nothing but hate text messages, death threats, saying they’re going to burn down my hair salon.  It’s just sad that my community is pulling this, saying that I threw her under the bus when I did not.  So, that’s hurtful.  But, yes, I think I’m pretty much done now.”
Nancy Pelosi, you ought to apologize to the American people, or better yet, come back to Washington and get to work for hardworking Americans like this salon owner that you maligned and demanded an apology from.
And with that, I’ll take questions.
Yes, Jon.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-090320/

5:45 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I’d like to begin by saying we’ve just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market — Dow — in 36 years. That’s very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401(k)s and with the stocks that they have. And that’s a tremendous achievement: best in 36 years.
Let me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38 percent. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid, point-of-care tests. These tests return results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We’re being focusing — we’re focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high-risk populations. So we’re going to have the 15-minute, and less, tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point-of-care tests. That’s something.
This evening, I am pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials. So that’s joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and, hopefully, approval. In the United States, we’re doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months.
Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time.
I also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we’re seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, federal law enforcement is working with state and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists, and bring them to justice. We’ve just come up with a report that we’ve arrested a large number of people. It’s over 200. And you’ll be hearing about that, but they’ve been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We’re doing it very low key, but we’re trying to help cities. They are, in all cases, Democrat-run, but we’re doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent.
We’d like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately one hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don’t know why it’s good for him to have a city that’s falling apart and that’s under siege now for 94 days. But, really, it’s been under siege for years, if you know Portland.
So, to the mayor, I say: Whenever you’re ready, let us know. We’ll solve your problem of violence. We’ll solve your problem of crime. We’ll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you’ll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland.
The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the federal government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters, just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we’ve seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Biden — Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats; it’s Democrat-run cities, and it’s a shame, and it can be solved so easy. It can be solved very easily.
The violence is fueled by dangerous rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they’re very good at doing. We’ve taken that power away. They’re afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They’re afraid to be destroyed.
You saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republic — the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife Kelly. What they went through, but other people went through it too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is the public is very wise to it. They see what’s happening, and they’re wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly.
Left-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about, the — really, you hear this from people — what they’re saying, how they’re saying it — the violence, it’s terrible. And again, it’s Democrat politicians. I don’t know that they’re spurring it on or they’re afraid to stop it. But in any event, we’re there to help. We’re there to get things under control.
What they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And, frankly, the mayor — Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser — should have done a better job. She did a very poor job. But at the same time, we had the police, who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess, it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down but got right up, and two others joined them, and they were able to get Rand and Kelly through.
But it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar — not to the extent, in terms of taping. We don’t have to the tapes as strong, but some people went through — from what I heard — as bad, or worse.
The violent rioters share Biden’s same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, he didn’t mention the fact, and he didn’t mention the far left. He didn’t mention the far left, or, from what I saw, I don’t believe he mentioned the word “Antifa.” Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn’t mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement.
He went on point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn’t talk about those on the left. And those on the left are the problem, and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side: They’re both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious.
And until that neutralizes, you’re never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas. For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals repeating the monstrous lie that these were peaceful protests. They’re not peaceful protests. That’s anarchy. That’s — you look at the agitators, you look at the looters, you look at the rioters — that’s not a peaceful protest.
They keep using the term — it’s so nice — “peaceful protest.” And behind the reporter, the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I’ll be going tomorrow. And at least the governor asked me if I could, we would — I said, “You got to get the National Guard.” And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things, and that was about five days ago, six days ago. And ever since, it’s been very good.
Thirteen members of Biden’s campaign staff donated to bail and — rioters — they’re getting them out of jail. Looters — they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It’s outrageous that they’re now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem.
And they really want to put it on the — on the backs of the police. I see it. The police are — there’s just a war on law enforcement in this country. And without law enforcement, we wouldn’t have a country. We have very talented people; they’re not allowed to do their job.
If you give the radical-left power, what you’re seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they’ve had such problems.
To defeat them, we must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting. And that’s what we want to do.
They want to destroy our country. They’re going to destroy our suburbs. But I think I’ve gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration; they were going to be made much worse.
What we’re witnessing today is a result of left-wing indoctrination in our nation’s schools and universities. Many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism.
Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn’t even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren’t mentioned.
Two words that were taken out were the words “under God” — “under God” — two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance. In their caucus, I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said “That’s strange. What’s — that’s a big…” I tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn’t make a mistake. Then they did it later on.
So they took the word — essentially, took the word “God” out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We’re not taking the word “God” out of anything. We’re not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we’re not taking the great word “God” out of anything.
At our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left’s war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it’s good, but it’s gotten out of control. They’re unable to control this radical-left, crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly — very, very, quickly indeed.
The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our nation’s schools, where they’re trying to change everything that we’ve learned. What we’ve learned — in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason — cancel culture — whatever you want to call it.
At the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance — zero — for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the U.S. population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated.
Biden won’t even say the name “Antifa.” I don’t believe he said it today. He made a speech, and he didn’t mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn’t mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement, he mentioned the police, and — but he didn’t mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there’s no way that he’ll solve the problem. You don’t name it, you don’t solve it.
In fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants: the far-left policy agenda it’s asking for. And if that happened, we don’t have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn’t go away; they gain new power to spread the terror nationwide.
Most of our nation is extremely safe, by the way. You know, you only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago, and you see what’s happened in New York just in a very short period of time. It’s horrible what’s happened in New York. I love New York; I come from New York. And when I see — four years ago, I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He’s terrible mayor; one of the worst. I can’t say “the worst.” I mean, I — I’ve witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he’s certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what’s happening in New York, and I look at what’s happening in the city, and — so quickly. It happened so quickly. It’s a shame.
Biden’s strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he’s doing — I don’t think he even knows what he’s doing — and give them control over every lever of power in the United States government. But when you surrender to the mob, you don’t get freedom; you get fascism. That’s what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what — look what’s going on there and other places.
Biden is using — Biden is using mafia talking points: “The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want.” That’s what it is. “The mob will leave you alone. Give them what you want.” But it doesn’t work that way, because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking.
What happens is you give and give and give, and you take, and they no longer respect you. And that’s what’s happened with the Democrats, because I actually think they’ve lost control of these radical-left maniacs. I think they’ve lost control, because I don’t think they feel that’s helping them — when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland, and you look at Baltimore, and you look at so many different places and what’s going on there. The top 10 are all run by Democrats, and you can go a lot further down the list than 10.
In America, we will never surrender to mob rule because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we’re continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don’t even think about it. They wake up the next morning; they don’t even think about it.
This is the extreme left’s agenda for America: They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers.
No one will be safe. And, in fact, they want very much to let people in prison — like, as an example, the Boston bomber — they want to let everybody vote. If you’re in prison, if you’re the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don’t know, I don’t think that sells too well.
My administration is a very different approach. We want states to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard. We’re prepared. We’re ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country — East Coast, West Coast, doesn’t matter — we’re ready to move immediately, as we did in Minneapolis, as we did — we are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine.
Tomorrow, I’m going to a place where we moved very quickly — you know that — in Wisconsin. And we moved very, very quickly. And as soon as we moved, that was the end of that. It was very well behaved.
I’ll appoint more tough-on-crime prosecutors, support stiffer penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows. And we need order. We need — we need order. You can’t have cities run like these cities are run.
They gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more. And all of a sudden, they’ve lost these cities, but I’ll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, “Please come in.” As you know, they have to ask — unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don’t like to do that — they have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we’ll be there within a matter of minutes.
When I signed the executive order outlining 10-year prison sentences, as an example, for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was three months ago or so. I signed an order, and it said, “Ten years in prison.” Ten years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge, I haven’t seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They cancelled that march. They said 10 years is too long.
Before the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime. In the last two years of the Obama administration, murder increased 30 percent in major American cities, and we witnessed the largest two-year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century.
In the first two years of my presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation LeGend, surging federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. And we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot.
Since the beginning of Operation LeGend, we have conducted more than 1,000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third; got it down 33 percent. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don’t know that, but we sent them into Chicago without fanfare at all. But we cut it down in half; it’s still far too high. And if they’d ask for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we’d be able to cut it down to a very low number.
While I am President, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe. And we do — we honor our police; we honor our law enforcement.
I have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most — most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of — the sheriffs in Florida — all of them; law enforcement in Ohio; in Texas; North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I’ve gotten all of it. We’ll have to do a little study so I’m totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn’t, I think we have to look at them — where do they come from.
So we — we’ve done a real job. We’re ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don’t even have to put it in writing. We’ll put it in writing later. We’ll get them in there, and we’ll straighten out the city very quickly — whichever city we may be talking about.
So those governors that are responsible for a state that has a city that’s got a lot of problems: Call me or the mayor can call me, and we’ll be there very quickly.
Tomorrow, we’re making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we’re proud of it because, in six days, it’s been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately.
Okay, please. Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-8-31-2020/

1:03 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: Good afternoon, everyone. The President shows up. When the Trump administration arrives in a Democrat-run city engulfed in chaos, peace is restored, law and order is upheld.
Washington D.C., New York, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Kenosha: all of these cities are Democrat-run; all of these cities have experienced anarchy, violence, and destruction in recent days — the opposite of a peaceful protest.
This is the reality facing American cities and towns across the country. This is not hypothetical. These are real people and real lives that have been impacted.
Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, rejected federal law enforcement in an irrational and tone-deaf letter. Mayor Wheeler might have thought he put political points on the board, but the very next day, a protester was shot and killed on the streets of his city.
Before the Trump administration took action in Kenosha, businesses were burned, property damaged, and chaos was rampant. Then, nearly 1,000 National Guard troops and 200 DOJ personnel were deployed at the request of local officials. President Trump showed up, and law and order arrived.
Nationally, according to the DOJ, 300 have been arrested and 302 charged amid riots and unrest. Democrats are late to the game. I’ve stood behind this podium and highlighted this issue for months. While this President is always willing to show up, it is incumbent on Democrats to step up: Invite federal law enforcement in; we stand ready. Do not tolerate anarchy, violence, and destruction. Rioting is not right. Secure your streets.
President Trump will visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, tomorrow. This president will show up. He will go to cities where Americans are hurting.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

5:32 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And it’s good to see you all.  Hope you had a great weekend at your convention.  And we’re going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.
But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I’d like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Yesterday, I approved a major disaster declaration for California.  I spoke to Governor Newsom as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their state.  That continues.  The federal government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires.  We’re working very closely with the governor and very closely with a lot of great state representatives and local representatives, and we’ll take care of the situation.  But we have 26,000 first responders already.
Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes.  As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire — one of the biggest we’ve ever seen — my administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly.  Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana two days later.  This is somewhat unprecedented — the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another.
Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico.  We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous — tremendous people.
We have — FEMA is lined up.  We have the Coast Guard ready.  The Coast Guard has — has done a fantastic job.  They do so many — they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.
I’m asking all Americans in the storm’s path to follow the instructions of your state and local governments very closely.  And I’ve approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana.  FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help.  They will be in there very quickly — very, very quickly.
And I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I’ve informed him.  And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go.  We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California.  So we have a great team.  Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.
On the therapeutics front, this is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time.  This is a great thing.  Today, I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.  The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization — and that’s such a powerful term: emergency use authorization — for a treatment known as convalescent plasma.  This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection.  It’s had an incredible rate of success.
Today’s action will dramatically expand access to this treatment.  And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar.  I want to thank the FDA — all of the people that have been working very hard on this.  It showed tremendous potential.
This is the only possible — and it’s only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed that has everybody working together.  We’re years ahead of approvals.  We would be — if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we’d be two years, three years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you’ll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.
To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we’re removing unnecessary barriers and delays not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government.
We’ve provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus.  Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent.  It’s a tremendous number.
The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease.
Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.  Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.
In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have — who have recovered — and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they’ve donated — but these are people recovering from the virus — to donate plasma.  Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled.
And today, I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today please.  It’s been really an incredible — just incredible people.  The country has united so strongly behind this.
And I’ll go over the numbers, but if you look at what’s happened and the success that we’ve had that people don’t talk about — the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world.  You don’t hear that.
The European Union’s case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States.  Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.
And I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words.  And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up — and especially over the last few days — in getting this done.  The results have been incredible, and I think you’ll see the results even go up very substantially.  So we appreciate it.
And maybe I’ll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen.  Thank you very much, Alex.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today.
Thanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19.  And thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world.
In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment.
President Trump is the Right to Try President, and he’s fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments.  Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use, and this FDA authorization is one result of that effort.
The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course — within three days of being diagnosed — with plasma containing high levels of antibodies benefited the most from treatment.  We saw about a 35 percent better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment — which were patients under 80 who were not on artificial respiration.
I just want to emphasize this point because I don’t want you to gloss over this — this number.  We dream, in drug development, of something like a 35 percent mortality reduction.  This is a major advance in the treatment of patients.  This is a major advance.
Convalescent plasma is one new tool that we’ve added to our arsenal against COVID-19, alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied.  Because of the President’s Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall.
Operation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing so that if they meet FDA’s gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.
Americans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to Coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight.  Know: If you donate plasma, you could save a life.
We’ve also provided guidance so healthcare providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.
So, thank you again, Mr. President, for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19.  And I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they’ve approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA.
And I’ll turn it over to Dr. Hahn if that’s okay, Mr.  President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thank you very much.
Please, Doctor.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  It’s good to be here today to announce FDA’s recent decision.  From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers.  And I just want to echo the President’s thanks to the more than 17,000 men and women who work at FDA.  They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.
So, plasma is the liquid portion of the blood.  That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection — in this case, COVID-19 — and that liquid portion can be extracted.  And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, it’s been given to patients with infectious diseases — for more than 100 years.  So there was a really good rationale for why this might work.
And, in fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded-access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the federal government, under President Trump’s leadership, and that has gone on for the last four months.  More than 90,000, close to 100,000 Americans have enrolled in this program and over 70,000 have received treatment.  This is one of the largest expanded-access programs in the history of FDA.  So, a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.
So, in the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data — not just the data from this expanded-access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this.  Those — those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization.
In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients, as described by Secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35 percent improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.
Now, we’re waiting for more data.  We’re going to continue to gather data.  But this clearly meets the criteria that we’ve established for emergency use authorization, and we’re very pleased with these results.
So, let me just put this in perspective.  Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35 percent improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit.  What that means is — and if the data continue to pan out — 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.
We’ve seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country.  And what this EUA does — EUA — emergency use authorization today does: It allows us to continue that and meet the demand.
And again, I want to echo the President’s and the Secretary’s ask of the American people: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, please donate.  It could save a life.
And, Mr. President, thank you again.

5:54 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I’d like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.
Today, I’m directing the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to notify the U.N. Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran.  It’s a snapback; it’s not uncommon.
Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which was a product of the Obama-Biden foreign policy failure — a failure like few people have seen, in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short-term deal.  This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to Iran — $150 billion, to be exact — plus $1.8 billion in cash, which I don’t know that the President have the authority to give.  He gave $1.8 billion in cash.  Just another great deal.  That turned out to be a total disaster.  It would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.
And I won’t say anything, because I don’t like saying it, but Iran doesn’t have so much money to give to the world anymore — to the terrorists, to give to al Qaeda and various other groups of people that they were funding.  They have to keep their own regime together, and it’s not easy for them.
And if and when I win the election, within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly.
But that deal was a disaster: 150 billion dollars; 1.8 billion dollars in cash.  And we got nothing, except a short-term, little deal.  A short-term, expiring.  It’s starting to expire already.  It’s terminated, but it would have, if we didn’t terminate it, start to expire very shortly.
A good deal was the deal we made with UAE and Israel.  And, by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal.  Countries that you wouldn’t even believe want to come into that deal.  And, all of a sudden, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East, and you couldn’t have done it with this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with Sleepy Joe Biden.
I imposed the toughest-ever sanctions on Iran, and this has caused great difficulty for them giving money to terrorist organizations.  And if they do, they’ll have hell to pay.
Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, in addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the two leading terrorists by far in the world.  The founder of ISIS.  Nobody even talks about that.  And we also defeated — we now have 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria.  When I took over, it was a mess.  It was a total mess.  It was — they were all over the place.
My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on.  They will never have a nuclear weapon.  Iran will never have — mark it down.  Mark it down: Iran will never have a nuclear weapon.  When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the U.N. sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy — a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.
Here at home, through Operation LeGend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat-run American cities.  It’s absolutely shocking.  When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles — Democrat-run cities — they’re a mess because they don’t get it.  Either they don’t get it or there’s something that nobody else understands.
We’ve deployed more than 1,000 additional federal agents to help these Democrat-run disasters.  We just have done this.  We have to give them a hand.  And we can stop it immediately, like a Portland would be so easy to stop.  We’d stop it immediately.
We only sent in some Homeland people — who are great, by the way — to save the courthouse, because it would have been blown up or burned down, and they did that very easily.  But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it’s Homeland, whether it’s FBI, whether it’s just law enforcement — and we’d send them in quickly.  We would eradicate it, just like happened in Minneapolis.  As soon as they were called in — they should have been called in a lot sooner; you would’ve had far less damage.
Today, we announced that Operation LeGend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already.  Bad ones.  Bad ones.  Really bad people.  Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow.  And they’ll be a very long time in prison for what they’ve done to these cities.  Most cities are well run; most of the nation is well run.  And the areas that we’re talking about are all — in all cases, run by Democrats, usually radi- — radical-left-leaning Democrats, like in New York or in Portland.
We’ve made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Memphis, and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson, and 91 murders.
We’re also using the full power of the federal government to defeat, as you know, the China virus.  New cases have declined in 80 percent of the jurisdictions in the past week.  Eighty percent.  New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak.  And other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look — because we’ve done an incredible job — but they’re having a lot of outbreaks, but they’ll be able to put them out and we put them out.
The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country 54 percent since its peak in April.  Fifty-four percent.  Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus: 92 percent of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older.  Only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred among those 44 years — think of that — 44 years and younger.  So 44 years old and younger: only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred.  And many of those people had preexisting conditions, they had problems — heart, diabetes, and other problems, but — many of those.  So, think of that: only 2.7 percent under 44 years of age.
Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33 percent higher than the United States — evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations.  South Korea — you’ve been reading about South Korea doing well.  Well, they just had a very big breakout, but they’ll be able to solve the problem.
We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk, as we know.  Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching.  We have learned one thing: There’s nothing like campus, there’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board.  It’s been proven a lot better.  It’s a lot better.  The iPads are wonderful, but you’re not going to learn the same way you do by being there.  So, nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching.
For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal few [sic] — a seasonal flu.  And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don’t talk about it in the same way, and they shouldn’t.  But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to.
Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives.  It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans.  Makes sense.
And the shutdown thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down.  You look at certain areas that — in all cases, Democrat-run — still shut down, and the numbers there aren’t even good.  But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse.  A lot of problems are being caused — probably far more, I would say, Scott, than is caused by the virus itself, now that we understand the virus.
Colleges should take reasonable precautions.  Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness.  And universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors and teachers.
The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high-risk settings — and to prevent transmission, period — but especially in nursing homes; and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.
We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country.  We have a tremendous unused testing capacity.  It’s something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us.
In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science-based approach to protecting the high risk while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work and school.  Our country will be open.  Our country is getting open quickly.  Our stock markets are almost back to where they were, prior to the China virus disaster coming in.
And I want to thank you all for being here, and we’ll take some questions.
Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-19-2020/

     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Where is Nancy Pelosi?  The House is in recess.  House and Senate Democrats left town after failing to compromise and make a deal to provide relief to the American people.  While Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues went home, this President remained hard at work.  President Trump took executive action, including stopping evictions; providing unemployment insurance; pausing student loan payments; cutting the payroll tax, which put money in the pockets of all Americans. 
     Democrats apparently were unable to stick around to make a deal.  Now, suddenly, Democrats will be rushing back to Washington.  But why?  The answer: the United States Postal Service.  It’s a stunning turn of events.  Democrats went home after accomplishing nothing: no deal on stimulus checks, no deal on small-business relief, no deal on eviction protections.  The concerns of everyday Americans were not the concerns of Democrats on Capitol Hill. 
     So where is Nancy Pelosi?  She and her Democrat colleagues will be back in Washington soon to pursue their latest manufactured crisis: the Postal Service.  Democrats denied a $10 billion offer for the U.S. Postal Service by this President before they went on recess.  But now they’re back to pursue the latest Democrat-manufactured crisis.  It’s sad, but it’s clear where Democrats’ priorities stand. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.

5:26 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  And thank you for being here.  Let me provide a brief update on the China virus, as well as our economic recovery, which is going really very well, as you probably have been hearing.
     Nearly 85 percent of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases, and that’s despite the fact that we have the number one testing program anywhere in the world.  We’re up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country.  This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6 percent; the test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5 percent, a 71 percent reduction from April and a 15 percent reduction from mid-July.  That’s a big reduction.  The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April.
     And I urge everyone to apply commonsense mitigation.  We know that.  And we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for really doing such a great job. 
     The United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined.  If you combine all of Europe, it’s less than what we do.  Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes.  Nearly 80 percent of all commercial lab test results are now returned within three days.  So we’ve gotten that number down from about eight days to three days, and that’s only in the longer-term lab cases.  But we have many 15- minute tests; we have some 5-minute tests.  The turnaround time for federal surge testing sites is just two days.  So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can’t do anything about, it’s all the way down to two days.  That’s a very substantial reduction.  Great job by the people that do it.
     We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals.  Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for nearly half of all fatalities.  That’s an incredible thing.  So it’s 1 percent of the U.S. population but they account for nearly half of the fatalities from the China virus.  That’s why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment.  And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.
     In the coming days, we’ve worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the governors — 50 governors all around the United States — and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the governors.  And I think, for the most part, they’re doing a really good job.  They’re focused very heavily on nursing homes.  And when they need equipment that they can’t get — remember, they’re supposed to get it, but when they can’t get, we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock.
     Thanks to my administration’s decisive action to save American jobs, we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history.  And that’s because the foundation that we set previously, before the virus came and hit our shore — the foundation was so strong; we had such a strong foundation that we’re recovering much faster than anybody anticipated.  It turns out that it will be a very, very strong “V,” and you’ll see that in just a second.
     So retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all-time high.  That’s not all time for this month or last month; that’s at an all-time high, and you see that with the chart.  This was previous to the — the plague, I call it — the plague coming into our land, and really affected 188 — dealing with 188 countries. 
     And if you see, we’ve not only recovered but we’re at a much higher level than we were even then.  That’s an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible.  So we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history.  That’s an amazing statement. 
     So retail spending is great, and now, if they would put up, auto production has surged 28 percent, and that’s your auto production, which is right there.  (A chart is displayed.)  So you’ll see that that’s now about even to where it was, and that was at an all-time record high, and we’re already even. 
     And if you had a chart for used cars, you’d see that used car sales are setting a record, and that’s great for production because when the used cars are practically not available — they’re very, very tight — that means you’re going to make a lot of new cars.  So that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now, but that’s a fantastic number.  That’s a number that’s the equivalent of where it was, and that was a record.
     So you see what’s happening with respect to the economy and the recovery.  And the stock market is almost at an all-time high.  In fact, NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-15-2020/

    THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much, everybody.  So we have some very interesting news.  Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey’s very corrupt FBI, is expected to plead guilty.  You probably heard that.  It just came out.  So that’s just the beginning, I would imagine, because what happened should never happen again.  So, he is pleading guilty.  Terrible thing.  Terrible thing.  The fact is they spied on my campaign and they got caught.  And you’ll be hearing more. 
    Today, the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a new report on how my administration has harnessed the full power of the Defense Production Act to achieve the greatest industrial mobilization since World War Two, in our fight against the China virus. 
    New factories, businesses, and laboratories are being built all over America to match our nation’s demand for personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, drugs, testing supplies, therapeutics, and vaccines.  It’s been incredible what we’ve been able to do in a very short period of time.  We’re helping other countries also because we’ve been really — we’ve been doing it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. 
    It was just announced, a little while ago, industrial production rose for the third straight month.  It’s a big thing.  Factory output was up 3.4 percent this month after a 5.7 increase last month.  Those are getting to be record numbers.  And manufacturing capacity utilization is now up to almost 70 percent.  So we’re coming back very strong.  We should have a very good third quarter.  We should have an unbelievably good next year.  Next year, if we don’t mess it up with somebody that has no idea what they’re doing, could be a fantastic year.
    My administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act to a number — and related authorities — at a — 78 times, dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials.  So, put it a little bit differently: The administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act and related authorities 78 times.  That’s a lot, Peter, right?  It’s a big number: 78 times.  It came in very handy.  A lot of times we just mentioned it and they did what we asked them to do.  Dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials. 
    I’ve used the DPA more comprehensively than any President in history.  There was a time when the media would say, “Why aren’t you using it?  Why aren’t you using it?”  Well, we have used it a lot, where necessary.  Only where necessary.  For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation. 
    By invoking the DPA, we mobilized the extraordinary productive might of General Motors to manufacture ventilators.  GM repurposed the Kokomo, Indiana, plant in just 17 days — an all-time record — and has now produced over 21,000 ventilators. 
    We’re also working with Ford Motor Company and General Electric to produce over 30,000 ventilators a month in Michigan.  They’ve done a great job.  Our nation is now the king of ventilators.  I say that: the king of ventilators.  We’re sending them all over the world and helping a lot of countries that could never have ventilators.  And it’s — really, I guess we’re looking to produce over 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year.  Those are some numbers.  So we’re helping a lot of countries. 
    In April, I directed 3M to increase its manufacturing of N95 masks.  By May, they had increased production by over a million masks a day.  Think of that: They increased production of masks by over one million a day.  3M is now manufacturing an additional 39 million masks a month.  We also worked with Honeywell to open factories in Arizona and Rhode Island.  They’re now producing over 20 million masks a month. 
    By the end of the year, domestic U.S. manufacturing will have produced over 1 billion N95 respirators, and all of them are made right here in the USA.  That’s a big difference from the past.
    Overall, we’ve increased N95 mask production by 400 million masks a year.  Now, the media might say, “Why not 500?  Why not 600?”  Nobody has seen numbers like this ever.
    We delivered more than $75 million in support to Puritan Medical in Maine.  I was up there.  I was — as you remember, we had a tremendous visit and tremendous throngs of people along the roads on the way to Puritan Medical.  Puritan has a doubled their production of testing swabs from 20 million to 40 million per month.  They’re doing a fantastic job, and so is Maine.
    I’ve also used the DPA to fight price gouging and hoarding.  My administration located and seized over half a million pieces of hoarded personal protective equipment, including 299,000 pairs of medical-grade gloves, 192,000 N95 respirators, and 130,000 surgical masks.  That’s hoarding.
    My administration’s decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results.  People have done an incredible job.  We’ve replenished the Strategic National Stockpile that was very badly depleted when we took office and totally neglected in the last administration.
    Since the start of the pandemic, we have tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to over 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to over 15 million, and quadrupled the number of ventilators to 69,000.
    By September, the Strategic National Stockpile inventory is on track to contain over 300,000 — excuse me, 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks, over 4.5 billion gloves, and over 190,000 ventilators.  That’s far more than we’ve done before.  It’s not even close. 
    As we talk about the economy, we continue to restore America’s industrial might.  We’re bringing jobs to the USA.  We understand that the economic health is critical — very critical to public health.  We’ll be discussing next week some of the outstanding numbers we have, compared to any other country.  There is no country even close when you look at what we’ve done compared to them on the stand- — from the standpoint of the economy and also during — even during the period of the China virus.
    In the last three months, we’ve added an average of 100,000 jobs every single day.  We’ve also added over 620,000 manufacturing jobs in the past three months.  That’s despite people saying, “You can’t do manufacturing jobs anymore.”  You’d “need a magic wand,” they said, but they were wrong.  Weekly jobless claims just fell below 1 million for the first time in a long time. 
    I’m pleased to announce that as part of Operation Warp Speed, the federal government will be partnering with McKesson Corporation — great company, which is a major medical supplier — to rapidly distribute a China-virus vaccine as soon as one is approved — fully approved.  They’re in stage three trials.  We have many of them going along different passes.  Also many different companies doing them — very, very incredible companies.
    We currently have three candidates in phase three clinical trials and are on pace to have more than 100 million doses of a vaccine ready before the end of the year and 500 million doses very shortly thereafter.  And we’re ready, logistically, to distribute them.  Our military is ready.  We have a great general who’s in charge.  That’s what he does, is he distributes things — usually it’s people and weapons, tanks — but in this case, it’s a vaccine or a therapeutic, as it may be.
    We continue to actively monitor the virus, executing our strategy to protect the vulnerable and prevent hospital overcrowding.  As of today, hospitalizations continue to be very stable, and we will be watching always very carefully.  Remain vigilant.
    We ask every citizen to practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask when distancing is not possible, and to protect the elderly.  Always protect the elderly.
    So now we’ll take a few questions if you’d like.
    John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-14-2020/

5:27 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everyone.  Thank you very much.  It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they’ve caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro — horribly shot — a young man, wonderful young man.  And we have just — this just came out two minutes ago.  So, Attorney General Barr just announced.
As you know, we named Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, where we’re going to be helping out, and are in the process of helping out, cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime — in particular, certain types of crime.  So that’s really good news.  They caught the killer of LeGend.
Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people.  That’s what it is.  At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.
Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans.  You know that.  He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early.
If he had followed — if we went after — I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died.  This is according to many people.  I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that.  He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.
Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every U.S. community based on his policies.  He wants to have ridiculous open borders.  I’ve been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that if you have open borders, you don’t have a country.  You don’t have a country, with open borders.  So he wants open borders.  The Democrats want open borders.
And if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through.  The wall is getting close to 290 miles long, and it’s having a huge impact.  So we disagree with him on that.  That’s one of the many different — many things that we disagree with.
But while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens.
He wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months — I guess this just happened; he thinks it’s good politics, I guess — no matter where they live and no matter their surroundings.  Because different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem.
He does not identify what authority the President has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed.
Also, many of our 50 states are doing the job at a level that frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice.  So I want to just say our governors have worked very hard.  They’ve worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that’s been going.
We have Scott now involved.  And so, Scott, congratulations.  You’ll be working with a lot of governors; you’ve already started.  And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.
If the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have?  That’s why he refused — Biden — to take questions.  He couldn’t answer any of them.  Couldn’t answer the questions.  He refuses to take questions.  He never takes questions.  I take questions; he never takes questions.  And you sort of wonder what’s going on, because they’re not that difficult.  Some can be nasty, but they’re not that difficult.  But he never takes questions.  So he just, I guess, left.  I didn’t see it, but I guess he just left the podium.  Put it in your minds.
My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks.  And I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do.  Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good.  Maybe they’re not so good.  But frankly, what do you have to lose?  You have nothing to lose.  So we do, and we’ve been saying wear them when it’s appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing, if you can’t distance enough.  And what do you have to lose?
But again, it’s up to the governors.  And we want to have a certain freedom.  We want to have a certain freedom.  That’s what we’re about.
At the same time, we also understand that each state is different and is facing unique circumstances.  You have very, very different states facing very unique differences and circumstances.
We’ve entrusted the governors of each state, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies, following guidance from the federal government and CDC.  We’re working with each state to implement a plan based on the facts and science.  We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the federal government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal.
Americans must have their freedoms.  And I trust the American people and their governors very much.  I trust the American people.  And the governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions, and Joe doesn’t.  Joe doesn’t.  Joe doesn’t know too much.
Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science.  That’s why we’re focused on protecting the high-risk Americans.  That is why we’re delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate.  And that is why we’re developing a vaccine and therapeutics in record time.  You’ll see that, I think, very soon.
Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to.  I think I can speak for you.  We’ve been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks.  But he wants them in the basement for months on end.
And you have governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their — wherever they may be — apartments.  And frankly, I don’t think the results are necessarily better than other results.  But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools, and grind society to a halt.  And he wants it done by a federal decree.  This would lead to a crippling long — long-lasting depression.  This would be a crippling long-lasting depression.
And yesterday, I showed you the numbers about how well we’re doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed.  And we’re back and very strong.  It’s a very strong “V.”  It’s almost a straight-up “V.”  We’ll be discussing that over the next couple of days.
But the economy is coming back, and the employment numbers over the last three months are a record in history of our country.  And we’ll be back next year.  I think we’ll be maybe even stronger than the previous years, where we set every record in the book: unemployment and stock market.
By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record.  And NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-13-2020/

509,Trump,2020-08-13 08:30:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany | 8/13/2020,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:30 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This is a historic day, and I have here with me Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, Ambassador Robert O’Brien.  They’re going to summarize the history that was made today and take a few of your questions.  We also have Special Representative Avi Berkowitz here; and Special Envoy to Iran, Brian Hook, who will be in attendance. 
     MR. KUSHNER:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  And thank you all for being here. 
     I want to start today by congratulating the people of Israel and the people of the United Arab Emirates.  Today is a historic breakthrough and a great day for peace. 
     I also want to congratulate President Trump on this milestone.  He worked very hard on this with his team.  We worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, who really are two visionary leaders who made a big step forward today to really change the region. 
     The last time we had an agreement like this in the region was 1994, when Israel made an agreement with the Kingdom of Jordan, which stopped aggression and helped bring forward peace. 
     Over the last 26 years, there’s been a lot of developments in the region — some positive, but many that have set the region back, and it has led to lots of lives being lost, lots of opportunity and hope being destroyed, and — and a region that really has had a lot of problems.
     When President Trump came into office, we had a caliphate for ISIS in the Middle East, which was the size of Ohio.  We had a lot of instability.  Iran’s aggression was being felt all throughout the region.  A lot of their proxies were very well funded and causing instability in Yemen and in Syria and in other places. 
     And now we’re in a position where we’ve been able to work with our allies.  A lot of our allies felt abandoned.  President Trump has been able to rebuild those relationships.  His first trip as President was to Saudi Arabia in May of 2017, where he laid out the problems that were facing the region and very clearly articulated that, in order to make progress, we’d all have to work together around common goals and we’d have to acknowledge historic differences and historic conflicts.  But we can’t let those conflicts hold us back. 
     President Trump’s leadership, the ability to build the relationships with the leaders in the region — people were modernizing their society and realizing that we needed a new paradigm.
     On President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, we made an agreement with a lot of these countries that we’re going to start a counterterror finance center.  And since then, we’ve worked to limit the amount of funding that’s gone to extremist groups. 
     We worked with Saudi Arabia, which is the custodian of the two holy sites, and we worked with them to do a counter center, a counter-extremism center to combat online extremism, and that’s made a big difference because you can’t solve the short-term problem without taking on the long-term fight.  We’ve seen Saudi Arabia make a lot of modernizations over the last years, giving more rights to women and taking steps in the right direction, which have been very positive.  And now today’s breakthrough really allows us to go forward. 
     To give you a little bit of background on this deal, this is something that’s been in discussions now for over a year and a half.  We were talking with Israel; we were talking with United Arab Emirates about moving forward.  Obviously, because of the Israeli elections and because of some other things that were happening in the region, this is something that was talked about but never really got to the right place for it to happen.
     As you know, with deals, deals happen when deals are ready.  And peace deals are very rare and very historic, and there’s a lot of reasons why people would be held back from moving forward. 
     What we saw was when the President rolled out his vision for peace, which we worked very hard on for a couple of years to really try to understand the issues in the region between the Israelis and Palestinians, he put forward 180 pages of detail on how we can address the issues of the past but also figure out how to move forward. 
     During that acknowledgement, President Trump was able to get Israel to agree to have a two-state solution with the Palestinians and, for the first time in history, to agree to a map that outlined the territory that they would be willing to work with in order to see that happen.  That showed a lot of people in the region that Israel was serious about really moving forward and making peace and also showed them that President Trump’s leadership and diplomacy could make things happen that hadn’t happened previously. 
     What happened is, as Israel was discussing with us providing — taking Israeli law and sovereignty to areas of the West Bank and applying it, we were having these discussions.  And over the last six weeks, the discussions between UAE and Israel started accelerating around this being a potential different path. 
     We all saw Ambassador Otaiba’s op-ed that came out that said that he thought applying Israeli sovereignty to this — to these areas would be detrimental to the region.  And a new course, a new option was created that was discussed that ultimately both countries thought was a much more viable option to go forward. 
     Israel has agreed to suspend those efforts at this time.  And as a result, we’re going to focus on bringing these two countries together.  This is really a historic breakthrough, and it shows that President Trump’s leadership, from the Riyadh speech until today — you see a much different Middle East than what he inherited.  And hopefully, there’s a lot more good things to come. 
     This is an icebreaker between these two countries.  This is the first Arab country to normalize relations with Israel in a long time — 26 years since Jordan.  And what we’re going to hopefully see from there is more countries start to do the same. 
     The final thing I’ll just say is that, here in America, the biggest threat that we saw in the last campaign was really two things.  One was ISIS.  The caliphate was growing, we were seeing journalists being beheaded, we were seeing people burnt in cages, and the threat of ISIS was something that was very scary to a lot of Americans and needed to be stopped.  The instability was providing a place for extremists to plan attacks, to plan all kinds of terrible things, and the extremists were trying to radicalize the next generation. 
     One of the biggest excuses that extremists use to radicalize the next generation is the mosque and — the Al-Aqsa Mosque — and saying that it’s being threatened and the fact that Muslims aren’t able to pray there.  This deal will allow for flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv, which will allow Muslims a real entrée to come and visit Israel peacefully and to come and pray at the mosque with whatever frequency they deem appropriate. 
     This is a big breakthrough.  As people go there and pray and see that this is available, they’ll share it with their friends and they’ll share the experiences, they’ll share pictures of it on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter, and people throughout the world will see that the mosque is safe and that — that all people are welcome there. 
     So this is a really great step forward for the region, a great step forward for the country, and a great step forward for the world.  And again, I just want to really compliment the three leaders who worked very hard to make this possible: Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, and President Trump here in America. 
     Thank you.
     MR. O’BRIEN:  So, thank you to Jared for that summary.  And it’s — it’s been extraordinary work by a number of fine diplomats, working under President Trump’s leadership, to arrive at today’s outcome.  Jared Kushner has been at the forefront of those efforts.   Avi, Brian Hook, and others have — have put in just — just tremendous work, under the President’s direction, to get where we are here today.
     And I know, Jared, you’re not a — you don’t have a diplomat-title or ambassador title, but we don’t have the finer ambassador, especially in the region, than Advisor Kushner.  So thank you for those — those remarks and for the really incredible effort. 
     I want to start by congratulating, today, the President of the United States; the Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu; and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  This is a remarkable achievement, and they’ve been — the achievement is now — will now be known in history as the “Abraham Accords,” or the “Ibrahim Accords” in the Muslim countries, or the “Avraham Accords” in Israel. 
     It’s something very special.  It’s something that doesn’t happen very often.  Very few of my predecessors, as National Security Advisor, have been able to come to this podium to announce a peace deal in the Middle East.  It’s a — it’s a very rare thing.
     As I said earlier in the Oval Office today, the President is going to be known in history as one of the change makers and one of the remarkable leaders in the Middle East.  And that’s not something that you may have thought of when he came into office.  But one of his very first steps was repairing our relationship with Israel, which had been badly damaged, especially in the last month of the prior administration. 
     The President did something that was unheard of.  Many presidential candidates, going back two decades, had promised that if they were elected, they would move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  President Trump had the courage to do it, and he developed wonderful credibility and a reservoir of goodwill in Israel. 
     He recognized the Golan Heights as being Israeli territory, and — and took those away from a very — what could have been a very destabilized situation that we’ve seen develop in Syria. 
     He destroyed the physical caliphate of ISIS, which, Jared had said, was the size of Ohio.  It was — it stretched across the Middle East, and terror reigned because of the caliphate.
     He brought justice to al-Baghdadi, who had killed so many Americans: Sotloff and Mueller and Kassig and Foley. 
     He put maximum pressure on Iran and — and cut off much of the terrorist funding that was going to the proxy wars in Yemen, in Hezbollah, in Lebanon, in Syria, and throughout the region. 
     And today, we have the — the Abraham Accords.  He’s brought peace to the Middle East, at least peace between the UAE and Israel.  And what I have said is the President is often known as the greatest dealmaker, and he wrote the book “The Art of the Deal.”  And he’s considered a great, great dealmaker, which he is. 
     But I think history is going to remember the President for being a great peacemaker.  He brought peace to Israel and the UAE.  He has signed a — his diplomat signed a historic accord in Afghanistan.  I want to remind people that we haven’t had an American casualty in combat in Afghanistan since February 29th.
     He used his offices and his — his pressure to stop Idlib from being overrun in Syria, and brought a ceasefire agreement when — when Turkey had invaded Northern Syria. 
     A lot of people said that when he came into office that there would be war in North Korea.  But through personal diplomacy, he’s — has kept that situation from — from turning into a kinetic event.
     So, it’s really remarkable, I think, when you — when you step back and take a look at what this President has done on the peace front.  And it wouldn’t surprise me — it’ll take some time in this environment — but it wouldn’t surprise me if the President is eventually nominated for a Nobel Prize for the — this — today’s work is an example of why he would be rightly considered and should be a frontrunner for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
     So, I also want to compliment the courageousness of Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince.  You know, there have been two other great Arab leaders — King Hussein — in my lifetime, King Hussein and Anwar Sadat — who have made peace with Israel.  And now, Mohammed bin Zayed enters that pantheon of great, courageous Arab leaders. 
     And I want to compliment President — Prime Minister Netanyahu, in Israel, who was under tremendous pressure to extend Israeli law and sovereignty to portions of the country, but is — has stepped up against that political pressure to make peace.  Something that may have been politically popular, but he put the interest of his country and his people first.
     And so I think we’ve got some very courageous leaders that worked with the President to come to today’s tremendous historical accord. 
     Stepping back from — what does this mean beyond the historic idea of a major Arab country making peace with Israel all these years after 1948?  It makes sense on so many different levels.  The UAE and Israel are both capable security partners of the United States, and close — close partners of ours in the region, standing up to Iran, standing up to Islamic extremism.  They’ll — them — the peace agreement between these two countries will encourage and foster cooperation in those efforts. 
     These are very innovative countries.  Israel is called the “startup nation.”  And for those of you who have been there, it’s — you feel like you’re driving through Palo Alto through half the country.  The UAE is also a very innovative country.  Putting those two nations together is going to create a dynamic of innovation and creativity in the region.  And they — both countries are populated by incredibly dynamic people. 
     There are tremendous opportunities that are going to arise from this agreement.  Jared talked about the idea of Arab pilgrims and Muslim pilgrims going to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, going up to the Mount, and having the opportunity to pray in peace in Israel. 
     The — as you know, the President has made religious freedom, especially religious freedom in the Middle East, a center point — a centerpiece of his foreign policy.  And this is a great step towards fulfilling the idea that the three great faiths that came from the Holy City — Christianity, Judaism, and Islam — will be able to pray and interact peaceably together in that beautiful city of Jerusalem.
     Tourism, with — Abu Dhabi and Dubai and the other Emirates have become meccas for tourism, especially before the Chinese virus — the COVID virus.  Israel is a great land for tourism.  That’ll expand trade between the UAE and Israel, which both have incredible economies.  And again, as we — as we recover from COVID, this agreement will help the economies of those countries and the countries in the region expand.  And I think you’re going to see an increase in jobs in all three countries as a result of these accords.
     With respect to the peace process overall, we’ve got a great team.  That team is going to be fanning out.  We’re going to be on the — working the phones.  We’re going to be in the region.  And we believe that there are other countries waiting in the wings that are going to watch and see how the — the tremendous response to the courage of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Crown Prince have been received by their people and by the world.  And, I mean, I’ve — I’ve already been on the phone with a number of European counterparts who have called to congratulate us for our role in — in this accord but who are — some of whom were astounded that this took place.
     And we also think that this could lead to a great deal for the Palestinian people, that — it’s a people that the President of the United States, President Trump, has not forgotten.  And he’s — he’s endorsed the two-state solution.  He wants to see the Palestinian people in a prosperous country of their own.  And the groundwork has been laid for that, so I think we’ll be working very hard on those efforts in the — in the coming months and — and year.
     So, again, today is a great day.  It’s a great day for the people of the UAE, it’s a great day for the people of Israel, for their leaders.  And it’s also a great day for the United States of America as we played a role that we’ve traditionally played throughout the world, in coming in to mediate in difficult situations and — and achieve peace and achieve prosperity for our friends and neighbors.
     And again, I’m honored to be a part of the President’s team on this.  And again, I’ll end with congratulations to the President for his leadership, and again, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  Thank you very much.
     MR. KUSHNER:  We’ll start with Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-13-2020/

5:56 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate you being here, and good evening.  As we continue to confront the China virus, we’re rebuilding America’s economy like nobody thought possible, actually.  We’re doing incredibly well.
The stock market is up almost 300 points again today.  While our economy is performing significantly better than Europe — which people have to understand very strongly; it’s performing better than any market anywhere in the world actually.  At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40 percent higher excess mortality than the United States.  And I will say that that’s a significant number.  We’re working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way.
We’re doing very well, as you know, on the vaccines and the therapeutics.  But think of that: We have the strongest economy — performing economy in the world.  We’re up — I think it’s $9 trillion since March — $9 trillion in value.  That’s a — that’s a number that nobody has ever heard of before.  We’re also getting close to about a 50 percent number since March, which is incredible.  So, it’s $9 trillion.  It’s almost 50 percent.  In fact, I think it went above 50 percent today with the 300 point increase.  And it’s — so we’re doing much better than Europe, significantly.  And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40 percent higher excess mortality than the United States.
I just want to mention because another number of judges were approved recently.  We’ll be, probably, over 300 judges –federal judges, including court of appeals judges — approved by the end of my first term.  And other than they — when they added new judges into somebody’s term, which happens seldom, but we have more than any — this is a record.  Nobody has ever seen anything like this in one term.  So we’re going to have over 300 federal judges, and that’s court of appeals judges, and that’s just in the first term.  It’s — probably we’ll finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing.
The stock market’s rebound signals a “V”-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world — stronger.  If you look, you’ll see exactly what we have.  We — we lead the world.  Japan is second.  But in terms of dollar value, it’s not even close.  So there it is.  A lot of great competitors: Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong.  The United States is leading the world, very substantially.
On the second slide, you’ll see the virus-induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations.  And you see that, right there; there’s the United States.  And that’s despite the fact that we’ve done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we’ve done more, by far, ventilators.  We’re building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we’re distributing them all over the world.  We’re helping other countries.
But despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal.  I’m sure you’d love to put them in your various media outlets.  I know you want to get that out.  If you want to leave the room early and do that, that would be fine.  The rapid recovery — but it would be nice to report it.
The rapid recovery of homebuilders’ sentiment points to massive new construction.  And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes, and that’s because people have tremendous confidence.  This is where we went, and the housing market has quickly rebounded.  We were at a record, and now we’re going to be at a record again very shortly.  Those numbers are incredible.  That’s where we are.  And we had to turn off the economy, and now we’re turning it back on, and that’s beyond a “V” shape.  This is going to be very strong; it’s called a “strong ‘V.’”
Automobile demand has increased 65 percent over the last three months.  Sixty-five percent automobile demand.  And we’re anticipating that that’s going to go up even further, but that’s more than any — anybody else.  The manufacturing sector — remember “manufacturing is dead,” according to the past administration of Obama and Biden?  “Manufacturing is dead. You’d need a magic wand.”  Well, you don’t need a magic wand.  You need competence and capability.  The manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at the highest reading since October of ’18, which is — was a — an extraordinary period of time.  And there we are.  That’s pretty good.
These are numbers that nobody has seen until just recently, and now they’re just coming out.  These are numbers that are leading — I guess, the stock market people, they’re very smart people.  I know many of them, and they’re seeing things that they don’t even believe.  So, the manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at its highest reading in a long, long time.
The economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last three years — a record, by far — and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted.  So, there you are.  You look at that, and that’s a record, and it’s a record for the quarter.  We had over 9 million — substantially more than 9 million jobs.
So those are incredible numbers about our economy and how it’s coming back.  It’s coming back very strongly, and it’s coming back at a level that’s far greater than anybody anticipated.  And we’re very proud of that.  And I give a lot of credit to all of our people — Steve and Larry.
And we’ll be talking about it.  If you have any questions on it — shouldn’t have any questions.  I didn’t — I didn’t print those charts.  Who did?  The economy (inaudible), let’s see.  I don’t know.  We’ll find that out for you, but it wasn’t us.  We took those — we took those numbers from somebody.  Where did you get those numbers, Larry?  They’re from where?
MR. KUDLOW: It’s from the BLS jobs report (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  BLS jobs report.
MR. KUDLOW:  The monthly jobs report, through July.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Everybody has that — everybody who needs?
The Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical leftwing agenda that the country doesn’t want and won’t accept.
For example, they’ve asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion — that’s billion — $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption.  You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race.  They should do that race over, by the way.  I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race.  When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner.  So, her opponent — I don’t know what’s happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy.
And then you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened.  And they admitted they made a mistake.  And many were sent to dead people and many were sent to — a number was sent — I guess, two — that at least two, three, four were sent to dogs.  One was sent to a cat.  They’re sent all over the place.  That was in Virginia.
In Paterson, New Jersey, they had a massive amount of voter fraud.  And it’s been a disaster.  Paterson, New Jersey has been total disaster — that’s universal mail-in voting.
So, they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country, where you have hundreds of millions of voters.  They can’t do a little race with 20,000 people; now they want to take it countrywide.  Mail-in voting — it’s going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections.  When you always talk about “Russia, Russia, Russia,” China, Iran on voting — your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran.  Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats.
But now the Democrats — they want $3.5 billion, think of it.  But now that they’re unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money — of course, we would never approve an amount like that.  And they also want $25 billion additional for the Post Office, Steve.  Twenty-five billion for the Post Office, so the Post Office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent, at random, all over the place.  They have no idea where they’re going.
So, they want $25 billion, and they want — think of this: They want $3.5 billion.  Would you say that’s enough to cover it?  I think we could do it for less, right?  I think we could do it for less.  But they want $25 billion for the Post Office because of this.
And remember, the new man — who is a great person, a great businessman — he just got there a little while ago.  The Post Office has been run poorly for many, many decades.  Great people in the Post Office, incredible people, but they’ve had very bad leadership for many years.  So, we’ll get it straightened out.
But they turned down this bill because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve.  So, they want $25 billion for the Post Office.  They want $2.5- or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in — $3.5 billion.  And the bill is not going to happen because they don’t even want to talk about it because we can’t give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus.  It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they’re asking for.  So, therefore, they don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting.  So, therefore, they can’t do it, I guess.  Right?
Are they going to do it even though they don’t have the money?  They’re asking for the $3.5 billion.  They’re asking for $25 billion for the Post Office so they can do this, I guess, and other things.  At $25 [billion], I would hope it would be a lot of other things, too.
But, therefore, they don’t have it.  They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in votes.  It’ll be the greatest rigged election in history.  It’ll be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated, other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign — President Obama, Biden, and everybody else.  And they got caught.  Let’s see what happens.  This will be one of the greatest frauds in history.
So they’re admitting that they want $3.5 billion, and they’re not going to do a deal that’s good for the American people.  Therefore, they’re not going to get the $3.5 billion.  Therefore, they can’t do the universal mail-in vote.  It’s very simple.  How are they going to do it if they don’t have the money to do it?
The Democrats are also holding up money for schools, and hospitals, and small businesses, and state and local governments.  They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action.  And I did executive orders, which are now in full force in effect, and they’re going forward.
I signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus.  That’s $400 more than the Democrats have provided.  Remember that: That’s $400 more than the Democrats have provided.
Nancy and Chuck haven’t provided anything.  And remember this: President Obama, when we had a problem — a pretty big problem; a very big problem — you know what he gave?  Twenty-five dollars.  He gave 25 bucks.  So now they say, “Well, we want to give $500 or we want to give $600.”  They don’t want to give.  They don’t even give anything.  They’re not doing anything.
But President Obama and Biden — Sleepy Joe — gave $25.  Twenty-five.  And they’ll complain, “Oh, we want to give more.”  Well, we’re giving $400, and that’s now in the works, and that’ll be getting out to the people soon, Steve.  Okay?  Remember that: $25 is what they gave the last time.  Twenty-five.
I want to make it unmistakably clear that I’m protecting people from evictions.  They didn’t want to do that.  The Democrats didn’t want to do a protection from evictions — people getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the “China virus,” whatever you want to call it.  We have 20 — now we’re up to 21 different names.  All we know is it came out of China, and it shouldn’t have.  They should have stopped it.
Under my executive order, HUD, HHS, and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes.  They’re not going to be evicted.  They are not going to be evicted.  And those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you’ll make sure of that.
I’m providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020.  That’s a tremendous amount of money that’s being supplied and given to families.  Tremendous.
The Democrats didn’t want to do a payroll tax.  They thought it was “too much money,” I guess, or it would make businesses too successful.  They don’t want to see success.  They certainly don’t want to see it before the election.  They certainly don’t want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there.  They don’t.  Because they say they can’t win with that kind of success.  They can’t win.  They have to get used to it.
Remember: We’ve already gotten $3 trillion in stimulus, so they should have probably negotiated a little bit differently.  Maybe they should have asked for all of this before they got most of the money and we gave it out — a lot of it to the people.
When we win the election — when I win the election, I’m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape, or form hurting Social Security.  That money is going to come from the General Fund.  We’re not going to touch Social Security.  I said from day one that we’re going to protect Social Security, and we’re going to protect our people.  And Social Security is one of the things that will be protected.  Pre-existing conditions will be protected.  Medicare will be protected.
But Social Security will be totally protected under me.  Under them, it will not be protected because we will have a stock market crash the likes of which you’ve never seen.  Your taxes will be doubled and tripled.  And your regulations will go through the roof, which is what was causing the problems with the country in the first place.
Student loans: I signed a directive providing relief to student borrowers.  Not their fault that they can’t go to college.  I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.  So we’re going to take care of our students.  We have a lot of great students out there, and they — they got hit like everybody else.  So I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.
And the payroll tax — we’ll be terminating the payroll tax after I, hopefully, get elected.  We’ll be terminating the payroll tax, so that will mean anywhere from $5,000 to even more per family, and also great for businesses and great for jobs.  A lot of people will be very happy to hear that.  A lot of the great — certainly, conservative economists will be great to have — they think that’s the greatest thing we can do.  That’s better than the payments; that’s better than anything else.
But it’s a lot of money, and it’s — it’s going right directly to the people, and it goes there very easily.  But it also creates stronger companies to employ the people.  So we will be — on the assumption I win, we are going to be terminating the payroll tax after the beginning of the new year.
Today, I met with parents, students, teachers, and health experts to discuss the vital importance of safety and safely reopening America’s schools.  This evening, I’ll outline the commonsense recommendations that should guide schools as they reopen with precautions.  We want to be very, very safe and very careful — so, precautions in place.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide as we race toward the competition — and the completion — we’re competing with us, but I’m not completing — competing with anyone.  We just want to have a vaccine.  We have — we’re dealing with other countries, and we want them to do well.  We’re giving them whatever information they need.  We’re all working towards something that will happen.  It will happen before the end of the year — maybe substantially before, but before the end of the year.  And therapeutics will happen, likewise, even sooner.
But we’re looking for that responsible path forward to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to resume work and school and play football.  Go play football.
I spoke to some of the great football players — college players — Trevor and a lot of great players.  Called Coach — a coach called “Coach O.”  A lot of fantastic people I got to speak to — athletes, leaders.  They want to play football.  Let them play.  Let them play.  And they’ll — they feel safer in the field than they do walking around and doing nothing.
So, hopefully, that will happen.  And hopefully, when they play football, they will proudly stand for the National Anthem and they will proudly stand and — and respect the American flag — or at least I’m not watching.  I can’t speak for others, but based on what I see now and based on what I’m looking at, with respect to the NBA at this point, a lot of people agree with me.  So we want people — we would like to request people — you stand proudly for the flag and for the National Anthem.
In the months since the virus arrived, we’ve learned a great deal.  While this is a dangerous and highly infectious disease, it primarily affects the oldest segment of our population or those with chronic health issues.
The United States has the largest nursing home and assisted-living home population in the Western world, by far.  Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The median age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old.  These findings underscore that all Americans must continue to apply extreme vigilance in protecting our elderly population and those with chronic conditions.  Outcomes are very different for younger Americans without serious health issues — tremendously different.  They can often expect mild or moderate symptoms or even no symptoms whatsoever.  They have very strong immune systems, we’ve learned — even more so than we ever thought.
In a typical year, approximately five times as many Americans under the age of 65 die from heart disease as have so far been lost to the coronavirus from the same age group.  That’s an interesting statistic.
Bless- — blessedly, children appear to face the lowest risk of all.  It’s 99.995 percent of all fatilities [fatalities] are adults.  Think of that: 99.95.  That is extremely close to 100 percent of all fatilities [fatalities] are adults.
Children often have only mild symptoms, and medical complications are incredibly rare — very, very, very rare.  Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions.  In each of the last five years, the flu resulted in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to coronavirus, by far.  The flu — the flu does kill young people.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and protect students.  All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstances.  This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at a high risk.
And one of the things we’d like to do is when we make payment to schools — because we spend a lot of money on schools — we’d like to make the payment directly to the student or to the child.  And that would be to the parents, essentially, but to the child.  We want to follow the child so that if a school is closed, the family can go to another school, maybe in another area, but they can do it.  And we’d like to make that payment — rather than paying a school that’s closed, we’d rather pay directly.  We’re following the child — where the child goes.  And we want to pay the family, pay the child, and then the family can take care of the cost.
And we’re trying to get that approved too, but the Democrats don’t like doing anything, unless it means doing for the union, which controls Nancy and controls Chuck 100 percent.  And I have nothing wrong with the union.  I have great respect, more than — very few people do I respect more than a great teacher.  That’s a tremendous talent.  They — they’re really underappreciated.  These are phenomenal people with tremendous talent — the great ones are among the most important people we have in this country.
But — and they’ll be great at other — they’ll be great at charter schools.  And they’ll be great at — well, we talk about school choice, which we’d like to see so that parents can take their children to the school of their choice.  That’s something we want.  We think it’s very important, especially in the minority communities.  They want it so badly.  African American, Hispanic American, Asian American — they want it so badly.
But the two people I mentioned, Nancy and Chuck, they’re totally controlled by the heads of the union.  I think the teachers like us a lot.  We’re taking care of our teachers.  We want to take care of our teachers.
But we cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional, and academic development, and inflicting long-term, lasting damage.
I heard a gentleman today, a great person — some of you were at that meeting — from Harvard, say that every year is $10,000.  It’s a — people — they lose a tremendous amount of money in the future.  He mentioned $10,000.  And I think he was talking about on a yearly basis.  They lose a lot by every year of education that they lost.  Every year they gain, they gain $10,000.  And when you have students sitting at home, playing with a computer, it’s not the same.  That’s one thing we’ve learned for sure: It’s not the same.  It can never be the same as being in a classroom.  So we want to get our students in the classroom.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommendation that schools reopen.  They said, “Reopen.”  It said, quote, “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits.”  The doctors, also warned about the risk of increased abuse, substance use, depression, and suicide.  Suicide.
The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.”  So when you sit at home in a basement, looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away.  We have a lot of good experience at that, just by taking a look at what’s happening in politics.
Studies estimate that school closures last spring caused the average student to fall 50 percent behind in math and roughly 35 percent in reading compared to a typical year.  Think of that: It caused the average student to fall 50 percent behind in math and 35 percent in reading, compared to being at the school, being with your teachers, being in a classroom.  We’ve learned that.  We’ve learned that learning from a laptop is not great.
And, frankly, we’ve also learned that telehealth — a little unrelated, but it’s up 35,000 percent, and it’s been incredible — 35,000 percent.  We’ll check that number later, but that’s an incredible — but it is, people staying home.  And the telehealth — that has been a tremendous success.
We’ve learned those two things during this period of time with the — with the plague — with the plague coming in.  And those are two things we know.
School closures harm low-income students the most because they have less access to high-quality remote learning — they don’t have computers — and less resources for academic support.
All schools should be making plans to resume in-person classes as soon as possible.  To support the reopening of America’s schools, we provided $13 billion in elementary and secondary schools toward the CARES Act and CARES Act funding — we’re giving CARES Act funding — the vast majority of which remain available for states to use.  So, a tremendous amount of money: $13 billion.  That’s the CARES Act funding and we’re giving a large portion of that for states to use.
Today, I’m pleased to announce that we will provide up to $125 million reusable masks to various school districts all around the country.
My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen.
Finally, today my administration is highlighting general recommendations for all schools and guidance to protect high-risk teachers and students.  We’re working very, very closely with many of the schools and school districts throughout the country.
They include the following:


To ensure all students, teachers, and staff understand the symptoms of the China virus.
Require all students, teachers, and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school.
Encourage frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing during the school day, beginning upon entrance to school, and ensuring that hand-washing facilities are widely available throughout the school.  And, for the most part, schools have been very good at that.
Minimize large indoor gatherings.  Hold large gatherings outdoors whenever possible.
Maintain high standards of hygiene and ventilation within the classrooms, including keeping windows and doors open whenever possible, and running fans and air conditioning units whenever possible.
Require students, teachers, and staff to socially distance around high-risk individuals and socially distance whenever possible in any event.
Encourage the use of masks when social distancing is not possible.
Post instructions regarding hygiene and social distancing all over the school and all around the school.


We encourage schools to adopt these measures.  We’ve been working with so many of them.  And, to the best of my knowledge, virtually every one of them agrees to do that.
While we’re also providing high-risk teachers and students options to engage in distance teaching or learning, we’re working on that also.  College-age students also continue to be one of the lowest-risk demographics.  More than 99.8 percent of the deaths from this horrible disease — “the invisible enemy,” we call it — occur in people over 24 years of age.  Think of that: 99.8 percent occur in people over 24 years of age.
For this reason, it could be safer for them to live at a school rather than live with their older parents or grandparents.  They got to go to school.  We got to open up.  We got to open up our schools and open up our businesses.  And a lot of it has been open, but we can do better.
As we move forward, the number of cases is not, by any means, the most important metric to focus on because the fact is we have more cases because we have far more testing than any country in the world.  There’s no country that’s even close.
We’ve done more testing and better testing than any country.  And many of these countries that the media was putting up as a shining example of success, they’re, right now, in massive outbreaks.  You see what’s going on in many of the countries that you constantly mention.
Far more important is who the virus is infecting.  That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require hospitalization or result in death — those that afflict the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions — all the while acting to prevent hospital overcrowding.
If you look at some of the states that had a flare-up recently, they’re all doing very well.  Florida is going down rapidly.  I want to give a lot of credit to the governors.  Florida is going down, and Arizona is going down, way down.  They’ve done a fantastic job.  California, as you know, is going down.  And many other locations — it’s doing very well.  And many locations are really in fantastic shape — some with very little, if any, problem — large portions of the United States.
Those advocating for a never-ending, blanket, nationwide lockdown have no answer for what it would do to the mental, physical, and social health of millions of American children and people.  This includes parents, where they have to stay home with their children because — and they lose their work and they lose their job because their children isn’t at school.  They have to have somebody to take care of it, and they want to take care of their child.  They don’t trust people.  A society must put the health and safety of our children first.
A man who has the respect of everybody — he’s highly respected by me and anybody on this subject.  He’s just the expert.  Dr. Scott Atlas is here from Stanford, and he’s been working with us for a period of time.  And I thought it would be great — he was saying things to me the other day.  I said it would be great if you could tell that to the media.
So this is the first time I’ve shared the platform.  And it’s an honor to do so.  Scott is truly — he’s a brilliant man.  He’s a wonderful man.  And he cares about the subject very much.  And I’d like to ask Scott to come up please and say a few words.
Thank you, Scott.
DR. ATLAS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s obviously a great honor to be here and a great honor to serve this President, who’s really focused on the very important parts of the pandemic.
And I’m new here.  I’m just, sort of, getting involved, but I want to thank you and the Vice President and the entire team, the task force team, and all the people who are not very visible, really, for working so hard.  These people are working 24/7, and it’s — it’s quite amazing.
And I think that we — today, we had a fantastic event, that I’ll just mention, on opening the schools, because the President’s priority is to open the schools and open them safely and have parents have the options to either use open schools or do whatever they can to eventually get back to open schools, including any kind of hybrid or other arrangement they may want to do.
It was a great event.  We had a group of fantastic parents, teachers, medical experts, and it went very well.  And so I won’t spend a lot of time up here, but thank you very much and I hope I can help out in some way.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Steve?  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-081320/

5:37 P.M.  EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Nice to be with you all.  Good evening. 
    Before providing today’s update on the China virus, I want to address the violence, looting, and rioting taking place in the Democrat-controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle.  The mayors and governors of these states and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death. 
    New York City has an army of great police.  I know them very well.  And the law enforcement and the New York’s Finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job.  If they do their job, if they’re allowed to do their job,   the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly.  They do it well. 
    The mayor, Bill de Blasio, should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired without justification.  They were fired.  I guess that’s part of “Defund the Police” by the Democrats.  They should hire New York City’s Finest back.  You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do, actually, when it comes to terrorism and other things. 
    Together, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs, and Guardsmen available to quell any violence.  They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs — again, if allowed to do their jobs.  Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do their jobs.  The Democrats or the radical-left Democrats — or both, because they’re becoming one and the same, if you look at election results — the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left. 
    The city of Portland and the state of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and Guardsmen available.  Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available.  So Seattle — the city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people.  They have to be allowed to do their job.  I’m urging them to deploy these resources to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on — although a lot of the, unfortunately, fake news don’t like to put it on because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement.  They have to put it on.  They have to be honest with the people of this country. 
    But I’m offering all available federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals.  We have to be asked by the governors or the mayors, and we’ll be there very rapidly.  It’s ready, willing, and able.  We’re all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them.  We’ll do them very quickly.  You saw what happened in Minneapolis; they ripped the city apart.  When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately.  It was immediate and lasted. 
    These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent, leftwing extremism that you get to see if you’re watching the right news program.  Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of leftwing domestic terrorism.  They really are anarchists.  These are leftwing anarchists.  They are anarchists.  And I’m directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists — immediately, to stop them — and to work with the city and the state to get the job done. 
    Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately.  We’ll work with you.  And the local authorities know who they are.  They know where they come from.  They know a lot about them.  They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we’re ready to help.  If you need that help — you shouldn’t need that help, actually.  You should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well.  Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job. 
    What you’re seeing in Portland and Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America.  They want every city in America to resemble Portland, in a form.  They want to pass federal legislation gutting and hamstringing every police department in America.  They want to get rid of your Second Amendment.  They want to end cash bail; close prisons; defund police departments — or at least largely defund.  You see that with New York.  A billion dollars they took out of their police department, and crime has gone through the roof.  And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens.  If the left gains power, no city, town, or suburb in our country will be safe. 
    On the vaccine front, some very good news.  Today, I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. 
    We heard an update from the top scientists and the government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which, right now, aren’t too thrilled with me.  They’re taking millions of dollars’ worth of ads because I’ve created a favored-nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70 percent in some cases — numbers that have never been heard or thought of.  So when you see those ads, remember: That means your drug prices are coming down.  When you see ads attacking your President, it’s very simple — that means drug prices are going to be falling very soon.
    This evening, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate.  The federal government will own these vaccine doses; we’re buying them. 
    Recently, we also secured partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to support the large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines.  Doing very well on those vaccines — tremendous promise in every single one of them, and we have many of them.  And they’re years ahead of schedule.  This would have been — if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years. 
    Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already — the final stage of clinical trials.  This is the final stage.  We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery.  The military is ready to go.  They’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA, and we’re moving very close to that approval. 
    We’re on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses, as soon as the vaccine is approved, and up to 500 million shortly thereafter.  So we’ll have 600 million doses.  Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history. 
    We’ve treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma.  A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results which are incredible.  We look to a reduction and reduced mortality rate by 50 percent, and possibly even more than 50 percent. 
    I urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate.  We would really appreciate that because it’s been very successful — unbelievably successful — and we would love you to go and donate.
    As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible.  You’ve seen the numbers.  You see what’s going on yesterday, today — and tomorrow, in my opinion.  We’re very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401(k) numbers and everything else.
    Today, the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time, more than a 50 percent surge since just March.  So we’ve increased by 50 percent more than since just March.  It has gained approximately 9,500 points that same period — March — and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our nation — think of that.
    America’s economy is incredible, and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations.  Last quarter, the European Union’s GDP decline was nearly 40 percent worse than the United States.  So it’s 40 percent worse than the United States.  We’ve built such a strong base that we’re able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world, by far.
    France’s GDP decline was nearly 80 percent worse than ours.  And Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States.
    Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic — very substantial improvements.  Since last week, 87 percent of the counties in the United States report declining cases.  Think of that: 87 percent of the counties in the United States, they reported declining cases.
    Mortality has declined by 7 percent, and hospitalizations are declining rapidly.  States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25 percent.  But all Americans must remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible.  Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask.  And protect the elderly — always protect the elderly. 
    Since the end of July, the seven-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20 percent, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe.
    Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in three months — not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media.  The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62 percent since last week, unfortunately — and that is truly unfortunate.  It’s increased 82 percent in France, 113 percent in Spain, and 30 percent in the United Kingdom.  Those are big increases.  Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries.  And in our country, they’re going down.  We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by — a short time. 
    Even though America is the largest at-risk population — including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries — Europe has experienced a nearly 40 percent higher excess mortality rate than the United States.  We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-state area — which had a very, very hard time — and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill — something that the news doesn’t tell you.  They don’t tell you that.  They don’t like to tell you that.
    The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world.  India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people, has done 24 million.  So we’re at 66 million.  And think of it: India is at 24 million, and India is second. 
    The entire region of Latin America, comprising 33 countries, has conducted 25 million tests.  Yet, Latin America has more confirmed cases, by far, than the United States. 
    As we safely restore our great economy and reopen our schools — and hopefully we can watch colleges play football.  We want to get football in colleges.  These are young, strong people.  They won’t have a big problem with the China virus.  So we want to see college football start, and, hopefully, a lot of great people are going to be out there.  They’re going to be out there, playing football, and they’ll be able to fight it off.  And hopefully, it won’t bother them one bit.  Most of them will never get it, statistically.  But we know we’ll see more cases at some point, and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity, in addition to everything else that we’re doing.
    So, college football, get out there and play football.  People want to see it.  And stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem because people are not happy when that doesn’t happen. 
    You look at the NBA and what’s happening with the NBA and their poor ratings.  I don’t know; can’t imagine why.  But they didn’t stand, they didn’t show respect to our flag.  They didn’t show respect to our anth- — our National Anthem.  And maybe that’s having an impact, but just not good.
    The NFL had its problems, two years ago, when that happened.  They went way down in their ratings and their fans, and they struggled back.  And now, all of a sudden, they’re putting themselves in the same position.  So stand for your flag and stand for the National Anthem, and I think you’re going to do fantastically well.  Because a lot of people aren’t going to watch if you don’t; I’m one of them.
    That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death.  We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population.  We’ve learned that, I think, more than any single event, Scott.  We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population, and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness — diabetes, in particular. 
    And we are, at the same time, in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding.  We’re in great shape.
    On the nursing-home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy.  HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities as they continue to combat the China virus. 
    We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes.  And we’re in the process of delivering these vice- — devices to all 15,000 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes by the end of September.  So they’re going to have very, very rapid tests.  They won’t have to wait around two or three days or four days. 
    And that number has come down very substantially, compared to what it was.  When you send it to the labs, you get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it, and then to send it back.  But we are now at a position where we’re sending very, very rapid tests — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.
    We will care for America’s seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics.  And therapeutics are coming along very, very well.  We think we have some great answers on therapeutics, and you’ll be hearing that — about them in the very near future.  I’m very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital, and you give a shot, or you do what you have to do with a, perhaps, transfusion.  There’s combinations of what you can do, and people get better.  I like that very much.  I like that very, very much. 
    And that could even precede — and it’s successful in getting it — that will, I think, probably, even precede vaccines.  But therapeutically, we’re doing very, very well.  A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that we’re — that I’m seeing, and some of the results. 
    So, tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front, and our country should be very proud of itself.  We’re going to get it delivered very rapidly, as soon as it comes out. 
    Okay.  Questions, please?  Please, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-11-2020/

5:48 P.M. EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I thought I’d start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed — just the news.  Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the state of Virginia, including to many dead people.  This was an unprecedented mailing flub that’s heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts.  It’s a disaster — all over Virginia, half a million votes.  So that’s something you have to think about. 
    We don’t want to have a rigged election, I know that.  And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia or you mention China or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system.  And when you have this mail-in voting, it’s a — it’s very susceptible.  It’s something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans.  And I think that it’s something you have to start thinking about very seriously. 
    Our system is not equipped for it.  The Post Office is not equipped for it.  And people should vote, like they did in World War One and World War Two.  And your numbers will be — in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think — much better — on the coronavirus or the China virus.  But it’s something you have to look about — look at and say, “This is just crazy.” 
    This just came out: half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the state of Virginia to many people that weren’t living.  They had some sent to pets — dogs.  This is what we’re going to get into, and it’s going to be a disaster.  And it’s going to be thought of very poorly, and it’s going to hurt our country. 
    After our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement — we’re pro-jobs, pro-health safety — executive orders — the stock market went up 358 points today.  So we — we issued those executive orders, and the stock market went up 358 points today.  It’s quite a reaction.
    The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50 percent since March — 50 percent.  Think: If you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you have 50 percent.  The Nasdaq index continues to set new records.  It’s been up over 14 times; new record in Nasdaq. 
    And the S&P 500 and the Dow — Dow Jones are going to be — I mean, the way they’re going, it looks like they’re just about going to be topping records, hopefully, soon.
    SECRET SERVICE AGENT:  Sir, we’re just going to have to step out in the hall (inaudible).
    THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me?

1:18 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Democrats in Congress failed to act in the best interests of Americans hardest hit by this pandemic.  Amid inaction, President Trump stood up for every American who, through no fault of their own, needed relief.
     Politics as usual should find no place during this pandemic, but Democrats rejected multiple clean bills to provide relief.  The American people are tired of games.  They seek leadership, and President Trump delivered.
     This weekend, President Trump took executive action designed to provide the relief Democrats have denied to those who need it most.  Through four executive orders, he took the following steps:
     On the payroll tax, he deferred payments of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st through the end of 2020. 
     On unemployment assistance, states will provide 25 percent cost sharing, amounting to a total of $400 per week in benefits through the end of the year.
     And then, third, he extended the eviction protections.  President Trump will direct HUD to prevent evictions resulting from financial hardships caused by the virus, doing everything in his executive capacity to make sure those renting and those homeowners are protected.
     Finally, on student loans, he extended 0 percent interest and suspended loan payments through the end of the year.
     The bottom line is that these actions will help Americans.  President Trump is for the American people, and Democrats failed to deliver.
     Also, earlier this year, hundreds of Americans — working men and women — at the Tennessee Valley Authority — the TVA — were told that they would lose their jobs to lower-paid foreign workers imported from abroad, and then ser- — suffered the further indignity of training their foreign replacements.
     President Trump boldly and resolutely intervened in defense of these hardworking Americans — rallying to their case, rushing to their aid, and taking action to restore their jobs.  He invited laid-off workers and their representatives to the White House, and then he fired the chairman of the board of the TVA and one other board member.
     President Trump offered an ultimatum: The firings would continue until the cruel and heartless decision to fire the hardworking Americans was reversed.  TVA did reverse.  Layoffs have been canceled, and tech workers have been rehired. 
     In the words of Gay Henson, president of the Engineering Associates, IFPTE, Local 1937 — the labor union representing the 2- — the 2,200 highly skilled professionals employed by the TVA — in Ms. Henson’s words, “The President’s personal intervention saved these jobs, restored the workers to their rightful place, and set TVA on the path to returning to its mission of service to both the workers at the TVA and to the people of this country.”
     And, with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-10-2020/

Bedminster, New Jersey

4:21 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you, and good afternoon.  My administration has been working around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats on additional China virus relief.
Already, my administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief, saving many tens of millions of dollars and jobs.  And you see how fast the economy is coming back.  It does look like it’s going to be a very sharp “V.”  We have tremendous enthusiasm, tremendous spirit, and tremendous job growth.  We set a record on number of jobs in the last three months.  It’s the most jobs ever created in a three-month period — during a three-month period.  That’s great.
Before we begin, I’ve just signed two bills that are great for our vets.  Our vets are very special.  We passed Choice, as you know — Veterans Choice — and Veterans Accountability.  And they’ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no President has ever been able to do it.  And we got it done so veterans have Choice.  And now you have Accountability — that if you don’t love your vets, if you’re in the VA and you don’t love the vets or take care of the vets, you can actually get fired if you don’t do your job.  We want people that love our vets.
The first expands the eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes.  So we have an expansion of benefits, an expansion of various elements of being and working with the VA for vets with blindness and — in particular, blindness in both eyes.  And we have a lot of problems with blindness in the VA, and we’re doing something about it.  They’ve been talking about this for many years.  So that is expanding eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes.  Okay?
Second is — requires the VA to establish a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes.  And you know what that all means, and it’s really something that they’ve been trying to get done for a long time.  The second requires the VA to establish a treatment court.  So this is a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes.  Okay?  I think it’s self-explanatory.
We’ve wanted this for a long time, they’ve been trying to get it for a long time, and now we have it.  And I want to thank everybody for helping us get that done.  We had a lot of support from a lot of great people, including people in the VA.
In the current negotiations, we have repeatedly stated our willingness to immediately sign legislation providing expanded unemployment benefits, protecting Americans from eviction, and providing additional relief payments to families.  Democrats have refused these offers; they want to negotiate.  What they really want is bailout money for states that are run by Democrat governors and mayors, and that have been run very badly for many, many years — and many decades, in fact.  You know the states; everybody knows who we’re talking about and what we’re talking about.  I don’t think we have to go over it.
But what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money.  It has nothing to do with the China virus.  It has nothing to do with anything that we’ve been talking about over the last period of time.  They want to bailout states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years — and, in fact, in all cases, many decades.  And we’re not willing to do that.
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demands and the radical-left Democrats, and we just can’t do that.  So, hopefully, we can do something with them at a later date, but we’re going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important, and will take care of, pretty much, this entire situation.
As we know it and as you have been covering it in some cases — actually covering it accurately — many of the far-left policies they’re pushing have nothing to do, again, with what we have been working on so hard — namely, the corona.  You can call it so many different names.  What a horrible thing China released upon the world.
One third of their bill — the HEROES Act — is spending completely unrelated money to the virus.  Here are just a few of the policies in their extreme-left bill.  And, again, this is a bill supported by Biden, and Biden is totally controlled now by the Bernie Sanders left wing of the party.  And, in fact, he’s gone further left than Bernie Sanders ever dreamt of going.  So, obviously, other than Bernie have brought him left.  If you look at the manifesto that they’ve agreed to, it’s far further left than I’ve ever heard anything about Bernie Sanders.
The massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states we talked about — that’s one of the things they’re looking to do.  Measures designed to increase voter fraud.  Banning voter ID; they want to ban voter ID.  We should have voter ID in every state.  Every state should have voter ID.  You have ID on everything you do, practically, yet every- — everybody has voter ID.  Everybody has ID except for voters.  When you vote, you don’t want ID; they don’t want —
We have some states with it; it works out great.  And if you want to stop fraud in elections, have voter ID.  They want measures designed to increase voter fraud, which is banning voter ID in all states and banning requirements for signature verification in federal elections.
Now, why would they want, in this bill — which really has nothing to do with what we’re talking about: stimulus — something banning voter ID?  In every single state, they want to ban it, including states where we already have it, because we have some states where we have it — Indiana and others that do very well.
Why would they want to ban voter ID in all states?  And why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in federal election?  Who would want a bill banning signature verification?  What’s that all about?
You know what it’s about?  Fraud.  That’s what they want: fraud.  They want to try and steal this election because, frankly, it’s the only way they can win the election.
The bill also requires all states to do universal mail-in balloting — which nobody is — nobody is prepared for — regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure.  They want to steal an election.  That’s all this is all about: They want to steal the election.
So, in the bill, they have a bill that requires all states to do universal mail-in balloting, regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure.  Like in Nevada, it’s such a disaster.  Their infrastructure is a total disaster.  They don’t want to have signature verification, they don’t want to have any of the safeguards that you need, and they don’t want to have safeguards that are so common and so basic and even other states that we disagree with have.  This Nevada thing is a mess, but we’ll see how the courts determine — what the courts determine.  But they certainly don’t have the infrastructure in Nevada.  So we’ll see how it is.
As you know, we brought suit last week, and we’ll see how that all works out.  I think we’re going to win it.  But, basically, what they’re trying to do with all of these requirements, including no signature verification: They’re trying to steal an election.
And I was in Ohio, I was in Texas, I was in Florida over the last four or five days.  And if you would see the crowds along the highways and the roadways, people have said they’ve never seen anything like it, and they haven’t seen anything like it.  And the press doesn’t report it because they’re fake news.
They even want to force states to implement the controversial practice known as “ballot harvesting” — a very dangerous practice — meaning they would allow Democrat Party operatives to deposit thousands and thousands of completed ballots at the post office without any verification of who filled them out, including a verification of signatures on the ballots.  So you’re not even going to have a verified signature.  Anybody — I could sign it.  You could sign it.  Anybody in this room could sign it.  And that’s going to count as a vote.  How can you do a thing like this?
So this is what they’re asking for.  This is what Nancy Pelosi and Crying Chuck Schumer are asking for.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay?  It’s ridiculous.  It’s horrible.  It’s a horrible thing.
The Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.  So if you were able to get into our country illegally — and our border is, as you know, doing very well right now.  We have a very strong border, and the wall is up to 276 miles.  And we’ll be completed with it around the end of the year.  We’re going to do some extra mileage in certain areas that people didn’t realize were so bad, so we’ll be completed with it.  Right after, we’re going to do the additional mileage.  We’ll do it probably a little bit after the year.
I think, from what I’ve heard, Joe Biden — Sleepy Joe — wants to rip the wall down.  He wants people to pour into our country.  They want to have open borders.  We don’t want to have open borders.
So the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.  They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention.  They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons.  How do you like that one?  And this is in the bill that we’re talking about?  What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy?  What does this have to do with the coronavirus?  Another name.  What does this have to do with this?
So, think of that: They required the mass release of illegal aliens from detention.  What does this have to do with what we’re trying to do?  They want to put this — and this is a radical-left policy, so they can go to Portland and try and rip the place apart that they’ve been doing for many years and they’ve been doing for years and years.
They also compel the mass release of inmates.  What does this have to do with what we’re talking about?  This is Nancy Pelosi — Crazy Nancy — and Chuck Schumer.  They want to compel you to do this stuff, and this has nothing to do with what we’re talking about, and it includes serious felons.  They want to have these people released on a mass basis, including serious felons.
That’s page 1,689; page 1,762.  Think of it: 1,762.  And that’s nowhere near the end of their bill.  They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read.  These people — I don’t — I honestly don’t believe they love our country, you want to know the truth.
In addition to demanding these extreme partisan provisions, Democrats are actively blocking the following measures: support for K-12 schools to help them safely open, additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to help millions of workers on the payroll.  This is a great program.  Very successful.  Kept a lot of businesses open.  That’s why we’re doing so well in reopening our country.  Additional money for hospitals.  Testing and vaccines.  Direct payments of $3,400 for a family of four.
Now, remember, this is what the extreme partisans — this — we got — we have to — this is what we’re talking about.  Democrats are actively blocking the things that we want.  And what we want is good for people.  Those — these are things that they’re blocking: support for K-12 schools, so they can open.  Think of that.
Also, direct payments of the $3,400 for a family of four-plus, then funding for childcare and mental health care.  And you need that, especially when you have so much of a lockdown.  You need that: mental health care.
Funding for broadband, airports, and agriculture, rental assistance, and support for community banks and credit unions to help them provide $100 billion in loans to the hardest-hit communities, including rural communities and farmers.  They don’t want anybody to get that.  Democrats are obstructing all of it.
Therefore, I’m taking executive action.  We’ve had it.  And we’re going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers, and I’ll be signing these bills in a very short period of time.
First one is on providing a payroll tax holiday to Americans earning less than $100,000 per year.  In a few moments, I will sign a directive, instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st.  And we’re actually going to be making that; we just got the word.  We’re just getting some word from a lot of people.  We didn’t think we’d have to do this because we thought the Democrats would be reasonable, but they’ve been not only unreasonable, they’ve been ridiculous.
So we’re going to make that August 1st, most likely.  It’ll be August 1st.  We’ll let you know the exact date, but we’re looking like August 1st.  So it’d be August 1st through the end of 2020.  This will mean bigger paychecks for working families, as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the China virus once and for all.
And we’re doing very good with the numbers.  You see it’s going down in Arizona very, very substantially and rapidly.  Going down in California.  Going down in Texas.  Going down in Florida.  Other areas are propping up a little bit, but we’re watching them very closely.  We understand the disease, and we’re watching them very closely, especially our senior citizens and our senior citizens’ residences.
If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.  So I’m going to make them all permanent.
Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that.  They don’t want that because they’re adding $3 trillion in taxes.  So they’ll have the option of raising everybody’s taxes and taking this away.
But if I win, I may extend and terminate.  In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.  And so, we’ll see what happens.  Biden probably won’t be doing that; you’ll have to ask him.  I don’t think he knows what he’s doing.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter and applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Second, I’m signing an executive order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS, and CDC to make sure renters and homeowners can stay in their homes.
So I’m protecting people from eviction.  Yet you’ve been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction.  I said, “Let’s do that separately.  That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live.”  And they didn’t even want to protect people from eviction.
So, they would get evicted — it’s not their fault that this virus came into our country; it’s China’s fault.  And came into the world — by the way, a lot of the people, a lot of the states that were doing the best are having some problems.  A lot of the states that we weren’t thinking were doing the best are doing very well.
You look at some of the countries involved.  Some of the countries that were really standing out as examples are now exploding.  But they’ll get it down; they understand it.  We’re dealing with them.  We’re dealing with a lot of countries.
We’re providing thousands and thousands of ventilators all over the world right now.  We make a lot of ventilators.  We started off with very little, and we’re making a lot.  And we have thousands in our stockpile, but we’re making thousands a month.  And we’re providing many of them — thousands and thousands — to other countries that would never be able to get them.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, and work with landlords and lenders to keep Americans safely in their homes.  So we don’t want people being evicted.  And the bill — the act that I’m signing will solve that problem, largely — hopefully, completely.
The third action I’m taking today will also provide additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus.  Under the CARES Act, I proudly signed expanded unemployment benefits into law.  Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief.  They even oppose measures that would give bonuses to workers returning to the job.  They were totally opposed to that.
For this reason, I’m taking action to provide an additional or an extra $400 per week in expanded benefits: $400.  Okay?  So, that’s generous, but we want to take care of our people.  Again, it wasn’t their fault; it was China’s fault.
States will be asked to cover 25 percent of the cost using existing funding, such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the Coronavirus Relief Fund.  Under this plan, states will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose, and the federal government will cover 75 percent of the cost.  So we’re all set up.  It’s $400 per week.
And we’re doing that without the Democrats.  We should have been able to do it very easily with them, but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people.
Fourth, I am signing a directive providing relief to student loan borrowers.  Earlier this year, we slashed student loan interest rates to zero.  I don’t know if people know that because the press doesn’t ever report it, but maybe they’re watching now.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  The press doesn’t report a lot of good things that are good for the people and good for the country.
Earlier this year, we slashed student loans’ interest rates to zero percent and suspended student loan payments, and Congress extended that policy through September 30th.  Today, I’m extending this policy through the end of the year, and we’ll extend it further than that — most likely, right after December 1st.  So we look like we’re going to be extending that.  They’re paying zero interest.  And again, not their fault that their colleges are closed down and not their fault that they’re unable to get what they bargained for.
Through these four actions, my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to Americans struggling in this difficult time.  And the beautiful thing about this difficult time is we’re now coming back and setting records.
We’ll also ensure that our economic comeback continues full speed ahead.  And with the $400 and all of the other measures that we’re talking about and will be signing in a little while, that will happen.
We’re further looking at additional tax cuts, including income tax relief, income tax cuts, and capital gains tax cuts.  So we’re going to be looking at that — capital gains — for the purpose of creating jobs, and income tax is self-explanatory.  And it’ll be income tax for middle-income and lower-income people, but middle-income people because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality.  I’m saying that as a Republican, and you do have tax inequality.
So we’re going to be looking at income tax, and we’re going to be looking at capital gains tax cuts on both, and maybe substantial.  And we’ll be reporting back fairly shortly on that.  That’s big news.  That’s big news, but very important.  We want to have our jobs flourish.  We want to have our companies do great.  We want to have the 401(k)s, which are now at a level — if you look at the stock market, it’s great.
If you have stocks in NASDAQ, you’re higher than you ever were, including even — this is still during the pandemic.  The stock market — because they see such incredible things are happening, smart people — the stock market is that almost an all-time high.  We’re just short of it.  And NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/

7:34 P.M. EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And it’s a great honor to have everybody here.  And I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend.  We have a terrific number of things, and some very positive things to tell you tonight. 
    I want to begin by giving an update on the economy.  Economic health is vital to public health.  That’s why our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school.  Very important. 
    We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May.  And I will say that the job growth that we’ve seen over the last three months — 9.3 million — is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history.  That’s big stuff.  That’s big news and great news. 
    Over the past three months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs.  Over the last three months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs.  Remember “You’d need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs”?  And we’re getting them even in a pandemic — which is disappearing; it’s going to disappear. 
    And 639,000 brand-new construction jobs.  Over half of the new jobs are fulltime jobs, and wages are up by 4.8 percent, which is terrific.  Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30 percent since April.  Think of that: 30 percent since April. 
    Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32 percent.  Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns — incredibly hard — increased by nearly 1 million over the past three months, and that’s also a record.  That’s a job record: African American, 1 million.  It’s job record.
    We must ensure that the progress continues.  My administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world.  So we’ve contributed $3 trillion.
    My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits; provide protections against evictions — the terrible thing happens with evictions.  Not fair.  It wasn’t their fault that we were infected with this disease from China.  And get relief to American families. 
    Yet, tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical leftwing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus.  Nothing to do with it at all.  So you have a virus that comes in, and you have people in Congress that don’t want to help our people. 
    If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act, under my authority as President, to get Americans the relief they need.  And what we’re talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months until the end of the year.  And I can extend it at a certain period.  Hopefully, I will be here to do the job.  We’re going to do the job; we’ve been doing the job like nobody could.  Nobody would, actually.  And so, we’re going to have the payroll tax go until the end of the year, and it’ll be retroactive to July 1st.  So we’re going to go back to July 1st, and it’ll go to the end of the year — payroll tax.  At the end of the year, it may be extended.
    We’re going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year.  So unemployment benefits will be — that’s a big one — will be brought out to the end of the year. 
    And defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice — so students who are paying student loans and, in many cases, they’re not even allowed to go back into their colleges.
    Extend the eviction moratorium — we will be extending that so people aren’t evicted.  Not their fault. 
    We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France, concerning numerus subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon.  Horrible, horrible event.
    At 3 p.m. this afternoon, I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft on the — are on the way, and they’re fully loaded — fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things, lots of emergency equipment.  Also first responders, technicians, doctors, and nurses are on their way.  This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time.  A horrible event.
    We’ll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world.  Everyone wants to help.  We spoke to a lot of people; they all want to help. 
    The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come.  We’re working very closely with their government and with their leaders.
    And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families — a much larger number of families than anybody would have thought and than anybody at first thought — but all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy.  We stand firmly with the people of Lebanon and will continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time.  We have not seen anything like this in a long time.
    As you know, earlier this week I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority who have been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority.  As you know, this is a form of utility.  It’s been around for a long time, since FDR. 
    And the head person — not controlled by government, but it’s sort of semi-public, in a sense — gets paid the highest salary in the world of government.  He gets $8 million a year.  That’s not a bad amount of money.  It’s $8 million a year.  And we are not accepting that.  Even though we’re not the ones that appoint him or her — but, in this case, him — we’re not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year.  This has been going on for many years.  And we will do something about that, and we’re already in negotiations right now, including possible termination. 
    They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers — the workers at TVA — were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this, and on top of the $8 million salary, and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year.  But, on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions — these incredible people — in order to train the lower-cost foreign workers imported to replace them.  How’s that for a law?  And this was set up, originally, to create jobs and economic development, and now they’re getting fired, and they’re supposed to train people for a much lower — who get a much lower salary.  It’s crazy.
    This was a grave injustice.  I fired the chairman of the board in response.  On Friday, I fired the chairman of the board, along with one other board member.  That’s the one thing we have; we have the right to fire board members.  And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the board members.  And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course, totally. 
    And today, I’m proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee and Kentucky and other areas that are covered — great states, great states — that the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back.  They’re being rehired as we speak.
    In this administration, we live by two rules: Buy American and hire American.  You can’t do that; you can’t fire all our workers and hire people back from other faraway parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people.  And they can never train them as good as what you have, because they’ve been there for many years.  They’ve done a fantastic job, and they love the TVA. 
    We had a lot of people in the office the other day — a lot of the media was covering it.  They love the Tennessee Valley Authority.  So — and they’re so proud to work for it.  But this happened and it was a terrible thing, so now they’re going to get their jobs back — they’re all going to be getting their jobs back.
    Nearly every nation on Earth continues to combat the virus.  A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe.  Cases continue to surge in Latin America.  That’s, right now, the most infected place anywhere in the world.  They have more than doubled in recent days.  Latin America is doing very little testing.  They’re not really equipped to do that.  It’s tough. 
    In the United States, more than 80 percent of jurisdictions report decline in cases.  We’re doing very well.  You don’t hear that too often from the media, but we’re doing very well.  We have a very large country — a very complex country, in a sense.  More than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week.  So, if you look at that, more than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week.  But we have to remain vigilant.  We’re doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.
    Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July.  The southern states that were very strong hotspots not long ago — Arizona, Texas, Florida — continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hos- — hospital beds. 
    Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus in-patients.  Since mid-June, it’s gone — the governor was up, and we had a great meeting — Governor Ducey.  And the meeting was terrific.  But since mid-June — so they’re doing well, and it’s going down — heading down very rapidly, actually.
    Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley, and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths.
    Florida is also stabilizing, and statewide positive test rate continues to decrease — from 13 percent on July 23rd, to 8 percent this week.  Florida has done very well.  It’s going down; it’s heading down, actually, quite rapidly.  And even Miami, which was the hottest spot in Florida, is heading downward.  But Florida has done very well.
    Texas has done very well, and rapidly.  And Arizona has done incredibly well.  So it — Arizona has really been a very rapid drop.
    New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1 percent of emergency room visits due to the China virus — the illness.  It took a devastating toll on both states, as you know.  While both states really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year, thankfully we have not seen a resurgence.  They’ve been doing a good job.  Everybody is working very hard.  Both governors are working very, very hard.  We’re in touch with them.  We’re supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed, if needed.  But they’re needing very little right now.  They’re in very good shape.  We will continue to monitor the new cases.
    Throughout this crisis, my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York, and to the people of every state — all of our states. 
    We’re carefully monitoring California’s Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. 
    We’re carefully watching regions from increasing cases, including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest.  We’re watching them all very carefully.  It’s vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable. 
    For this reason, we’ve delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America.  We’re focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems.  Diabetes is a big problem.  Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.  That’s an incredible number, when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. 
    And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes, and they are very, very vigilant.  They’re doing a very good job now.  They’ve really done something that I think is special.  They’re doing very well, in terms of the virus.  They’re working very hard.  And a lot of things happen — a lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard.  But the representatives of nursing homes — in some cases, the ownership of nursing homes — they’re working very hard.
    The federal government and the private sector have delivered more than 9 million N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns, and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone.  Think of that.  We provided $3.4 billion to the state of New Jersey in emergency relief funding.  So we happen to be in New Jersey right now, so those are great numbers.  The governor is working very hard; Governor Murphy is doing a good job.  We’re working very closely with him.  We’ve also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and healthcare facilities. 
    And through the Paycheck Protection Program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses.  A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well, they’re there because of what we did with Paycheck Protection.
    On therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials.  This would be years ahead of schedule.  We have done wonders with the FDA.  I want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn.  But we have phase three trials already going on, which is, most people would have said, impossible to even think about. 
    Today, Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead’s drug, remdesivir — where we’ve had tremendous success.
    Last week alone, my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients.  Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what’s going on.  And if you can go to a blood bank — if you’ve had this disease and — and beat it — and there are a lot of people that have — if you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help.
    The United States is only 5 percent of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25 percent of the world’s testing.  Think of that: 5 percent and we’ve given 25 percent of the world’s testing.  Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we’re constantly showing cases — cases, cases, cases are up.  Well, the reason cases are up, because we’re doing — one of the reasons — we’re doing a lot of testing. 
    We’re doing much more testing than anyone else.  Close to 65 million tests, where other countries have done very little testing.  They’ll test people if they get sick.  They’ll test people if they go into the hospital.  They’ll test certain people.  We’re doing tremendous testing.  And we’re especially doing big testing at the nursing homes. 
    Over the last week, the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pooling samples.  And we’ve also been able to send out many more of the tests, which are the 5-minute to 15-minute-result tests.  Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we’re very focused on and doing.  But in the not-too-distant future, we’ll have so many tests where it’s a quick test — they call it a “quick test” — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.  So we won’t even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving.  Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and, let’s say, a day at the laboratory — that’s three days right there.  And the other tests, you can have them in 5 to 15 minutes.
    Over the next two weeks, I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers.  That’s a big thing.  I’ve always been very strongly in favor — we have to cover pre-existing conditions.  So we will be pursuing a major executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all of its customers. 
    This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of. 
    This follows a series of executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices — and significantly.  We had the only year, which was last year, where drug prices went down in 51 years.  But we’re talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now, even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that’s usually a reason — they’re not happy.  They can’t be too thrilled.  But they’ve made a lot of money over the years, and prices just go up.  Not fair. 
    This includes a landmark executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans — and charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries.  So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries.  That means our country can’t be charged more. 
    So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price, and we’re paying many times that price in the United States — because we pay for all of the research, the development, the promotion, and other things — we will get what’s called a “favored-nations clause.”  We’re going to have — and I signed a favored-nations clause so that the United States — which is the number-one purchaser of drugs by far in the world — biggest purchaser in the world, not even close.  You have other countries that are bigger, if you look at India, China, et cetera.  Not too many.  But we have countries that are bigger, but not even close, in terms of ordering drugs.  We’re the number-one country in the world. 
    But we have a favored-nation — so if somebody has a — a drug — in many cases, it comes from a plant — the same plant.  It comes from — it’s the same pill; it’s the same medicine or medication.  Whatever the lowest country charges — so if Germany charges 10 cents for a pill, and we charge $2 — and I only use Germany as an example — then we get that — we get that for 10 cents.  So what’s going to happen is that’s going to go up a little bit, and ours is going to come down a whole lot.  So it’s the favored nations.
    And I will tell you that big pharma is not happy.  For too long, we’ve been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries.  We’ve subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe.  Nobody talked about it.  Everybody wondered, “How come every President that runs for office says they’re going to lower drug prices, and they never do?  They go through the right — roof.”  Over the last administration they went up, like, skyrocketing — skyrocketing.  That’s Biden.  Biden is not going to be able to be able to do it.  He has no clue. 
    So what’s happening is: We are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands.  And we’re going to give, essentially, all of the benefit that, frankly, they have as great negotiators — those benefits are going to go to our people.  So it’s called a “favored-nations clause,” and you can look it up, and you can see.  And nobody has had the courage to institute it, to call it because it’s a very big — it’s a very big step.  But it’s something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent.  We’re talking about numbers that are unbelievable. 
    I also signed an executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves.  These are some of the richest people in the world.  Everyone talked about middlemen.  I’ve heard about them for years, on prescription drug prices — middlemen.  I guess you’d have to say to be politically correct, “middlemen and women.”  But you never heard the “middlewomen” before; you heard “middlemen.”  That’s the term. 
    And, you know, say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product.  They produce the pill.  They produce the medicine — the medication.  But these people make billions and billions of dollars.  I don’t know who they are, but they’re very rich.  But they won’t be so rich anymore. 
    This executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients.  So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I’m going to lose a lot of friends, even though I have no idea who these people are. 
    AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.) 
    THE PRESIDENT:  On opioids, I’m pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America.  In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic.  And we’ve done very well.  We’ve done — it was prior to the virus — we were down 18, 19, and 20 percent.  But when you think about it, that means that you have 80 percent, and that’s not acceptable. 
    The wall is going up.  We have 276 miles of wall.  It’s having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already.  It’ll be finished toward the end of the year.  And it’s had a very, very big impact.
    On Portland: Finally, I’d like to address that situation.  Portland is a disaster.  It’s been a disaster for many, many years.  Brave federal law enforcement officers singlehandedly — the officers, they singlehandedly saved the federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists — and that’s what they are.  You know, when you find Molotov cocktails in somebody’s knapsack, and they say, “No, I’m just here to have a good time.”  (Laughter.)  These are really sick, disturbed people.
    The disgraced mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob.  He was at the mercy of the mob, too.  If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible.  He went out there and they wanted to rip him apart.  But, fortunately, he had five people with him called “security.”
    Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob.  As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down — an act of attempted murder.  Leftwing, violent extremism poses an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it.  You have no idea how much we stop, but it’s an ideology we have to stop.
    “When you commit arson…” — this is a quote from the mayor; he’s come a long way.  He just made this quote.  “When you commit arson with an accelerant in [the] attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who…have intentionally [been] trapped inside, you are not a” demonstrator — or “you’re not demonstrating,” said, Mayor 2722, “You are attempting to commit murder.”  That’s come a long way; he’s come a long way when he made that statement. 
    What you’re seeing in Portland is the radical left’s agenda in action.  Portland is their roadmap for America.  If the radical left gets in — and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet; he’s merely a puppet.  But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want.  That’s what they want.  Why?  Who knows?  Doesn’t matter.  It’s a different thinking, but it’s a mess. 
    And I want to thank Homeland Security.  They’ve done a fantastic job.  We had our people go in.  They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse, and the courthouse was saved, and other federal buildings were saved.  And we would like to be asked by the mayor and the governor — we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours, just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city.  But the National Guard went in, did a phenomenal job. 
    It was over in three hours.  After watching six days of horror, it ended in three hours.  You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street, just to — it was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things. 
    So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately, but we are supposed to be asked.  If we’re not asked and if it continues, we’ll have to make a decision.  But it’s a very easy thing for us to do.  We could stop it very quickly.  It’s been going on now for 76 days.  But our buildings are very secure.
    If the Democrats controlled in Washington — the Democrats’ control of Washington — they’d pass — with all of the things they do — legislation gutting every single police department in America.  They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department.  At a minimum, they’re to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department.
    No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe.  Your suburbs would be a disaster.  Your cities, your towns would be a disaster.  They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we’re waiting for the mayor.  We’ve sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we’re waiting for them to call — the governor, the mayor.  We could do a very good job in Chicago.  Nobody’s ever seen anything like that — this country. 
    And yet, nationwide numbers are good, despite the Chicagos and the Portlands — and, frankly, the New Yorks, when you look at what’s happened in New York.  Three hundred and forty-eight percent increase in the last number of months.  Nobody has seen anything like that.  It’s so sad.  To me, it’s so sad because I love New York.  And it’s so sad.  And it — all it is, is horrible, horrible incompetent management by politicians that truly don’t know what they’re doing.
    So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America.  And a vast majority of people agree with me.  A vast majority.  Most people.  They don’t speak up as much as they could, but we know they’re there, and everybody else knows they’re there, too. 
    So, with that, I’ll take a few questions from the media.  They’ve been here for a long time, and they’ve been waiting outside for a long time.  And they wait for these moments.  So it was a lot of fun.  (Laughter.)
    Please, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-bedminster-nj/

549,Trump,2020-08-04 13:07:00+00:00,"Remarks by President Trump in Press Briefing | August 4, 2020",Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
6:07 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Let me begin by sending America’s deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed, hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut.  Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families.  The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon.  I have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon, and we will be there to help.  It looks like a terrible attack.
     I also want to provide the latest on Tropical Storm Isaias.  Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East Coast, and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible.  I spoke to Governor Cooper, I spoke to Governor DeSantis, and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA, and they’re working very hard.
     Coastal areas in the storm’s path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents, while inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds.  FEMA is responding to states that have requested the assistance.  We have a list of those states; we can give them to you in a little while.  And my administration is monitoring the situation very closely.
     We have the military on guard, but we have — FEMA is there, in all cases.  The Corps of Engineers is ready if needed — the Army Corps of Engineers.  Very talented people.  I urge everyone in the storm’s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities.
     I now want to update you on the path forward, having to do with the China virus.  Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers, which are rather spectacular, that just came out.  The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management — that’s “ISM”; most of you know it by “ISM” — increased for the third month in a row, rising nearly 2 points in July to 54.2 — that’s fantastic — the highest reading since March of 2019. 
     This is remarkable, considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest, in particular, virus hotspots.  The ISM measures — and it’s a very strong measure of new orders.  It rose 5 points in July, to 61.5, in its highest rating, that would be, since September of 2018.  That’s a big number. 
     Since the April low, new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM, dating back all the way to 1948.  So, 34 points — that’s the largest since 1948. 
     Similarly, the ISM’s measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest 3-month gain in over 70 years.  That’s some — some number.
These were somewhat surprising, but I’ve been saying we’re doing well, and those numbers are really spectacular. 
     Automobile sales, likewise, are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up, stunningly.  It’s a 65 percent increase since then, to 14.5 million units, which is a — a massive number. 
     The great strength and great news is really for states like — in particular, Michigan; and Ohio; South Carolina; Pennsylvania, very good; Florida, little bit.  These are great numbers.  Record-setting numbers. 
     The strength in new car sales is also evident in the used car market, where soaring demand — literally, soaring demand — is putting upward pressure on the used car prices.  This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry.  The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector — and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers.  We’re very, very happy with these numbers.  And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers, in a very positive way.
     Economy-wide inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter.  A crash, in that case, means a good thing, not a bad thing.  That’s the largest drop ever on record — ever. 
     Homebuilder sentiment, likewise, is soaring, as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year.  And new homes recently made a 13-year high.  So we have a 13-year high in new home — new home construction. 
     New business applications are very strong.  That just came out.  The widely followed Atlanta Fed GDP — and it’s something that they have just come out with — now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates.  It looks like it’s showing a 20 percent annualized growth in the current quarter.  So 20 percent in the current quarter; we’ll take that all day long.  I — let’s see if that’s right.  That’s a projection.  So we’ll see if that’s right.  The Atlanta Fed — very respected. 
     The virus — back to that — we are continuing to monitor and monitor, in particular, hotspots across the South, Southwest, and the West.  And we’re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well, actually, especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for — ever since we’ve gotten to understand this horrible, horrible plague that’s been unleashed on our country by China.
     As of yesterday, cases are declining in 70 percent of the jurisdictions, compared to 36 percent last Monday.  That’s a big, big number.  Eleven out of thirteen states with the positive rate above 10 percent have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July.  In other states, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always is strong, even though the numbers are getting very good — states that have a test positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent.  And in the states with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. 
     We must ensure that these states do not become new flare-ups, so we’re watching them very, very closely.  Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths.
     Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak.  So the death — the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level.  One is too much — one death — because this should have never happened to us.  It should have been stopped at — very easily, by China, in Wuhan.  
     Thanks to our major advances in treatment, we’ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups.  Compared to April, mortality rates are 85 percent lower among individuals aged 18 to 69, and 70 percent lower among individuals over 70 years old.
     We’ve also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly.  Approximately 85 percent of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65 — just getting some very accurate numbers on this.  And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications.
     Since the pandemic began, nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted-living centers.  That’s an incredible statistic, when you hear that number.  This data, underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk.
     As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly, and we’re doing that.  We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense.  And those with underlining [sic] conditions, especially the elderly with the underlining [sic] — whether it’s heart or diabetes — they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems.  While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school.
     Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately, and that’s what we’re doing.  This is the science-based approach, and it’s good with us.  Working very hard on that.  An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest-risk populations, while inflicting massive economic pain, long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. 
     So there won’t be lockdowns, but we watch specific areas.  We’re very careful and we’re putting out embers.  We’re putting out flames.  When you look at what’s happening with Miami, and it’s going — the numbers are going down.  But Florida is going down very significantly.  Texas and California are going down rather significantly.
     On telemedicine, as we discussed the last time, as — and as I said numerous times during this day, it’s an incredible thing that’s happening.  A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth, so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes.  And that’s what’s happening.  The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million — so from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week.  In total, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began.  That’s a tremendous thing that’s happened with telehealth.
     As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines.  Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials, with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks.  And you’ve read and seen what’s happened today.  Today’s news was very exciting. 
     Through Operation Warp Speed, we’re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we’re determined to have a vaccine very quickly.  We think we’re going to have something very soon. 
     We have great companies.  These are the — among the greatest companies in the world.  But right now, they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices — prescription drug prices — very massively.  Some of these companies are involved in that; some of them aren’t.  We’re having a tremendous — you’ll see a tremendous drop in price.  We’re using favored nations — we’re using the rebates.  We’re using everything. 
     For so long, I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are.  They call them “the middlemen.”  And they are very wealthy.  Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people. 
     And we’re doing the rebates.  We’re doing purchases from other countries — like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to, under a very bad system.  I don’t call it “archaic”; I call it “bad” because it’s meant, really, for drug companies to get higher prices.
     But under — under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is $2, we’re allowed to say we want favored nations, and we want the pill for the same — the same as the lowest country in the world.  If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that’s the price we’re going to get.  Drug companies aren’t too happy about that — big pharma.
     We’ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness.  Today, the NIH — we’re — very exciting — announced that they’re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country.  We’re going to move — move very quickly.  Results look very good already.  Incredible results. 
     More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway, and we’ve secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir — of remdesivir.  We’re really doing a job with it, and it’s helping a lot of people.  That’s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good — relatively speaking, that is.  But that’s for American hospitals through the month of September.  So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September.  That’s big news.
     The United States also has far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world.  Testing has been incredible, what we’ve been able to do.  Nobody is even close.  Since March 12th, we’ve increased daily testing by 32,000 percent.  How’s that?  Thirty-two thousand percent.  Somebody would say, “That must be a typo.”  It’s not a typo.  Thirty-two thousand percent. 
     We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide, averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week.  And now that we’re understanding the virus, we’re understanding very much what we’re doing with respect to who it affects, who it’s destroying, and who gets away with it — like young people, very young people.  We’ll be having some interesting statements having to do a testing and focus testing.  I call it “focus testing.”
     By comparison, Mexico — so we’re doing numbers that are incredible.  But by comparison, Mexico — as you know, the President was here; he’s a great guy — but their — their numbers are much different.  They do about 1 million tests.  France has done 2.9 million tests.  Canada is around the 4 million mark.  Australia is around the 4 million mark.  The United States is testing more people in a single week than, in many cases, large segments or large, well-known countries all put together.  It’s been an amazing achievement: the testing and the quality of the testing also.  And now we’re doing testing where you can have results in 5 minutes, in 7 minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting to come back from labs — for it to come back from labs.
     Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Phoenix; Miami; Jacksonville, Florida; McAllen, Texas; Bakersfield, California.  And this week, we’re opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas; Atlanta.  To date, more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites. 
     Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual’s blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. 
     FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than — we have new numbers — more than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls, and 21 billion gloves — billion.  Can you believe that?  Billion gloves.
     And we distribute that to the governors, different states.  And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy, that I can tell you.  No — no complaints from any of them.  They’re very, very happy.  What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done.
     In our National Stockpile, we’ve tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million; tripled the number of gowns to 15 million; and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000.  These numbers are growing every day, and we’re now making thousands of ventilators — many thousands of ventilators a month.  And we’re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators.  They’re very hard to produce.  They’re very complicated machines.  So we’re — we’re fully stocked here, and we’ve made sure that every state is fully stocked, but we’re getting them to a lot of countries that need help.
     We’ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine.  I’m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. 
     And I want to thank you all for being here.  We’ll take a few questions.
     Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-4-2020/

1:04 P.M.  EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello.  Sorry to keep you all waiting.  Before I begin, it is day 42 of the botched New York City primary, where still there is no election results in one congressional race.  This, as the New York Times notes, is due to, quote, “the deluge of 400,000 mail-in ballots,” previewing the, quote, “challenges facing the nation as it looks towards conducting the November general election with mass mail-in voting.” 
     Now I’d like to highlight the Trump administration’s actions on telehealth, which the President detailed yesterday.  The President signed an executive order to make regulatory reforms, allowing for greater access to telehealth and toward making it permanent. 
     The Trump administration has cut red tape, allowing telehealth services for seniors and for other Americans.  Thirty-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries took advantage of the President’s reform, seeking telehealth services over the phone rather than through video conference.  A simpler and a smarter way to go about things is now available to Medicare beneficiaries. 
     The President also took executive action to boost rural healthcare services.  According to a 2019 study by Navigant, rural hospitals would be devastated by Medicare for All, otherwise known as government takeover of healthcare.  And under that analysis, they found that if Democrats had their way, 55 percent of rural hospitals or 1,037 hospitals across 46 states would be at high risk of closure. 
     The President’s executive order calls for strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure, which will expand telemedicine and rural broadband access.  Democrats seek to deny Americans their healthcare freedom, but President Trump is working hard to save your healthcare by guaranteeing protections for people with preexisting conditions, eliminating the highly unpopular individual mandate of Obamacare, stopping surprise medical billing, increasing transparency, and lowering drug prices. 
     President Trump will continue to work hard to enact these healthcare principles by requiring price transparency; allowing states to purchase drugs from other countries; and improving Medicare to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for seniors; and by ending surprise medical billing, and making companies compete for your business by providing more options and more affordable plans. 
     Lastly, later today, Advisor to the President, Ivanka — Senior Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump, will be joined by Attorney General Barr; Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Brooke Rollins; executives from organizations that combat human trafficking; and survivors from across the country for a roundtable to highlight newly awarded Department of Justice grants to provide safe, stable housing to survivors of human trafficking.
     DOJ will award over $35 million in Housing Assistance Grants for victims of human trafficking to provide supportive housing and appropriate services to survivors of human trafficking. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-4-2020/

5:36 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias.  It’s a very interesting name.  last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve issued emergency declarations to support a response in both of those areas.  So that’s Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
     This week, the storm passed just east of Florida.  Got a little bit lucky.  Didn’t hit Florida too hard.  Working with the governor, working with everybody.  But it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might.
     It’s currently off the coast of South Carolina, heading northward to North Carolina.  It’s expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a category 1 hurricane.  Very serious.  A lot of water.  A lot of water coming from that storm. 
     I’ve already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina.  And FEMA’S personnel — and they are great; they’re doing a job — they’re already on the ground in all areas.  Every single area that we mentioned is covered.
     Over the next several days, there’s expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey.  We’re working with each of those states, and in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement — all of the different groups that are involved.  Storm surge and inland flooding are possible, and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes.
     I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities.  We’re working with them.  And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far.  So stay safe.
     Next, let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus.  We’re beginning to see evidence of significant progress.  Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6 percent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 to 8 percent over that same period of time, an encouraging sign — very encouraging, I have to add — that the virus is receding.
     In hotspots across the South and West, we’ve seen slow improvements.  From their recent weekly peaks, Arizona’s weekly case counts have dropped 37 percent.  That’s a tremendous drop.  And the governor and the state have done a fantastic job.  Down 37 percent.  Texas down 18.7 percent.  I was there a couple of days ago.  And Florida, 21.2 percent drop.  So that’s a tremendous job that they’re all doing.
     As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare-ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri.  And I think you’ll find that they’re soon going to be very much under control.
     Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates.  Under 5 percent: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  It’s under five.
     Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful, in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those states.
     To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance; wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places; and to protect the elderly.  Very, very important — protect the elderly.  It’s much different.  Young children have very strong immune systems.  We’ve learned how strong they are.  But protect the elderly.  The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old.  That’s the average age.
     It’s important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward, and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent.
     As we’re seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging — you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough, invisible enemy — lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future.  They just don’t.  It comes back.  Many times, it comes back.  The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially as it respects to — with respect to hospitals; learn more about the disease; and develop effective treatments, as we did in the United States.  We’re doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics.
     Countries where there have been very significant flare-ups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan.  And also, as you probably heard, in Hong Kong, they’ve had some very serious flare-ups.  Japan has gone — yeah, a lot — a lot of six-fold — six-fold flare-up.  That’s a lot.  But they’ll get it under control.
     In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school, with careful precautions.  Ideally, we want to open those schools.  We want to open them. 
     At the same time, we’re placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment, and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine.  The vaccines are coming along incredibly well.
     Today I’d like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we’ve done.  We’re taking — really taking an increased interest, and we’re seeing numbers that nobody can even believe, in terms of percentage increase.  It’s telehealth for American patients.  The — the percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it’s very, very significant; numbers that you would not even think possible.
     This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA healthcare team.  And it worked out really well.  We have a 91 percent approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we’re doing.  This is the first — it’s the highest ever recorded.
     Now telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA, and it’s becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens.  You don’t have to go to the doctor’s office; you don’t have to go to hospitals. 
     When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience.  And really, they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes.
     Today I’m taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay.  Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent.  We’ve done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we’re doing on medicine and medical and what we’re doing.  They can do things that you wouldn’t believe, that even a year ago, two years ago would not have been doable.
     We’re enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient.  And very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you.
     The order builds upon a series of actions we’ve all taken to make telehealth available to all.  We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost.  That’s no additional cost.  And co-payments can be waived for telehealth services.
     We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices.  And I will tell you that the favored nations clause that I’ve signed into existence — nobody thought anybody would ever do that — has a massive impact on prescription drug prices, in addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, in particular prescription drugs. 
     But the favored nations clause is massive.  For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 10 cents a pill, as an example — just as an example — and the United States pays 2 dollars for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right as they do.  We never had that before.  We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development.  So the — the numbers are astronomical.  And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by big pharma.  Very big ads.  Very massive buy. 
     But in the meantime, they’re calling.  They want to know if they can make a deal.  And I say to people, “The only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you.”  And they understand that.  I think our people understand that. 
     But, in particular, when you look at the matching — you could call it “matching” or you could call it “favored nations” — call it whatever you like — it’s a tremendous — it’s going to have a tremendous — and I’m talking about 50, 60 percent, 70 percent.  That doesn’t mean it goes to 10 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up and ours goes down.  And you have many, many countries where their numbers — the numbers are so low.  I mean, so low.  And by that, I mean, much lower than the United States.
     Another thing I’m doing is if a certain country, like Canada — Canada buys for very much less than the United States has bought.  How they allowed this to happen — representatives of our country standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office — how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible. 
     We’ve been working on this for a long time.  I’ve been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right?  So now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida — who is doing a great job — or our great governor of Ohio or a great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50 percent less.  So we’ll be buying from Canada.
     Now, what the drug companies are going to do — maybe they’ll raise them, maybe they’ll lower them, or maybe they’ll just give up and sell them to us directly much cheaper.  So a lot of things are happening.
     Also, the rebate — we have people that are very wealthy that nobody ever heard of them.  Nobody knows who they are.  I guess, in some cases, they can be pharmacies; in some cases, they’re individuals.  We’re doing a rebate, and the rebate goes to the people.  It lowers the price of drugs.
     So we have a series of four things that we signed.  And you will see, over a period — a fairly short period — drug prices are going to be tumbling down at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible.
     We have — in 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration.  It was last year.  Fifty-one years it went up.  But that was just a small decline.  This is a massive decline.  This is a decline that nobody can believe.  I was called by senators, I was called by congressmen: “Please don’t do this.”  But big pharma doesn’t mean anything to me other than we want them to do a great job.  We want them to get their vaccines.  We want them to do what has to be done. 
     So I think you’re going to see drug price reductions over the next four or five or six months — it’ll probably take a little while to kick in — that are going to be at numbers that you wouldn’t believe.  But in the meantime — they called on Friday afternoon — they want to meet and see if they do something else.  They don’t like favored nations clauses.  I understand that.
     We vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services — through telehealth, by the way — including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority.  We brought the substance abuse — at least prior to the China plague, or whatever you want to call it — we brought it down very substantially.  Pediatric critical care and much more. 
     Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services.  So a very, very big priority on telehealth.  As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help healthcare providers and hospitals expand their telehealth.  And they’re all doing it.  They’re doing it gladly.
     Prior to the epidemic or the pandemic — whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it — but prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn’t anything raging.  And I guess one of the only good things that we’ve gotten out of this whole horrible situation is telehealth has been incredible.  And again, the increases are, you know, many hundreds of times greater than it was before.  Do you have a number?  It’s like 2,000 percent or something like that.  It’s an incredible — it’s an incredible increase.  You’ll get the number.  But it’s — it’s — I think they have it now finally, and it’s really an incredible — thank you, Kayleigh. 
     We worked with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus.  We cut red tape to allow many services to be conducted by phone, rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. Thirty-five percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone.  So you’re talking about 6-point — 3.6 million seniors.  That’s something.  10.1 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic.  So you’re talking there 10.1 million people.
     In April, over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than 0.1 percent in February.  Those are part of the numbers that I think — I’ll have you get them.  So this part, you don’t have to; you’ll get the other — the other section.  Thank you.
     So think of that: compared to less than 0.1 percent — 0.1 percent.  That’s an incredible number.  So over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to — so you went from 0.1 percent to 43 percent.  That’s an incredible — that’s an incredible number.
     The executive order I signed today will also expand healthcare access in rural America.  We take care of rural America.  It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure.  And we’re working very hard with all of the people in government that are involved with the communications infrastructure so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access. 
     Additionally, revenue for rural providers vary significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business.  Many, many are having a very difficult time.  To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility — really, great flexibility — and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients.
     Furthermore, I’m directing the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission — we were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium — to form a task force that will break down barriers to expanding rural healthcare.  This order continues my administration’s focus on rural healthcare. 
     We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas.  We allocated another $10 billion to 2,000 rural hospitals, and more than 2,400 rural health clinics.  We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time — and these are people that had great reputations and great track records — for practitioners that serve on the frontlines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients.
     We’re also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the state and local areas have the supplies they need.  We’ve been supplying hospitals and cities and states, governors — helping governors at a number that nobody has ever heard of before.  Fifteen thousand four hundred and forty nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment.  They’re very much stocked up; they’re in great shape.  They all have the ventilators — all the ventilators they need.  They have, actually, more than they need.  And their equipment — medical equipment is in very, very good shape.  They’re full.
     My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves, and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide.  We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we’ve been talking about together on vaccines and treatments. 
     Under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting — most exciting — last week, we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients.  Had great results.  This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia.  And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along.
     Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late-stage illness.  They’ve been very good.  We’re also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies, and that, we’re working on.  And that’s a brilliant art.  It’s really an art.  And we launched a national plasma drive last week — I was at the Red Cross building — with the American Red Cross and 13 other healthcare organizations.
     I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov — Coronavirus.gov — and donate plasma today.  We would really appreciate it.  This really makes people better.  But we need — what we need is we need that beautiful ingredient that you, that got better, seem to have in your — in your veins.  You have to go to Coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today.  It’ll be tremendous.  We really appreciate it if you do it, because we’re low.  We’re low.  We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing.  It’ll take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative.  Makes people better.  And, you know, you had something very special.  You had something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to use it.  So whatever you can do.  Coronavirus.gov.
     As a result of improvements we’ve made in treatment, for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85 percent from its April peak.  Eighty-five percent decline. 
     On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine.  One hundred million doses.  This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting.  We’re supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, who are having wonderful results, and they’re in final stages of testing. 
     There are now two vaccines in the — in that final stage of clinical trials in America, with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately.  And we have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies.  These are great companies.  These are companies that are not only well known, they’re well respected, most importantly.
     We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year.  And we’re mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we’re ready immediately upon approval.  We have our military lined up.  It’s logistics; it’s all about logistics.  They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers.  But now they’ll be doing vaccine.  Our general is all ready to go and he’s very excited.  And once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he’ll start the process.  They will start the process, and they’ll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond, if it works as we think it probably will.
     By unleashing America’s technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic and we will hopefully end it very quickly.  The therapeutics are very exciting to me — where you can go into a hospital, and whether it’s through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody and they get better.  That’s something, to me, that’s very important.  And we’re doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines. 
     So thank you all very much for being here.  We’ll take a couple of questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-3-2020/

10:54 A.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: Good morning, everyone. We’re going to begin with some brief remarks from Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and he’ll be giving you all an update on phase four negotiations.
MR. MEADOWS: Good morning. As you know, over the last several days, we’ve been having conversations on Capitol Hill, Secretary Mnuchin and myself, with Democrat and Republican leaders, both in the House and the Senate.
Last night, we concluded a meeting with Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi a little bit before 10 o’clock, and at the President’s direction, we have made no less than four different offers to Democrats on Capitol Hill on how we can make sure that the enhanced unemployment that is set to expire today, along with eviction protection that is set to expire as well, is protected. And those four different offers have been actually rejected, but more importantly than that, they’ve not even been countered with a proposal.
So the Democrats are certainly willing, today, to allow some of the American citizens who are struggling the most under this pandemic to go unprotected. And the President has been very clear for us to be aggressive and forward leaning to make sure that they get protected. And yet, what we’re seeing is politics as usual from Democrats up on Capitol Hill.
It surprises me that when we talk about compassion and caring about those that — that truly are in need, that a temporary solution to make sure that unemployment — enhanced unemployment continues has been rejected not once but multiple times.
The Democrats believe that they have all the cards on their side, and they’re willing to play those cards at the expense of those that are hurting. And we’ll continue on with additional discussions today with Senator Schumer and Senator — and Speaker Pelosi, perhaps an in-person meeting tomorrow on Capitol Hill, as we — we stay engaged.
But I’m — I’m disappointed. And what we’ve — what we’ve experienced over the last three days — and I want to stress that the Democrats have made zero offers over the last three days. Zero. And so, in a spirit of compromise, the President has sent us back not once, not twice, but three different times to try to find some common ground. And what we found from our Democrat negotiators is that they are bumping the price higher than the very bill that they passed out of the House several weeks ago.
And to give you a particular example of that is: In their HEROES bill, they have $100 billion for schools. We matched that offer and actually put forth a proposal for $105 billion for schools for K-through-12 and higher institutions. And yet, what did they say to that? “Oh, no, that was two months ago. We want to increase the amount of money that we send to schools to $400 billion.” We’re going in the wrong direction. They’re going in the wrong direction because of partisan politics. It is very disappointing.
And so we call on Capitol Hill to get serious about their negotiations. The President is serious about the negotiations. We’re willing to engage.
As you know, Leader McConnell, yesterday, put forth a one-week extension at the current level for enhanced unemployment. And what did we see? Senator Schumer objected to that. So there’s no clear message that the American people should receive, other than the fact that the Democrats are willing to pay — play politics at a critical time in our nation’s very dire circumstances as we deal with this pandemic.
So I wanted to give you that brief update so that you can have it straight from the negotiations, as they’ve happened over the last three days, and as we work.
I’m going to — I’m going to turn it over to — to the Press Secretary. And I think she’s prepared to answer all the questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-31-2020/

5:41 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.  Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain.  He was a very special person.  I got to know him very well.  And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus.  And we send our prayers to Herman’s great wife, Gloria.  Wonderful family. 
     And I have to say, America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy.  We mourn their loss, as a nation; we mourn their loss, as people — as people that love one another.  And we’re working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague — it’s what it is, is a plague — but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines.  And we’re making a lot of strides. 
     All over the world, they’re having tremendous problems.  A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well.  Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet — in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong — places where they thought it was — they had really done great.  It came back.  And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly. 
     The virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again.  So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that; you have to hold your statement. 
     Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times — that’s 35 times — in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few.  These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised.  Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections.  And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers — you have no idea what they might be.  And I can say “scarcity of testing.”  Almost anywhere, except for our country. 
     This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border states.  Meanwhile, states like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others — they were thought to be doing well, and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard. 
     And governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore.  They were held up as models to follow, and then they got hit and — now, I’m not even saying this is their fault.  It’s probably not their fault.  It’s just the way it is.  That’s the way it is.  Highly infectious — one of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen.  Not since 1917, over 100 years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we’re witnessing now. 
     But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound.  And, again, no one is immune.  No one is immune.  These facts illustrate the imposing determinant — and it is a determinant — that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country.  People are starting to understand the disease now.  We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn’t have any idea.  We didn’t — nobody ever saw anything like this. 
     The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity, and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality.  And we’ve done that.  But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it. 
     We did the right thing initially.  We saved millions of lives, what we did.  We did the right thing.  But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all.  A small shutdown of certain areas — but we don’t want to do that — small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time. 
     We understand what we’re dealing with now, but it’s a very complex situation.  And I can only say: Thank Heaven that we — that we are so advanced in what we’re doing, in terms of vaccines and therapies. 
     We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets.  Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population.  Think of it: Half of the deaths — really, a tremendous number — half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population, those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  The average age of those who die from the illness is 78. 
     We’ve announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable.  The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions. 
     I’m once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who’s elderly — especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses.  Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we’re discussing.  But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance, wear a mask if you cannot socially distance, and practice vigorous hygiene.
     Everyone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease.  The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected. 
     In the current hotspots across the Sun Belt, the data is showing very encouraging signs.  Arizona, in particular, has crossed an important threshold.  For every person with the virus, we’re now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected.  And the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially.  They’re starting to come down in Florida.  Arizona is really leading the way. 
     I was in Texas yesterday, and they’re starting to come down significantly, we believe, in Texas.  Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they’re coming down very significantly. 
     Earlier today, I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy — which is a tremendous — a tremendous thing that they’re looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it — potentially lifesaving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease. 
     More than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus, and today we’re asking them to visit Coronavirus.gov — Coronavirus.gov — and volunteer to donate plasma.  We need plasma.  It’s something that’s been very effective, and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do.  Most people do. 
     Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating.  We’ve secured over 90 percent of the world’s supply of remdesivir — which is terrific — an encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. 
     We’ve also approved the use of the widely-available steroid — which has been very successful — dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. 
     On July 17th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials — moving along very rapidly.  That’s Regeneron. 
     As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was just in April.  So in a very short period of time.  Think of that: Just 18 — 85 percent lower than it was in April.  It’s a big statement. 
     Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill.  Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers.  We love our American workers.  And we’ve set records on job creation — records — two months in a row. 
     We enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package.  The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs.  We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans.  We approved $500 billion for our hardest-hit industries — $500 billion. 
     We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties.  It was a big thing, a very big thing. 
     We also suspended student loan payments for six months, and we’re looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time. 
     As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record 7 million jobs in the two months past alone. 
     To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will — we had a great foundation to build on.  We were the strongest country in the world; nobody close.  We were outdoing everybody from China.  If you remember, for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States.  Well, it didn’t.  We gained on them very significantly.  We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen — 2019, and we’ll be back there very shortly.  It won’t take very long, based on everything that we’re seeing.  It’s not going to take very long.  I think next year is going to be an excellent year — maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint. 
     We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost, and we never will.  We’ll never forget them; never forget what happened.  This could have been stopped in China.  They should have stopped it, and they didn’t.
     But I’m asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need.  First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits.  This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.  This was not anybody’s fault.  From the standpoint of jobs, it happened — a terrible thing happened.  Could’ve been stopped.  It happened.
     I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today — in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I’m surprised at — because this is great for our country and it’s great for our workers, and it wasn’t our workers’ fault.  
     Second, we’re asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions.  We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments.  We don’t want that to happen.
     Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program.  This money will help millions of hardworking families get by.
     My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen.  Children are not [sic] at the lowest risk.  If you look at what’s going on: the younger, the better.  Amazing — the immune system.  For children, the lower they are in age, the lower the risk, in terms of the age group itself. 
     I tell the story that, in New Jersey, with thousands and thousands of people dying — sadly, dying — the governor was telling me that only one — Phil Murphy — only one died under the age of 18.  That’s incredible.  Where thousands of people that died in the state of New Jersey, one made an impact; one died under the age of 18.
     Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus.  Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our nation’s children.  We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family.  We have to remember that there’s another side to this: Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also.  Economic harm, but it’s causing death for different reasons.  But death — probably more death.
     If governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice.  So we say if a school doesn’t want to open or if a governor doesn’t want to open — maybe for a political reason and maybe not, but there is some of that going on — the money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. 
     If schools stay closed, the money should follow the students so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters — about their children.
     But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party.  They have tremendous voices.  They’re looking at November 3rd.  And probably a day later, they’ll say, “Let’s open up the country.” 
     But the Democrats have to reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it’s going right now.  We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of states that you thought were doing pretty poorly, from the standpoint of the virus, and they’re actually coming back very strong. 
     This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first.  I got elected on the fact that I put America first. 
     For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last.  If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we’ve watched for many years destroy our country — NAFTA, we terminated it.  We have USMCA now, which is a great deal, and our farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic.  But we put America first, America’s families first, and America’s workers first.
     But that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future.  We’ve cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations.  And we’ve cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country.
     Americans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before.

5:20 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Today my administration has taken a momentous step toward achieving American pharmaceutical independence — a very, very big, big step — a focus of our campaign to bring America’s critical supply chains and medical manufacturing back to the USA.  We’ve been working on this for a long time.
This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus.  It should have never happened.  It should have never been here.  They should have stopped it.
In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States.  Millions of jobs were vacuumed out — just taken out so easily.  Our politicians let that happen.  And our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases, to China and all over the world — countries all over the world.
Nearly four years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home where they belong.  When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security.  We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America’s medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs.
I just want to say that Pfizer just announced, a little while ago, that they’re combining phase two and phase three trials, and the vaccine looks like it’s really heading in a very rapid direction, in a very positive direction.  First time that’s happened.  And they’re many months ahead of any other trial.  There’s never been anything like it.  So it’s the fastest ever, and to me, it’s very exciting.
Today, I’m proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries.  My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company — you remember this company; it’s called — from the good, old camera age, the old days — to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients.  It’s called Kodak.  And it’s going to be right here in America.
So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak.  They’ve been working very hard.  Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now — Rochester, New York — a good place.  And they’re trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal, and they will be announcing this deal.
I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives.  We’ve worked really well together on this deal.  It’s a big deal.  It’s going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak.
Ninety percent of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs.  We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration, by far.  Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less.
Yet, in less than 10 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs — they’re currently manufactured in America — more than 50 percent, however, are made in India and China.  And you’ll be seeing — a lot of things have happened.  It’s been happening, but it’s happening at a more rapid pace right now.
With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals.  It’s a great name, when you think of it.  Such a great name.  It was one of the great brands in the world.  Then people went digital, and Kodak didn’t follow.  But now, under very extraordinary leadership, they are following and they’re doing something that’s a different field, and it’s a field that they’ve really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company — watching over it.  But it’s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States.
Under this contract, our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act — remember when you were saying I didn’t use it enough, I didn’t use it enough?  And now you heard it’s the 33rd use.  We don’t talk about it all the time; we used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren’t doing as we were asking them to do, and it came through as both a threat and a usage.  But this is our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act.
Kodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal.  Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe.  We’ll be competitive with almost all countries, and soon with all countries.
Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we’ve opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25 percent of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the USA.  That’s a big number: 25 percent.
This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak’s factory in Rochester; that’s just in the initial phase.  And in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well and it’s a great place — and I’m very happy that we’re able to help them with the problems that they’ve had recently.  And the National Guard — I want to thank the National Guard, both state and beyond.  I want to thank them for the incredible job.  They went in and they did some beautiful job.  They cleaned it up.  You didn’t hear about the problems anymore.
And indirectly, I want to create — we created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains.  We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain — not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also.  I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible.
Today’s action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history.  We’ll be able to do that.
Through the Defense Production Act and other authorities, we have invested more than $3 billion in our nation’s industrial base.  We’ve contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year — nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year.
We’ve contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase U.S. production of N95 masks.  And we’ve brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we’ll have 160 million in a very short while — 160 million a month.  That’s many times what we used to do.  If you go back two years ago, it’s many, many times.
We’re increasing domestic production of gloves by 1,000 percent.  It’s 1,000 percent.  We will be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year.
We’re finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric.  We have 13 million reusable gowns in the Stockpile, and we’ll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed.
We made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests.  So we have — there’s nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max.  And we’re already at about a 50 percent level, and we’re bringing it up very substantially from there.
We’re growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month.  There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close.
Through our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing and the state of Maine — a great state — we’ve increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now.  As you remember, I went to Maine; I went to the plant where they do this.  It was incredible.  It was a great experience.  And we’ll produce over 100 million swabs per month by January.
We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter.  So we’ll have 500 million doses.  And, logistically, we’re using our military, our great military — a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations — and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly.  They’re all mobilized.  It’s been fully set up.
A very, very talented general is in charge.  And when we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of.  It’ll be a very — a very rapid process all over the country.  And perhaps we’ll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we, all of a sudden, have become very good at making.
When the China virus struck our nation, we mobilized the entire government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies.  HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns.  That’s a lot of gowns.
Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States.  Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens.  As you know, that’s where we want to take care — we have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem — in particular, heart or diabetes.  Which provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million mask — masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns.
We have replenished the long-neglected National Stockpile.  In January, the Stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks.  Today, the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we’ll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number.
We’ve shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we have more than 75,000 available to deploy.  Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator.  And if you remember, early on when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by, and now we’re the largest maker anywhere in the world, by far.  And not only are we fully supplied and stocked, but we’re helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get.
This is just the beginning.  In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history.  We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world’s premier medical manufacturer and supplier.  That’s what’s happening already.  It’s been happening now for quite some time.
We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots.  You can look at large portions of our country; it’s — it’s corona-free.  But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida.  It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon.  But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it’s starting to head down.
In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on.
And we, as you know, have done a excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse where they wanted to burn it down.  They’re anarchists.  Nothing short of anarchists, agitators.  And we have protected it very powerfully.  And if we didn’t go there, I will tell you, you wouldn’t have a courthouse.  You’d have a — you’d have a billion-dollar burned-out building.
We’re also working aggressively to combat the virus and Native American and Alaska Native communities.  Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in tribal communities, and we’ve worked very hard with tribal communities.  They’re very vulnerable to this horrible plague.  It’s the largest investment in Indian Country in U.S. history.  There’s never been an investment that big in Indian Country.
We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease.  It’s critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk — and, in fact, some are in — some age groups are at an extraordinary low risk themselves — they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk.
I ask all Americans, regardless of background or age, to practice social distancing — which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it; remain vigilant about hygiene; avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars; and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate.
Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before.
We’re looking at a very powerful year next year, economically.  The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly; set records.  The numbers on retail — retail sales — came in two weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country.  So we look like we’re heading to some very, very good economic times; that means jobs, that means stock market.
The stock market is already doing very well.  It’s getting to a point very close to where it was when we had this — when we were hit with the — the plague.  So I just want to thank everybody for being here.
Steve, please.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-july-28-2020/

3:33 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great to be in this wonderful state.  So many friends, so much success, and we love being here.  And we’re here, actually, today to discuss the exciting progress that we’ve achieved under the Operation Warp Speed — our historic initiative to develop, test, manufacture, and deliver a vaccine in record time.  And that’s what it is, in record time.  Likewise, therapeutically, we are very, very advanced.  You’re hearing about it and you’ll be hearing about it a lot more in the next two weeks.  We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing America’s scientific genius, which is what it is.
I’m therefore proud to announce that this morning, the Moderna vaccine has officially entered phase three already.  And that’s phase three clinical trials: the final stage before approval.  There’s never been anything like this, in terms of speed — nothing even close.  A second vaccine is likely to enter phase three in a matter of days.  Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve shaved years off of the time that it takes to develop a vaccine — in some cases, many years — and we’ve done it while maintaining the FDA gold standard for safety.  This is the fastest a vaccine for a novel pathogen has ever gone.  It has never gone like this.  And if you look at where we are, by phase three, we could say “ever gone by far.”
Four additional promising candidates are expected to enter final trials in the coming weeks, including the Novavax vaccine being developed right here at this facility.  It’s an incredible facility.  We’re going to be making a tour in a little while — a very, very complete tour — with the folks that run it and the people that operate.
We’ve just completed a tour of Fujifilm’s innovation laboratories — and that’s going to be done at a much, much higher level in a few minutes after I’m finished, and I believe we’ll take a few questions too — which were carrying out a crucial biomanufacturing process needed to make the Novavax vaccine.  This production is made possible by my administration’s $1.6 billion award to Novavax as part of Operation Warp Speed.  It lets us deliver the final product in a time that never has been achieved anywhere, at any time, for anything like this.
These same manufacturing processes are being conducted on an even larger scale in College Station, Texas.  Today, I’m proud to announce that HHS has just signed a $265 million contract with the Fujifilm-Texas A&M Innovation Center, which is quite the place, to dramatically expand their vaccine manufacturing capacity.  I want to thank Fujifilm CEO Martin Meeson for welcoming us today.  And Martin — where is, Martin?  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Martin.  It’s really wonderful to be with you under these circumstances in particular, with all the progress that’s being made.  As well as Novavax CEO, Stanley Erck.  Stanley, thank you very much.  Thank you very much for being here.
Thanks also to Secretary Alex Azar, who is with us; Senator Thom Tillis, thank you very much.  Thank you, Thom.  Stand up, Thom.  Good job you’ve done.  Thank you very much.  You really have.  Representatives Richard Hudson, David Rouzer, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Greg Murphey, thank you.  All friends.  All warriors.  Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who I hear is doing a great job — where is Dan?  Stand up, Dan.  Great job, Dan.  Really good.  North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore — thank you, Tim.  Great job.  And President pro tem of the North Carolina State Senate, Phil Berger.  Thank you, Phil, very much.  I appreciate it.
Operation Warp Speed is funding a historic portfolio of highly promising vaccine candidates.  In addition to our $1.6 billion investment in Novavax, we’ve issued a $483 million contract with Moderna, a $1.2 billion contract with AstraZeneca, a $465 million contract with Janssen, and just last week, a $1.95 billion agreement with Pfizer.  Tremendous progress is being made with all of those great companies.
A groundbreaking agreement with Pfizer includes a guarantee to deliver 100 million doses shortly after the vaccine’s approval — almost immediately — with the option to purchase an additional 500 million thereafter.  Not only is Operation Warp Speed accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery.  Nothing has happened like this since the end of World War Two.
Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously.  So everything goes at one time.  We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting; it’s all going at one time.  We have a system that has — I think it’s unparalleled.  Never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work, and work very well.
We’re mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that it’s approved, it’ll be available to the American people immediately.  And we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.  The world is suffering from this China virus.
Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus.  Over 140 clinical trials are underway, and a number of effective therapies have already been developed and widely delivered, including remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact — you see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically — dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, and antibody treatments.  We have numerous treatments right now that are under study, and I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that.
On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials.  Late stage.
Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was in April — think of that: 85 percent — and is 25 percent lower than Europe as a whole.
In the middle of April, more than 22 percent of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus.  As the last week, that number has dropped down — as of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7 percent.
To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing — very important.  In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together.  They’re pooled.  Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than — substantially more than 50 percent.
Last week, our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began distributing rapid point-of-care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.
What we’ve already sent includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point-of-care tests.  It’s a tremendous amount.  That’s — you’ll get your response and answer from 5 to 15 minutes.
Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point-of-care tests.  Think of that.  The United States has conducted over 52 million tests.  That’s more than all of Europe put together, times two.  Nobody is even close.  And as countries go, it is — as an example, India is up to 11 million tests.  We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests.  India has 1.4 billion people.
Through our relentless efforts, we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill.  The cupboards were bare.  I say it often.  In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100 million N95 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face shields, and much, much more.  In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month, and we’re distributing them — we have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need.  Other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus.
Last week, FEMA sent additional personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves, and 6 million gowns.  It’s a lot.
Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas, and Arizona held steady and are now heading down.  In Arizona, they’re heading very substantially down, and rapidly.  We’ve been constant — and in constant communication with the states, and are surging them resources when requested.  They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately.  We are totally full, we have everything we need, we get it to the states immediately, we deal with the governors.  The relationship with the governors has been very good.
These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly.  We are working with every governor and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendations.  States are different.
My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections, by far.  Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America, however, the region’s reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted.  And I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world.  We report our cases; most of the world doesn’t.  They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick, or they just don’t report it.
Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly infected countries outside of our borders.
I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott — terrific gentleman — and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas.  We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people.  We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators, and half a million KN90 masks.
Beginning this week, Texas hospitals will receive 500 cases of remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients.
In addition to the cross-border spread, this stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease but can spread the disease.  We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance.
I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars, and wear masks when appropriate.
We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk, which are, in most cases, in many cases, the elderly — especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes.  But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus especially — especially those that are really targeted — almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic, pandemic.
America will develop a vaccine very soon, and we will defeat the virus.  We will have it delivered in record time.  As our visit here demonstrates — and I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina.  This is a great — this is a great place.  It’s a phenomenal place.  And we’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time.
I want to drive the — the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible.  When they call them there, when they call — most of them, many of them are sitting here right now — I will always answer their call.
So thank you very much.  I appreciate you being here with us.  And let’s get on to a few questions.  Tremendous progress has been made, and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before.
So, please.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-covid-19/

597,Trump,2020-07-27 09:24:00+00:00,Remarks by Vice President Pence and Governor DeSantis of Florida in a Press Briefing on COVID-19,Nan,"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine
Miami, Florida
2:24 P.M. EDT
DR. FORD:  Well, good afternoon.  Mr. Vice President, Commissioner Hahn, Governor DeSantis, Governor — Congressman Díaz-Balart, other distinguished guests: It is truly a distinct honor and pleasure to extend a heartfelt welcome to you, to the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.
I’d like to thank each of you for your continued support, partnership, and tireless effort as we navigate the impact of COVID-19 on our community, the university, and our health system.
As I mentioned to the Vice President earlier, he could not have picked a better place to mark the start of the phase three COVID-19 vaccination trials.  The Miller School of Medicine was Florida’s very first medical school and is now home to South Florida’s first and only NCI-designated cancer center.
And the Gordon Center, where we are today, is one of the crown jewels of the university.  It is the home of the first cardiopulmonary simulator for medical education, named Harvey, and that structure has helped train tens of thousands of learners worldwide and continue to do so today.
And as an institution whose overarching mission and singular focus is to be at the forefront of advances in clinical care, medical education, and translational medicine to improve the health of our nation, we are pleased to host you, Mr. Vice President, your first visit to a phase three clinical trial site in the nation.
It is now my pleasure to introduce our governor and a great friend of the University of Miami, Ron DeSantis.
GOVERNOR DESANTIS:  Well, thank you, Dean.  In Florida, we had an interesting situation with our budget.  The budget was completed basically right before the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” was announced.  And so it was done in a financial situation that obviously changed dramatically.  We waited until the end of the fiscal year to consider that budget, but the budget vetoes that I had to issue were historic: a billion dollars.  I likened it to the Red Wedding version of line-item vetoes.
But even though we had to take off so much off the budget, we were able to support the Sylvester Cancer Center here at the University of Miami.  And I think that that’s a testament to, in one of the toughest years, to be able to be there.  It’s a testament to the great work that’s being done here across the board and with these clinical trials.  It’s even been more exciting.
I want to thank the Vice President.  Vice President Pence has been a great friend of the people of Florida.  He was down here, I remember, early on when we met at the terminal with the cruise — the cruise ship executives, and he’s been down multiple times, always willing to lend a helping hand.  And I’ll tell you, it’s been beneficial.
We’re encouraged by the most recent trends.  Yesterday, hospital admissions in the state of Florida for COVID-like illness was the lowest it’s been since June.  Emergency department visits for COVID-like illness yesterday was as low as it’s been since the middle of June.
And Florida’s case fatality rate is about 1.3 percent.  It’s one of the lowest case fatality rates in the country amongst large states.  And part of the reason is some of the great work that our medical professionals are doing here at the University of Miami Health System.  I learned in our roundtable: For admitted hospital patients with COVID, their fatality rate is 10 percent of the admitted hospital patients.  That is incredibly great results with a very difficult disease.  So I really want to thank the folks here who’ve been doing a great job saving lives and generating good patient outcomes.
Part of the reason I think people have also generated better outcomes is some of the therapeutics that have been developed, including this new therapeutic, remdesivir.  This was sent out to states a month or two ago when there was a more demand signal.  As more patients were coming into Miami hospitals, we needed to accelerate those shipments.  I called the Vice President, and I think, like, 48 hours later, it was all arriving at the hospitals across the state.
We’ve had to change the schedule to accelerate to make sure there was no gaps, and the White House has been there every time.  So I want to thank them for what they’ve done to be able to help our physicians have the remdesivir that they need to treat their patients.
And then, finally, I’m really excited that the federal government is sending point-of-care COVID diagnostic tests to nursing homes all across the country.  And as many of you know, we’ve had no visitations in nursing homes since middle of March.  It was the right thing to do.  We’ve done routine daily screening of staffing.  We’re doing bi-weekly testing of staff.  We’ve tested all the residents.  You know, we’ve obviously prohibited hospitals from sending COVID-positive residents back to nursing homes.  It’s been a big focus.  We sent millions of PPE — masks, face shields, all this other stuff.
But we haven’t been able to figure out, okay, when can they be able to see their loved ones.  It’s a tough balance.  But I think with this point-of-care test, you will be able to potentially have the visitation resume, where the family members can be tested, get an answer in 15 minutes, and then you get to go make that human connection.
And all the steps we take, there’s always costs on the other side, and we’ve done a lot to protect our nursing home residents.  I think our fatality rate there is testament to that.  But that has come at an emotional cost; it’s increased loneliness.  And we can’t just do that indefinitely.  This is a way to maintain the safety and still work to keep the virus out of these very vulnerable areas while still giving people some personal nourishment and having the families connect again.
So, Mr. Vice President, thank you for being a part of that.  We look forward to those landing in nursing homes throughout the state of Florida.  We want to thank you again for all you’ve done to help us amongst — along these many difficult months, but I do think that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and a lot of that is due to your support.  So, thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Well, good afternoon.  I want to thank Governor Ron DeSantis and his entire team for the seamless partnership that they’ve forged with our administration since the early days of this pandemic.  We’ve worked together to ensure that Florida had the resources to do testing, that your hospital systems and incredible healthcare workers had PPE, ventilators.  And we’ve also been — we’ve also been working to make those therapeutics, like remdesivir, available in increasing measure.
But today is a historic day, because today, here at the University of Miami, we will begin the first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine in the United States.
Eighty-nine sites all across America, with more than 30,000 participants, will be a part of this phase three clinical trial.  But coming here to the University of Miami, to be able to partner with you, Dean Ford, and the entire team here is a great privilege.
And President Trump wanted me to be here — wanted me to be here, first and foremost, to say to the people of Florida that we are with you.  We’ll stay with you every step of the way.
We’re encouraged by the favorable trends here in Florida, but we’ll continue to make sure your healthcare workers have the resources to provide the level of care that any one of us would want a family member to be able to have: the level of care that’s been being delivered here at the University of Miami hospital system every day during the challenging days through which you have just passed.
But today is a day of hope.  Today is a day of promise.  And today is a day, I think, that — that is a tribute to American ingenuity and to President Trump’s relentless drive toward achieving medicines and a vaccine for the American people.
It’s remarkable to think that the company that will begin phase three today, a company known as Moderna, actually was the first company in America to begin phase one clinical trials back in the month of March.  And as Dr. Stephen Hahn of the FDA may reflect in just a moment, that was in record time.  Literally, it would just be a matter of weeks from when the United States first received the coding for the coronavirus that we were able to initiate an effort to develop a vaccine.  And in 62 days, a period of time never heard of in vaccine development, we were able to go to phase one trial.
But today, here in Florida, we begin the first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine, and we begin it — we begin it in a spirit of the same urgency and the same hopefulness from which it began.
We have moved, at President Trump’s direction, at a historic pace.  But as Dr. Hahn will also reflect, we are going to ensure that we move at a safe and effective pace.  And I want to assure the people of Florida and people all across this country that we will cut no corners in the development of this or any vaccine.
We’re truly grateful for the support of members of Congress in both political parties that have made more than $10 billion available.  I want to thank Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart, who is with us today, as well as the Florida delegation to the House and the Senate for their support.
Because it’s important to note that under Operation Warp Speed, we’re not even waiting to the end of clinical trials to create the vaccines.  Whether it be Moderna or it was announced last week with Pfizer, we’re actually having these companies produce the vaccines as we speak.  And as soon as they are confirmed to be safe and effective, we’ll have tens of millions of doses able to distribute across the country.  It is that initiative, the President launched in Operation Warp Speed that is a reflection of our commitment to bring these medicines, to bring a vaccine to the American people just as soon as we can responsibly do it.
But let me say — let me say thank you again to just a few more folks.  I want to thank Governor Ron DeSantis and his entire team for your leadership during the trying days through which Florida has just passed and throughout this pandemic.  It is a — it is a tribute to Governor DeSantis’s professionalism and to his heart that, from very early on, Florida has leaned into this effort.  And I particularly would commend the Governor’s efforts to look after seniors who we’ve known from the beginning — seniors with serious underlying health conditions — represented the most vulnerable to serious outcomes.  And it was efforts here in Florida that really — really became a model for long-term care around the country.  And we’ll continue, as the Governor said, to support those efforts in the days ahead.
I want to thank the University of Miami not just for being the site of the first phase three clinical trial, but just as much, Dean Ford and your team here, for everything that you’ve done throughout this pandemic and in the difficult weeks through which Florida has just passed.  To have a separate COVID-only hospital to be able to continue to operate your hospital for all the other healthcare needs in the community is a tribute to the innovation and effectiveness of the doctors and nurses and all the healthcare workers in this extraordinary facility.
Finally, I want to say thank you to all of those who’ve agreed to participate in this clinical trial.  It is remarkable to think 30,000 Americans were willing to step forward and to participate in this phase three clinical trial, and they have our thanks.  People who have volunteered to participate in this and other trials are doing more than their fair share to help our nation through this challenging time, and they have our thanks.
For anyone looking on who would like to be a part of either this clinical trial or other clinical trials for therapeutics or for vaccines, you can go to ClinicalTrials.gov and be a part.  That’s ClinicalTrials.gov, and you can get information on how you can participate.
But we all have a role to play.  And we all know that each and every one of us, by practicing good hygiene, washing our hands, wearing a mask every time that state and local authorities indicate it’s appropriate, or wearing a mask when you can’t properly socially distance is how each of us can play a role.  But for those Americans, literally more than 100,000 who have stepped forward and volunteered to participate in clinical trials around the country, you have our thanks as well.
Today, I said, is a great day in America.  The first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine begins here in Florida and in 89 different sites around the country.  And it begins with the best professionalism of our pharmaceutical companies in this country.  American innovation, American creativity begins with the hopes and, I know, the prayers of the American people.
And I’m convinced more than ever on this great day that we’ll get through this.  And we will reach that day, I truly believe, as Dr. Fauci said not long ago, when “if” not — or not “if,” but “when” we will have a vaccine, we’ll have it available to distribute to tens of millions of Americans.  And we’ll reach that day when we finally can begin to put this coronavirus in the past.
So with that, I’m going to turn it over to Dr. Stephen Hahn for his remarks and then — and then, really, one of the — one of the leaders of the clinical effort here at the University of Miami, and we’ll take a few questions.
Dr. Hahn?
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Dean Ford, and Dr. Doblecki-Lewis.  Thank you for hosting us today.  In the early part of this pandemic, President Trump and Vice President Pence asked FDA to make sure that we removed any unnecessary barriers to the development of medical products, and we have followed that request.
Today, we are seeing the initiation of the first phase three clinical trial of a vaccine candidate.  And that is, as to the Vice President said, a historic event in an incredibly short period of time.
I want to thank my colleagues — my medical colleagues who are in the frontline taking care of patients, but also who put together this clinical trial and are helping to enroll patients, and ensuring that it’s done in the absolute highest-quality way.
It is a true sign of America’s great biomedical research enterprise that we find ourselves here today.  Normally, this process would take months and years.  And it’s to the dedication of great medical professionals and researchers that we’ve gotten to this point.
Conducting clinical trials are a crucial piece of our efforts to approve a vaccine for COVID-19.  FDA has oversight over a number of clinical trials for both therapeutics and vaccines — in fact, over 140 — with more than 450 therapeutics in the pipeline.  And I want to thank, like the Vice President did, the Americans who have stepped forward to volunteer for these trials, because they are our true heroes as we evaluate the efficacy and safety of a vaccine.
Now, the important scientific data that we will get from the phrase three clinical trials — and this is, of course, one clinical trial that we’re going to see, but several others are planning to go to phase three in the next several weeks — and the data that come from those clinical trials will allow FDA to do its important work to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective.
And we’re doing everything we can at FDA to support that development by providing regulatory and scientific advice, as well as technical assistance for how to conduct those clinical trials; the number of people that need to be in those clinical trials so that we can have confidence in the data; as well as to make sure that there’s diversity in the clinical trial population, because what we want is to have generalizability of those results to the entire United States population.
As I mentioned, we expect a number of additional trials to go into phase three in the next several weeks to months, and that’s good news for the American people.
As we laid out in our guidance regarding vaccines and in all of our actions to COVID-19, FDA scientists will not cut corners in order to evaluate a medical product, and that includes a vaccine.  And I know that our colleagues performing these clinical trials want to have and must have confidence that we will do that as we evaluate the data that they generate for that vaccine.
It’s these scientists who will call the balls and strikes on approving a vaccine, and they will make their decisions based upon the data and science that’s generated from these clinical trials.  We will authorize or approve a vaccine solely on the basis of the data that we receive in the determination of safety and efficacy.
So I really appreciate the leadership of the University of Miami and other investigators around the country.  Again, it’s the truly great American research enterprise that allows us to get to this point, and Americans can have confidence in FDA that we will make the absolute best decision on their behalf.
Thank you.
DR. DOBLECKI-LEWIS:  Good afternoon.  I’m Susanne Doblecki-Lewis.  I’m the site principal investigator for the University of Miami site for the Coronavirus Prevention Network and for the first phase three clinical trial of that network, which is the Moderna vaccine trial.
We’re incredibly excited to begin this process here at the University of Miami, and we are really amazed and humbled by the number of volunteers who have already stepped forward to be a part of this trial.  And it’s these volunteers, as the others said, who will make the difference and will allow us to know whether we do have an effective and safe vaccine that can move forward.
Here at the University of Miami, we are very aware of the need to shape our enrollment to reflect our strength, which is the diversity of our population here, and particularly the diversity of people who are at high risk for COVID-19.  So we take that mandate very seriously, and we’ll plan to enroll 1,000 patients here; 500 will get the vaccine and 500 will get placebo.
We’ll follow those patients very carefully for two years after the second injection of the vaccine.  The vaccine consists of two injections, phased 28 days apart.  And we’ll be following extremely carefully, checking for any symptoms of potential COVID disease, and performing follow-up swabs and assessments to make sure that we completely understand the efficacy of the vaccine.
So we’re very, very happy to be at this point, and optimistic and looking forward to beginning our enrollment here.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor.  Questions?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-governor-desantis-florida-press-briefing-covid-19/

1:36 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  The first duty of government is to protect the safety of our citizens.  That’s what Attorney General Barr said when he was here at the White House just a few days ago.  For 55 days in Portland, Oregon, we’ve seen lawlessness, anarchy, and destruction that threatens peace in our streets and the safety of our fellow American citizens and the safety of our brave law enforcement officers.
Yet some Democrats and some in the media continue to ignore reality.  As Portland’s — Portland’s Democrat Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted, quote, “What I saw last night was powerful in many ways.  I listened, heard, and stood with [the] protesters. And I saw what it means when the federal government unleashes paramilitary forces against its own people.”  That was a quote from the Democrat mayor who quite literally stood in the middle of a riot as violent protestors attacked a federal building.  That is appalling, and Mayor Wheeler is clearly failing at his duty to protect his streets and his city there in Portland.
The federal government has a sworn duty to uphold the laws of the United States through field offices and federal facilities across the country.  These agents protect and serve the American people.  Yet the rhetoric of the left undermines our justice system, with Nancy Pelosi calling them “stormtroopers,” Jim Clyburn calling them the “Gestapo,” and Wheeler using the term “paramilitary forces.”
Under President Trump, violent crime rates in America finally began to fall.  Rhetoric like this cannot be allowed to set us back.  Augmenting the Federal Protective Service, guarding federal property in Portland, our brave officers have — since — since augmenting them, I should say, our brave officers have faced all of these various things — like rioters barricading officers inside the Hatfield federal courthouse, trapping officers inside.  A, quote, “commercial-grade mortar firework” was launched by rioters.  A federal agents hand was impaled by planted nails.  Another federal agent was shot with a pellet gun, leaving a wound deep to the bone.  And tragically, three federal officers were likely left permanently blinded by the rioters using lasers pointed directly at their eyes.
These are not the actions of so-called peaceful protesters, and the Trump administration will not stand by and allow anarchy in our streets.  Law and order will prevail.
And I have a short video for you because I want it to be real what is happening right now in Portland.  So if we could play that video, that’d be great.
(A video clip is played.)
As you can see, that is anything but a peaceful protest.  And this President will always stand on the side of law and order.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-072420/

5:25 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
We’ve had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus.  I have reminded people of the importance of masks when you can’t socially distance, in particular.  A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places.
Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents.  We’re working very hard on that.  We’re doing very well all over the country.  And also about contracting with Pfizer — we made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer.  We think they’re very close — but we have a lot of companies that are very close — to produce a vaccine.
And I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you: This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida.  It’s a place I love.  I love that state.  The drawings look absolutely beautiful.  I never thought we could have something look so good, so fast with everything going on.  And everything was going well — a tremendous list of speakers; thousands of people wanting to be there — and I mean, in some cases, desperately be there.  They wanted to attend.  People making travel arrangements all over the country; they wanted to be there.  The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line.
But I looked at my team, and I said, “The timing for this event is not right.  It’s just not right with what’s happened recently — the flare up in Florida — to have a big convention.  It’s not the right time.”
It’s really something that, for me — I have to protect the American people.  That’s what I’ve always done.  That’s what I always will do.  That’s what I’m about.
They said, “Sir, we can make this work very easily.  We have great enthusiasm.  Incredible enthusiasm.  Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they’ve seen.  We can do this safely, and we can do it responsibly.”
And I said, “There’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that’s from the China virus or the radical-left mob that you see in Portland” — where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days.  They went in, and people were out of control for 51 days — a long time.  And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in, and they’ve done a great job protecting our property — the federal courthouse and other property — and, most importantly, protecting our people.  Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit — a lot of other cities where so many people are shot, and so many people are killed.  And people elected me to help and to protect.
So, I told my team, “It’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention.”  We’ll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday, as has always been planned.  We were never taking that off.  That’s remaining as it is.  The delegates are going to get together.  That’s where they do their nomination.  So, the delegates are going to North Carolina, and they’ll be doing the nomination.  And we’re going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online — the week that we’re discussing, which will be really good.  I think we’re going to do it well.  And I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won’t do a big, crowded convention per se.  It’s just not the right time for that.
I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country — and even in the world — who would be coming into the state, and I don’t want to do anything to upset it.  They’ll be doing very well very shortly.  We’re going to put some maps up of the country behind me, and you’ll see that the area that we’re talking about is a hotspot.  You will also see a lot of the country is — has no problem whatsoever — most of the country, actually.  So I’m always going to take care of you, so that that’s the way we’re going to do it.
I’ve spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders.  I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and its great mayor.  He’s a great — great guy.  Really great guy.  They wanted it so badly.  And all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida.  And just very special people — a very special group.  And they were there for us, 100 percent.
Today, I want to provide an update on the actions we’re taking to support the safe reopening of America’s schools.  Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they’re essential to our children’s future.  Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high-risk factors can continue to participate from home.  Very important.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.  It said, quote:
    “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in [a] social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical [and] sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation.  This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.  Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been [a] substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and [for] families.”
So, that’s very important, and there’s a highway — it goes both ways.
The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.”  Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important.
One study estimates that, due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35 percent behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50 percent behind in math.  That’s a big statement.
According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income black and Hispanic students.  They’re the ones that are hit the hardest.  We don’t want that happening.
Thirty million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals.  Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools.  According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly, having to do with child abuse, they have neglect — and these are neglect and neglected cases are submitted by education personnel.  So people in the education world, on the premises, will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children.  They know if they’ve been neglected.  They know if they’ve been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it’s at home or someplace else.  But they see this at school.  You don’t get to see that if you’re not going to school.  It’s a big thing.
Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus, very substantially.  When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare.  Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions.  Ninety-nine percent of all China virus hospitalizations are adults.  And 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults.  That means that children are a tiny percentage — less than 1 percent, and even a small percentage of 1 percent.
In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to the coronavirus.  Many different names.  Many, many different names.
The life of every child is sacred and must be protected.  Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America’s children.
I have a very, very special person who loves children, who is — who is, I think, one of the greatest athletes of all time.  A lot of people say “the greatest pitcher of all time.”  Known as a “relief pitcher” who could have been whatever he wanted.  Some people — he is the greatest reliever of all time, by far.  Substantially more saves than anybody else.  In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently.
And he — I’m reading off these stats.  I knew he was the best.  I knew he was great, but I didn’t know it was almost double anybody else.  But he’s a man who loves children — has children, loves children, works hard with children.  We’re going to go outside and be with some little leaguers.  Mariano Rivera — you know, he’s the “Sandman,” right?  My wife said, “Darling, why do they call him the ‘Sandman’?”  I said, “You know, they play the song.  He just puts the batters to sleep.”  And that’s exactly what happened.
So, having Mariano here is a great honor.  Thank you very much.  He was talking about children in schools.  And there’s nobody that’s done more than you have.  Thank you very much, Mariano.  Fantastic man.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and to protect students.  And we do have to protect the teachers and the families also; we have to remember that.
All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance.  This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at high risk.
In cities or states that are current hotspots — and you’ll see that in the map behind me — districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks, and that’s possible.  That’ll be up to governors.  The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community, but every district should be actively making preparations to open.
Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours.  They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem.  So, it’s pretty amazing actually.  Great, great credit.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide.  As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk — much lower, in the case of young children — to resume work and school and — as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing.  We want that.
A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms.  We don’t want to do that.
At the same time, we have to get our economy going.  We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday.  Housing prices — pricing of housing up 21 percent.  It’s the highest in history.  It’s the highest number in history.  Real estate housing went up 21 percent.
Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely.  I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions.  This isn’t about politics; it’s about something very, very important.  This is not about politics.  I even think it’s bad politics if you do the wrong decision.  Very bad politics.
We’re asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill.  This funding will support mitigation measures, such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aides, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing, and crucially, mask-wearing.  This money is in addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year.  That money we have; some is distributed, and some is not distributed.
If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.  The key word being “choice.”  If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions.  So we’d like the money to go to the parents of the student.  This way, they can make the decision that’s best for them.
We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school — harming their mental, physical, and emotional development.  Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families.
The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year.  That’s a tremendous problem.  It’s a tremendous problem.  Schools have to open safely, but they have to open.
More than a dozen European countries — as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others — have already reopened schools, and cases have not risen.  We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.
We’ll continue to support states and cities in the current hotspots in the South, Southwest, and West.  The governors — I know them all.  They’re all very, very capable.  They’re doing a very good job.  They’re working so hard.  You wouldn’t even believe it.
We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance.  We’re helping with doctors and nurses — medical personnel of all kinds.  As a PPE update, we’re in close communication with governors and states.
We have supplies — everything they could possibly need.  We’re very strong on supplies.  Remember I used to say the cupboards were bare?  Well, now the cupboards are the opposite.
Due to our historic efforts to increase both the National Stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days’ worth of supplies on hand.  And most importantly, they have ventilators — because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past.  Now we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them, in many cases, to other countries.
For states that are making requests, we’re rapidly delivering.  In the last 24 hours, FEMA has deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000 — well, let me change that.  We’ve created about 600,000 different supplies.  We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington.  I think the number is 600.  We’ll go check that, and we’ll give it you in a little while.  But we’ve — we’ve got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators.  I think we’ve sent out about 600 just recently.
The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world, by far.  Roughly half of the tests are either the rapid, point-of- care tests, which, frankly, solves a lot of problem in delay — 5 to 15 minutes, instead of waiting for service both ways, in both directions, and then at the lab.  But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are 5- to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day — in some cases, immediately.
We’re continuing to surge testing to current ho- — hotspots, such as Miami and Phoenix, to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further.
This is a copy of the map, and this is a — you have it right behind me.  That’s really very much indicating where the problems are.  You see from — from that, it’s in great shape — lots of it.  The Northeast has become very clean.  The country is in very good shape, other than if you look South and West — some problems.  That will all work out.
On therapies: We’ve worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of remdesivir are arriving this week.  That’s a lot.  That’s a really — that’s a lot.  They’re working around the clock to make it.  It’s had a tremendous impact.  We’ve also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks.  Arizona is doing very well; it’s heading down.  The numbers are heading down, I think, very quickly.  The governor has done a great job.  They’ve all done a great job.  They’ve all done a great job.  Working hard.
We’ll continue to monitor the areas rising and — with respect to cases.  And we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation — this horrible disease that was sent to us by China.
It should not have been sent.  They should have stopped it.  They could have stopped it.  They didn’t.  And the entire world has gotten infected, and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now.
This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they’re going through a very hard time with this — in Moscow, in particular.  I spoke to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.  They’re doing well, but they’re going through a lot.  Everybody is going through a lot.
Yesterday, I spoke to the heads of four different countries.  All four are going through a lot.  They’re going through a hard time.
This could have been stopped.  It could have been stopped quickly and easily.  But for some reason, it wasn’t, and we’ll figure out what that reason was.
So, with that, if you have any questions — please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072320/

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room


5:50 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today, my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval.  Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly.  And we think we have a winner there.  We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well on the vaccines — long ahead of schedule.
As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter.  This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time — really a very small fraction of the time, based on previous schedules.  I want to thank the FDA.  I want to thank everybody involved.  It’s been an incredible process.
As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens, as we all know.  The median age for those who die from the virus is 78 years old, and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.  That’s really something.
In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1 percent of the U.S. population.  So think of that: less than 1 percent, half of the fatalities.  So we know what to look for.
From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors.  In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities.  And we gave it a very strong priority.  FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it’s going directly to 15,400 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified nursing homes throughout the country.
Today, I’d like to provide an update on the additional actions we’ve been able to take, and they’ve been very constructive.  First, we’re requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in states where you had the worst outbreaks.  All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We’re distributing 15,000 rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices to support this effort.  These are the tests where it takes five minutes to fifteen minutes.  They’re very accurate. They’re very good.  And we’re sending them all over the country.  And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities.
Second, HHS will be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes.  Nursing homes in higher-risk areas will be receiving more funding.  This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing, and providing technology support so residents can connect their families and they can connect to their families.  They are having a tremendous time.  They want to be with their loved ones.  They can’t do it, so what we’re doing is we’re working it so that we can connect — have them connect with their families if they’re not able to visit.
Third, we’ve been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the governors, so that the governors and their staffs can take appropriate action.  We’re able to find — because of the testing programs and other means, we’re able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The governors can then take action.
Additionally, CMS, CDC, and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest-risk nursing homes.  And that’s their priority right now: nursing homes, but the highest-risk nursing homes.
CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most.  And we have them surveyed, and we have them mostly pinpointed.
Over the past few months, we’ve created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks.  And currently, 99 percent of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it, so we have great data.  When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert the state and make sure that it responds very quickly.  We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly.
I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life.  We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope.  The light is starting to shine.  We will get there very quickly.  But we send our love; we send a message of love — very important.  We’re with you all the way.
As far as the outbreak in the Sun Belt, I said yesterday: We continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the South and Southwest and the West.  We’re closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida.  Arizona is starting to come down.  Done a very good job.  They’re all doing a good job.  They’re very talented people.
There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections.  Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations — which you know very well about — which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide.  And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places — maybe beaches — four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide — likely also contributed.
We’re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately.  I was with the President, and it’s a big problem for Mexico.  But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Two hundred and fifty-seven miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great, positive impact on people coming in.  And we have record-low numbers of people coming in illegally; that’s helped greatly.  It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we’re doing right now and for the pandemic.
Nationwide, beyond the outbreak in several states, cases remain low and very stable.  Nineteen states have positive test rates of less than 5 percent.  Eight states have positive test rates of less than 2 percent.  Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8 percent, compared to over 16 percent at its peak in April.  It’s coming down.  It’s coming down fairly rapidly.
Today, we surpassed — first time — we surpassed 50 million tests.  That’s far more than any country in the world.  India is second, we believe.  We think — 1.4 billion people; that’s about 12 million tests.  We have 50 million tests.
We’re working with every state to ensure the supply of remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill.  We’re working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes — everybody.  The remdesivir has proven to be terrific.  Our case fatality rate continues to decline, and we want to push this rate even lower.
The therapeutic research continues daily on new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use of blood thinners and steroids.  A lot of different things are happening, and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn’t have known a number of months ago.  We’re doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines.
And, frankly, therapeutically — or maybe a word even beyond that word is “cure” — would be the best of all, and we’ll see what happens.  But that would be great if we could go into the hospital, and just cure people.  And we’re at a position we’re actually able to — to a certain extent, with what we have right now.  And we think, in a very short period of time, we’ll be able to do that.
Our strategy is to shelter the highest-risk Americans, while allowing younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant.  Wear a mask, socially distance, and repeatedly wash your hands.  Practice very, very good sanitary means.  You have to do this.  You have to just — you have to look at it differently.  Wash your hands often.  I’m finding more and more people are saying, “Wash your hands.”  So wash your hands.  We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.
And we’re all in this together.  And as Americans, we’re going to get this complete.  We’re going to do it properly.  We’ve been doing it properly.  Sections of the country come up that we didn’t anticipate — for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera — but we’re working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it’s all going to work out, and it is working out.
So, with that, I’ll take a few questions, please.  Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072220/

University of South Carolina
Columbia, South Carolina
1:37 P.M. EDT
GOVERNOR MCMASTER:  I’d like to welcome everyone here to the University of South Carolina.  This is where we’ve had many of our meetings concerning the pandemic.  And we’ve gotten a lot of great ideas in this place, and we got some more today.  We appreciate very much the effort of the Vice President, Secretary, the Administrator, and coming here and being with us, as well as Superintendent.
And we look forward very much to your questions.
Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Well, thank you, Governor McMaster.  I want to thank you and First Lady Peggy for the hospitality today.  Karen and I are honored to be here with you, grateful for your strong and steadfast leadership throughout this pandemic.  And as we see cases rising across South Carolina, on behalf of the President and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, Governor McMaster, I want to thank you for the seamless partnership that we have forged on behalf of the health and wellbeing of the people of South Carolina.
But with rising cases here in the state, the President wanted me to be here today with a very simple message for the people of South Carolina, and that is: We are with you.  And we’re going to work closely with your governor and with all your state health officials to make sure that the people of this state have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and the therapeutics, and the supplies to meet this moment.
And, Governor, I — again, I want to — I want to thank you for organizing the discussions that we had today.  I mean, having the opportunity to meet with your health team, to hear your perspective on what’s happening on the ground in South Carolina, and the great efforts that healthcare workers are making all across this state and the great cooperation of the people of South Carolina, I know that we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together.
President Trump will be briefing the nation later today on our administration’s efforts, working with states, particularly across the Sun Belt, with the — in midst of rising cases.  But let me just say a few words about our response.
As, Governor, you know with — the rise in cases across the Sun Belt is serious, but the people of South Carolina should know that we are in a much better place to respond to this pandemic across the south than we were two and three months ago.
But because of the partnership we’ve forged with your governor, with governors around the country; because of the whole-of-America response that President Trump initiated that has taken testing to nearly 50 million tests having been performed across the country; the development of hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment; over 100,000 ventilators being constructed in 100 days; and the rapid development of therapeutics, whether it be remdesivir or convalescent plasma, or others that are under active consideration at the FDA — that, combined with the Operation Warp Speed’s development of vaccines, we are leaning into this effort and we are — we are in a much better place to make sure that your governor and your healthcare providers in this state have the support and resources, but to provide any member of your family with the level of healthcare that we would want for a member of our family.
We’re proud of what South Carolina has accomplished.  Governor, I think, in March, you were performing roughly 540 tests per day; now nearly 10,000 tests a day.  And — and I also want to commend you, Governor, for the efforts you’ve made protecting the most vulnerable.
From very early on, we’ve recognized that seniors with serious underlying health conditions represent those most vulnerable to the coronavirus.  And to that end, Seema Verma, in a few moments, will detail a plan that we unveiled last week building on our efforts to focus resources and measures and standards on nursing homes.  We announced last week that the federal government will be distributing point-of-care tests — 15-minute tests — to all 15,400 nursing homes in America, beginning at the end of this week.  And Seema Verma, with the Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services, will describe that.
With regard to supplies: I’m informed, Governor, that as of July 9th, FEMA and HHS have delivered to South Carolina
nearly a half a million surgical masks, not including nearly 400,000 N95 respirators, tens of thousands of face shields and coveralls.  And we’ve also made certain that you will continue to have the ventilators here in South Carolina that are — that are needed for people facing the most serious consequences.
Seema Verma will also talk for a moment about healthcare capacity.  We are monitoring healthcare capacity across the Sun Belt.  And while there are instances where some hospitals in states that are being impacted by rising cases, there are instances where individual hospitals are beginning to reach capacity.
The report that we received today here in South Carolina and all across the Sun Belt is that overall hospital capacity remains strong, hospital beds are available.  But we launched a new website this week to make sure that hospitals are giving us real-time information so that we can continue to work with states to make sure that that remains the case and that hospitals have the supply that they need.
But beyond all of that — and we’re focused on saving lives, protecting our most vulnerable, but as we discussed today, we’re also focused on reopening America: opening up America again and opening up America’s schools.  And, Governor, I want to — I want to commend you for your steady efforts to put the people of South Carolina back to work.  I’m informed that more than 105,000 South Carolinians have joined or rejoined the workforce in the month of June, and your unemployment rate in this state has dropped from over 12 percent to just under 9 percent.
I think the American people and people across this state realize that when it comes to a choice between dealing with the pandemic or opening up America, it’s not an either/or; we can do both.  We all have a role to play.  All of us need to do our part to practice personal hygiene, wash our hands, wear a mask wherever state or local authorities determine it’s indicated or where the social distancing is not possible.
But, Governor, you’re proving here in South Carolina that you can put this economy back to work.  And you’ve already unveiled a plan to reopen schools across South Carolina, and that was much of what our discussion was today.
And on behalf of the President and our entire task force, I want to thank you.  I want to thank you for leading the way on getting our kids back in the classroom.  We heard today from education leaders from across this state, and I was — I was deeply inspired by the words that I heard.
In just a few moments, I’ll yield the podium to the Superintendent of Anderson School District Five.  Superintendent Tom Wilson today reflected very memorably on the academic impact on children, especially children who are struggling learning how to read.  The reality is that the — that without getting our kids back into school this fall, children that are struggling academically, children that are struggling with learning how to read will fall farther and farther behind with long-term consequences on their academic future and needs.
Also, I was deeply moved today to hear from Janie Neeley, the mother of a special needs 4-year-old by the name of Marsh.  Marsh has Down’s syndrome.  And Janie spoke very eloquently about — about the fact that Marsh misses his friends.  He misses his teachers.  He misses the counseling that he receives as special needs students do uniquely in schools around this country.
And so, Governor McMaster, we commend you for your efforts to get our kids back into school.  And we commend President Caslen’s efforts to reopen the University of South Carolina.  We understand we don’t want our kids to fall behind academically, as Superintendent Wilson reflected, but also, it’s so important to recognize — whether it’s special needs, whether it’s nutrition needs, whether it’s counseling for emotional needs — millions and millions of children across this country rely on services that are only available at their schools.
And so for the sake of their academic wellbeing, for the sake of their personal wellbeing, Governor, you recognized today, as your team did, that it’s vitally important that we reopen our schools.
It’s also: To reopen the American economy, we got to reopen our schools.  It’s — the reality is that for working parents, working moms and dads, there is a great hardship in children not returning to school.  I heard a statistic on the way here that that less than 25 percent of single parents are able to telework, which puts a great, great burden on their ability to both be a parent and also provide for their family.
In hearing all that good counsel today, I just reiterated to the governor that we’re going to continue to provide the resources and the guidance so that states like South Carolina can safely reopen schools, as you reopen your economy and deal with rising cases across this state.
I’m pleased to report, with a grateful nod to your congressional delegation, especially Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, that we’ve already secured more than $30 billion in funding for states: $13 billion for elementary and secondary education, and more than $14 for higher education.  And I know, Governor, you just made an announcement about the distribution of those resources to school systems and universities here in South Carolina.
I’ll also pledge to you that our team is on Capitol Hill today negotiating and discussing a phase four of our recovery and relief legislation.  And the President made it clear to our negotiators yesterday that we want education funding to be a centerpiece of any additional recovery efforts by the Congress of the United States.  And so more help is on the way, Governor, and we’re going to continue to support your efforts and efforts across this country to get our kids back to school.
And finally, we’ll continue to give additional guidance. From early March, the Centers for Disease Control has issued consistent guidance for schools, providing additional tools for operating schools safely.
And in the days ahead, the CDC will be issuing additional decision-making tools for parents and guardians, preparing K-12 school administrators for a safe return in the fall, and limitations and considerations on symptom screening and the like.  That guidance will be forthcoming in the days ahead, and we look forward to providing that to you, as well as to all the great education leaders all across this state.
Finally, let me just say to the people of South Carolina what I said in the beginning — is that on behalf of the President of the United States and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force: We’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you every step of the way until we put this coronavirus in the past.  We’re going to continue to partner — partner with the — with your governor and with all your health officials and your hospitals to make sure our healthcare workers have the support and the supplies that they need to render healthcare to anyone impacted by the coronavirus.  And we’re going to continue to work — continue to work in ways that can open up the state’s economy again and get our kids back into school.
But we all do have a role to play.  We can slow the spread. We can flatten the curve.  We can save lives.  What we saw when this pandemic first struck our country was that with the full cooperation of the American people, with the full support of our healthcare workers, we can accomplish those things.  We did it in the Greater New York City area; we did it in New Orleans and Michigan, and other places.  We have every confidence that with the full cooperation the American people, the dedication of our healthcare workers, with the strong leadership of administrations like yours, Governor McMaster, that we will do it again in the Sun Belt.
But I do want to encourage each one of your citizens, as I said before, to heed local guidance when it comes to wearing a mask or where — or just wear a mask when social distancing is not possible.  Wash your hands.  Practice — practice personal hygiene.  Each one of us has a role to play, and we’ll get through this, I know, by putting the health of our neighbors first, looking after the future of our economy, looking after the future of our kids, getting our schools back open again.  And we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this together.
With that, I’m going to recognize the Secretary of Education for a report, and the Director of the — of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
But before that, I ask the Superintendent, Tom Wilson, of Anderson School District 5 to share a few of his thoughts on just how important it is that schools in South Carolina reopen, and maybe to reflect for a few moments on the plan that they’ve announced to get kids back in the classroom in school district 5 starting on September the eighth.
Superintendent.
SUPERINTENDENT WILSON:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Governor McMaster.  I shared with the panel a few moments ago our plans to reopen schools in Anderson School District 5.  We will open September the 8th.  We will give parents a choice of face-to-face or a virtual academy that’s being developed, where they can — we’ve been surveying our parents.  We believe we’ll have about 20 percent of our parents choose to do that, but it is a choice of the parents.  At the semester break in January, they’ll have the possibility come back to face-to-face, if they so desire, and hopefully the spread will be somewhat flattened at that point.
I think what resonated with the group a few moments ago was what I want to share with you: As of March the 16th, all the schools in this state were closed.  And Anderson School District 5, we were way ahead of everybody because we had developed it. We were the first school district in the state to have e-learning.  We piloted e-learning.  And other districts followed us, and we mentored other districts.
And we invested millions and millions of dollars in technology, Chromebooks — from kindergarten to 12th grade — digital integration specialists, fix-it people to keep things up and running.
E-learning — and you might hear the word “remote learning,” “e-learning,” different terms — it was never intended for 25 percent of the school year for kids to be out of school.  It was intended, in this state, for three or four days, when we had to call school off for snow.  But we were the best of a bad lot because we were the best at e-learning, and, still, it was very successful for a lot of students, but it was not successful for a lot of students, primarily the poor, the low income, single parents.
And the difficulty we had is when mom or dad has to be at Electrolux making refrigerators at 7:00 a.m. — they cannot telework.  Teleworking is really, quite honestly, a professional opportunity for professional staff.  They can’t.  They have to work.  They work with their hands.  They build things.
And as a result, we had a lot of kids who had very little support.  Our research tells us that if a child has a ineffective teacher for two years in a row, the chances of them graduating from high school is basically slim to none.  If they have no teacher for two years in a row, I assure you they will not graduate.  And what keeps me up at night are those kids that left us on March the 16th that were kindergarteners, first graders, second graders, third graders, fourth, and maybe even fifth graders, that were struggling readers.
And I dare say there may be a few people in this room that could teach somebody how to read.  I can’t.  I’ve been doing — I’ve been in public schools for 44 years; been a principal teacher, superintendent.  I ca- — I don’t know how to teach your child to read.  That’s not my — I wasn’t trained.  Teaching reading is a science and it’s also an art, and it has to be done at the shoulder of a child, for most children.
And so what I worry about are those struggling readers.  If we don’t get them back face to face with a teacher, six, seven years from now, eight years from now, we’re going to see a dropout rate like we’ve never seen, because kids drop out of school because they find it irrelevant and boring.  And when they get on up in where they can drop out, then they’ll quit and they won’t graduate.  And all of us in this room and all of us in this state and all of us in this country are going to pay the burden and pay the price for that, because what will happen: We’ll continue to put more people on the train and less people pulling it.  And those of us that are pulling, and everybody in this room, it will cost us more because they will never be able to get it.
Those of you who have little children: We can teach a 5-year-old Spanish like that, but try to teach it to a 40-year- old or a 25-year-old; it’s very difficult.
So, reading is essential.  That’s crucial.  I worry about the elementary a lot more than a high school.  I told our teachers, our principals: The tip of the spear is our elementary teachers because that’s where — that — that’s where the battle will be won.  And we look forward to doing that.
I commend the Governor for his support of opening schools, and we’re going to do it.  And we look forward to getting back.  We look forward to working with our virtual academy.  And it’s been an honor to be with you today, Governor, Vice President.  And thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great words, Tom.  Thank you.
Betsy.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President.  It’s really a privilege to be here with you in South Carolina today.  Governor McMaster, thank you so much for hosting us and for your leadership here in the Palmetto State.  And, Superintendent Wilson, thank you for so clearly articulating how imperative it is that kids be able to get back to school this fall.
I really resonated also, in the previous session, with what Dr. Caslen said.  And he said, “As South Carolina’s flagship university, I believe that we bear the responsibility to open our doors to students, most of whom are eager to resume their education in person and on campus.”  We must get schools back open, and we know we can do it safely.  The science on this is clear, and it’s only growing stronger.  It’s critical to students’ health and wellbeing.  It isn’t a question of health versus safety; it’s a question of health versus health.  Students need access to the services they receive at school.  They need to be with their teachers and their friends and they need to be learning and growing.  Thanks to the President’s leadership, we’ve made sure the needed resources are there to make it happen safely.
South Carolina’s K-12 schools have already received $126 million under the CARES Act.  But we know — also know that for too many students, especially the most disadvantaged, they might — may not have the right option for them and their families right now, or their assigned school may just be refusing to open.
And I think of what mom Janie Neeley said in the previous session about the need for her son, Marsh, to have that in-person experience with teachers and with students.  And I think also about Principal Akis [sic] Ross — Akil Ross, who talked about the imperative to be focusing on what students need and doing the right thing for students.
I want to applaud again Governor McMaster for the leadership he’s shown in supporting all students.  These Safe Access to Flexible Education, or SAFE, grants he announced yesterday will ensure that a student’s personal and family circumstances don’t limit them from accessing the best education possible.  This is a model, frankly, that the nation should follow.  It’s the President’s vision for every American student and why he’s fighting to pass school choice now.
We know that Congress is looking at how to best provide more relief, and this administration is going to fight for every student to go back to school safely and at a school that will best meet their unique needs.
When the assigned schools fail to rise to the challenge, we believe students and parents deserve a choice to go somewhere else, and the tax dollars meant to support their students’ education should go with them, not to a system.
So with that, again, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your leadership, and I look forward to continuing to work to ensure all students can get back to their learning safely and promptly.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thanks.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  And thank you, Governor, for hosting us today.  It’s a pleasure to be here, and appreciate all of your strong efforts on opening schools.
You know, one of the things with the Medicaid program that I run is that we provide a lot of healthcare services inside the schools.  Kids get vision services, they get screenings, immunizations.  And so it’s not only part of their learning; these healthcare services are important to their health, but also for their ability to learn.  So, really appreciate your efforts to open the schools.
When the pandemic started, the President and the Vice President were very clear on our mission: protecting the vulnerable and making sure that healthcare workers on the frontlines had what they needed to fight this battle.
And so let me start with nursing homes.  That’s our — one of our most vulnerable populations.  We know that nursing homes have been hit hard, but also, for the residents, it’s been an extraordinarily difficult time.  They’ve been separated from their families, haven’t had a chance to visit, and then many times, they’re restricted inside the room.  So it’s been a very difficult time, but we appreciate all of the strong leadership, especially at the state level.
We asked states at the very beginning to do inspections across the board of their nursing homes.  Almost 97 percent of those have been completed in South Carolina.  And the President has also wanted to make sure that nursing homes have the tools that they needed.  FEMA has been sending supplies directly to nursing homes.  We’ve also made grants available to nursing homes so that they can buy iPads and computers so that their residents can communicate with their loved ones.
And more recently, as we’re opening up, we want to make sure that nursing homes have the continued focused on testing.  We’ve asked that they test their resident — at least do a one-time pass.  And also, for their healthcare workers, that they do that testing on a weekly basis.
And we announced last week that we’re going to be providing point-of-care tests inside the nursing home to every nursing home across the country — that’s over 15,400 nursing homes — and that’s going to allow them to do rapid testing, get those results back in 15 minutes.  They can identify staff that have been impacted and also make sure that residents that are — that are sick and those — and separate the ones that are sick from those that are not.  And so that’s going to be a critical effort.
It also relieves the testing as some of the — it relieves the system, in terms of the testing capacity.  If nursing homes can do that inside their nursing home, then that relieves the labs from being able to test more people.  So that’s really critical as well.
And then, finally, it’s also that path forward for patients, residents to be united with their families, because that point-of-care testing could also enable visitors.  So we’re very excited about that.  We think this is going to be very important for our nursing homes.
And also, one of the other things that we’re doing with our nursing homes across the country is making sure that they have the support.  We’ve engaged our quality improvement organizations to go inside nursing homes.  So once inspectors have identified problems, we’re actually putting organizations on the ground to provide them the support, answer any questions, and make sure that they have a safe environment for residents.
The other piece that the Vice President mentioned today was the HHS Protect system.  And we announced this week that we are putting up a system which allows our hospitals to directly report information to HHS.  And they — the type of information that they’re reporting are their inpatient beds, their ICU capacity.  That gives us the ability to make sure that they have the supplies that they need, whether it’s remdesivir, whether it’s N95 masks.
Us understanding what’s going on in the hospital, in terms of their capacity, the patients they’re seeing, is so critical.  And we appreciate the hospitals across the country that have voluntarily provided that data to us.  And it’s just so critical to making sure that those healthcare heroes that are on the frontlines have the supplies and the support that they need.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Great.

5:10 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, and good afternoon.  Today, I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control.  It seems largely in Sun Belt but could be spreading.
My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package.  We’re working very hard on it.  We’re making a lot of progress.  I also know that both sides want to get it done.  We’ll call it “phase four.”  I think we’re going to get it done.  We’ll protect our workers, our schools, and our families, and protect them very strongly.
As one family, we mourn every precious life that’s been lost.  I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus.  We’re doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development.  But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders.  The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave.
My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important.  We’ve learned so much about this disease.  And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them.
And again, the vaccines are coming, and they’re coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years.  If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years.
The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we’ve learned a great deal about it and who it targets.  We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful.  We’ve developed them as we go along.  Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well.  It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better — something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.  It’s the way — it’s what we have.  If you look over the world, it’s all over the world, and it tends to do that.
The governors are working very, very hard, and we are supporting them 100 percent.  Everything they need, they get.  And we are taking good care.  We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it’s ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need.  So that’s a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards.
The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old.  Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care.  In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it’s heart or diabetes, but usually it’s some kind of a condition.  It seems that people have that.  And if they do, it’s a problem — no question about it.
Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms.  They won’t even know they’re sick.  They won’t have any idea that they have a virus.  They won’t have any idea at all.
America’s youth will act responsibly, and we’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask.  Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.  They’ll have an effect.  And we need everything we can get.
Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk.  99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults.  Think of that. So that’s much, much, much less than 1 percent for children, young people.
By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we’ve been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States.  In fact, we’ll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world.  We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment.  And we have many more happening and coming out.
We’ve learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we’ve shared them all over the world.  The relationship with other countries has been very strong.  We’re all working together.  This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment, including high-flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators.
And when you’re on a ventilator, we’ve learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator.  And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators.  But the doctors have become incredibly — and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure.
And allocating remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization.  And that’s something that they’ve really started.  They’re using it much earlier.  Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April.  It’s a great number.
As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit states, which you’re looking at right now, we’re surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics.  We again have tremendous amounts of supplies.  We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly.
Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world.  If you watch American television, you’d think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus.  Well, the world is suffering very badly.  But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they’ve been suffering from this virus for a long time.
We’ve done much better than most.  And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it’s something that we can talk about, but we’re working, again, with them because we’re helping a lot of countries that people don’t even know about.  I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators.  They need help with ventilators; they have to get them.  They’re very hard to get.  We’re making thousands now a month — thousands of ventilators a month.  It’s been quite amazing.
We keep doing the good job, and things will get better and better.  We’ll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success and, I guess you could say also, things that we can do better on.  But you’ll see them.  There’ll be put up as we go.
In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old.  Today, the average age is significantly younger.  Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April.  So the stays are about half.  The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced.  And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one half of what it was in April.
We’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it.  The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators but in many other things.  And things are happening too, like the remdesivir and other elements, steroids, et cetera.
But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus.  And that’s what we have — we have a relentless focus.  And it’s been that way from the beginning.  But we have learned so much.
As you know, in recent weeks we’ve seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our south — if you look at South, Southwest, and West.  This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18- to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic.
We’re also facing the challenge of a significant spice[spike] in virus cases across the rest of the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico.  Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard.  As you know, the president, a great gentleman, was here two weeks ago.  And they have really been hit hard.
Because we’ve achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in two months, we’re successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases.  Some cases so mild that you really don’t even treat them.  Some cases with children, where they don’t even know that they’re ill.  And I guess they’re not very ill because they recover almost immediately.
Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50 percent more tests than Europe, and we’ve conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the Western Hemisphere combined.  We’ll be over 50 million tests.  This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms.  So we know exactly where it’s going and when it’s going to be there.
We’re also working to reduce turnaround time.  My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt, and we continue to do so, working very close with all governors, but right now, in particular, those governors.
We’re coordinating closely with hospitals and governors.  In the last three weeks, I’ve sent senior officials into nine states to meet with governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the state, including hospital administrators, et cetera.
My administration currently has zero unfilled requests for — unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the governors.  No governor needs anything right now, and we think we’ll have it that way until the end, because, frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go.
We have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that’s helping us greatly.  I want to thank them very much.  The military has been fantastic.
We’re closely monitoring hospital capacity in these states.  Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures.  So hospitals are open for elective surgeries.
We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need.  All of the governors we’ve spoken with say they have enough bed capacity.  That’s a great thing.  Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators.
And a permanent shutdown was really never an option.  In terms of what we’re doing right now, this would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences.  There are consequences to shutdowns.
And we’ve saved, potentially, millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown, but now we’re very aware of this disease.  We understand the disease, to a large extent.  Nobody is going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we’ll end up with a cure, we’ll end up with therapeutics, we’ll end up with a vaccine very soon — all three.
We’re instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene — wash your hands every chance you get — while sheltering high-risk populations.  We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.  Be safe and be smart.
We’re surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases.  This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the South.  We’re being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes, because you know all of the problems that we’ve had with so many people — so sadly, they were infected — so that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else.  That’s really the high-risk people — the high-risk, wonderful people.
Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference.  Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic but to end it.  We want to get rid of it as soon as we can.  That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority.
Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month.  This was achieved in record time.  It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now.  Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks, and we’re mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately.
And logistically, we have the military ready to go.  We have great people — logistic, military people.  A wonderful general who’s waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time.  That’s what’s going to happen.  So our military is all set to go.  We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is that’s necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all.
And I’ll take a few questions if you’d like.
I will say this: I want to thank all of the staff — the White House staff, all of the doctors that we’ve been working with so closely.  And just a lot of very positive things are happening.  It’s a nasty, horrible disease that should’ve never been allowed to escape China, but it did.  And it infected the world, and the world is suffering.  But we’re going to get it taken care of, and we’re helping lots of other countries.

11:16 A.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good morning, everyone.  By any objective standard, the violence, chaos, and anarchy in Portland is unacceptable, yet Democrats continue to put politics above peace while this President seeks to restore law and order.
Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat — Governor of Oregon — said that the President should, quote, “stop playing politics,” called law enforcement officers “secret police,” and likened it to, quote, a “dictatorship.”  The governor also called on the president to get his officers off the streets.
Democrat mayor of Portland, Todd Wheeler, said the President is “trying to look strong for his base” while you had Democrats on the Hill, Nancy Pelosi, calling these officers stormtroopers and Jim Clyburn calling them the Gestapo.
This rhetoric is unhelpful and gives the violence we have seen a pass.  But President Trump will not give the violence a pass.  He will restore order where the Democrat governor and the Democrat mayor are unwilling to admit that they have lost control of their city.
The well-organized mob in Portland has become increasingly aggressive, especially against law enforcement officers. Individuals have thrown bricks, chunks of concrete, glass bottles, feces, balloons filled with paint, pig’s feet, slingshots to hurl ball bearings and batteries at federal agents and the courthouse.
Multiple attempts to barricade officers in the Hatfield Courthouse have occurred; attempts to start the structure on fire as well.  Use of eyesight-damaging laser devices have been used, and strobe lights against federal agents as well.  But according to Speaker Pelosi, when asked about the violent removal of statues, “people will do what they do.”
The Trump administration urges state and local officials to work cooperatively to restore law and order.  Operation LeGend is a great example of this.  At the governor’s request, we went into Kansas City and surged the area with federal assets — FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals.  This was named after LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old young boy who lost his life and was shot in his bed tragically.
This has been a successful operation that has been waged in his name, including the arrest of wanted fugitives.  Similarly, President Trump is taking action in Portland, even though you have a Democrat mayor and Democrat governor unwilling to work with us in this situation.  We are surging resources, along with Secretary Wolf at DHS, and augmenting the Federal Protective Service to safeguard federal property.
The bottom line is that this President stands with law and order, which leads to peace.  And we will not allow Portland to become the new CHOP, like what we saw in Seattle.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

2:30 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This afternoon, President Trump will deliver remarks on rolling back regulations to help all Americans.  Deregulation has been a top priority of this President.  The President reversed the disastrous over-regulation of the Obama-Biden administration.  Under President Trump, seven deregulatory actions have been taken for every one new regulation.  This amounted to $50 billion in regulatory cost savings.
And it is important to note that this deregu- — deregulation agenda lowers costs for every American.  The cost of these burdensome regulations fall disproportionately and benefit disproportionately lower-income Americans.  So this President took action to roll back the burdensome regulations that harm low-income communities and make sure that these lower-income Americans are taken care of.
For example, the President’s deregulatory agenda will boost household income by $3,100 annually.  Thanks to President Trump’s rolling back of the Obama-Biden-era CAFE standards, family — families will have access to cheaper cars.  The President’s healthcare deregulation will also save patients nearly 10 percent on prescription drug costs.
These real wins for the American people will disappear with a re-regulation agenda, which is why President Trump will continue to pursue his historic deregulatory activity.
On another note: We saw encouraging news yesterday on vaccines.  Moderna’s vaccine candidate is showing promising signs.  They produced a positive, neutral immune response among the 45 participants in the study.  This is comparable to what we see in recovered patients.  And the bottom line is that, so far, we are seeing exactly what you would hope to see in a vaccine.   They’re expected — the Moderna vaccine in particular is expected to reach phase three by late July, with 30,000 participants
And finally, on the therapeutics front, I just want to note: A very encouraging Regeneron contract.  A $450 million contract for a monoclonal antibody cocktail.  This is a bioengineered version of convalescent plasma, one of the several therapeutics available to treat COVID.  It can be used for prophylaxis and treatment.  And they say they could have up to 70 to 300 thousand doses — vials of this by the end of the summer or early fall.
So Operation Warp Speed continues.  We continue to see encouraging news on the therapeutics front.  And with that, I will take your questions.

656,Trump,2020-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force | Baton Rouge, LA",Nan,"Louisiana State University
Baton Rouge, Louisiana

3:00 P.M. CDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’ve had a very productive day.  I want to thank Governor John Bel Edwards for the briefings that we received today.  I also want to thank — I want to thank the entire team here at LSU for the hospitality.  We — it’s exciting to be in Tiger Stadium, but it’s inspiring to be on a campus and in a state that are making plans not just to open up the economy again, but to open up our schools again.  And we’re, we’re truly grateful — truly grateful for the time and the opportunity.
President Trump asked me to be here to send a very clear message to the people of Louisiana: That we’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you until we put this coronavirus completely in the past and we open up this economy, open up our schools, and we move this state and this nation forward bigger and better than ever before.
I’m particularly, as I said, grateful for Governor John Bel Edwards for the partnership that we’ve enjoyed over the past four months.  Louisiana is really in a unique position.  As we’ve seen rising cases across the Sun Belt, it was here in Louisiana that the people of this state, your state leadership, your healthcare workers have already demonstrated that people of Louisiana know how to slow the spread.  They know how to flatten the curve.  They did it before, and we’re very confident Louisiana is going to do it again, as we see rising cases now across the state.
I also want to express appreciation to Senator Bill Cassidy and Senator John Kennedy for their strong support.  The CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program, the direct support for families would not have been possible without their stalwart support in the United States Senate.
Let me also say how grateful we are to Louisiana’s House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise, for his great leadership, as well as other members of the delegation who have joined us for all of our discussions today: Congressman Garret Graves, Congressman Ralph Abraham, and Congressman Mike Johnson.
The people of Louisiana would be proud.  And President Trump and I are truly grateful for the spirit of partnership with your elected representatives in Washington, D.C., but also with your governor and with this administration.  It has — it has truly been inspiring, and we’re going to continue that partnership every day until — until we put this coronavirus in the past.
Let me be clear: The rising cases across the Sun Belt are serious, and we are going to continue to ensure that Louisiana and all of the affected states have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and the medicines to save lives, to slow the spread.
But while the rise in cases is serious, the people of this state and this nation deserve to know that our ability to respond to this pandemic is substantially better than two and three months ago, when the coronavirus first came to Louisiana.
Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, thanks to the strong partnership we forged with your governor, the support of these members of the Senate and the House, and the extraordinary healthcare workers here in Louisiana and all across this country, we are in a much stronger position to save lives, to protect the most vulnerable, to flatten the curve, and to continue to open up Louisiana and open up America.
Today, we had particular focus on education.  And as I said, being here at the LSU campus, we’re — we’re grateful for the innovative efforts that LSU and that Louisiana, broadly, are taking to open up our schools.
As President Trump has made it clear, as we — to open up America, we got to open up America’s schools.  We believe it’s absolutely in the best interest of students academically and in terms of every aspect of their personal wellbeing to get kids back in the classroom in K-12, and to get students back on campuses, like LSU.
And as we told the faculty here at this great campus, and we assured the governor today, we’re going to continue to make the testing and the PPE and the supplies available to support the reopening of schools all across this state and all across this country.
We’re also going to continue to scale supplies to meet this moment in Louisiana and beyond.  And in just the last several days, the Administrator of FEMA, Pete Gaynor, was here in Louisiana.  He’ll be visiting a local school, I’m told, with Congressman Scalise tomorrow.
This week alone, at the President’s direction, FEMA has deployed military medical personnel to some of the states most impacted.  And we learned today that Louisiana will be making a request for medical personnel, much like those we provided to Louisiana earlier in this pandemic.  And we’ll be moving quickly to respond to that.
We’ve been distributing medicines like remdesivir.  We’ve deployed 19 HHS teams to metropolitan areas around the country impacted by this pandemic.  There’ll be eight more teams deployed in the next several days.  And we’ve been expanding testing and the supplies that support testing.
At the present moment, with the great work of Admiral Brett Giroir, as a member of our task force, we’ve performed more than 40 million tests nationwide, more than — there was a day in just the last week when we actually performed over 800,000 desks [sic] — tests in a single day.  And we’re — we’re incredibly inspired by Louisiana’s innovation from very early on in expanding testing — well above the national average, and we’ll continue to support efforts in that regard.
Also, we were pleased to announce that we were unveiling three different surge testing sites in states around the country.  One includes four locations in Baton Rouge, including LSU’s Alex Box Stadium.  It’ll be for those with symptoms or those who believe they’ve been exposed.  And we’ll be doing a quick turnaround on testing.  This is part of our community testing and surveillance efforts.  And we’ve already deployed those personnel and resources here in Louisiana.
There’s one announcement we informed governors yesterday of that I want to ask Seema Verma, the administrator of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and Admiral Giroir to step to the podium to describe.  We’ve often said the first mission of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, at the President’s direction, was to save lives.  Our mission today is to save lives, to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable, to open up America and open up America’s schools.
But one of the ways that we protect the most vulnerable is by ensuring, as you’ve done so here in Louisiana, to make sure that those who live in long-term care and nursing home facilities have the testing and the PPE support.  And we have a very significant announcement about the deployment of testing resources to our nursing homes, and I’d like to invite my colleagues on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to step forward and describe it.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  You know, from day one, as the Vice President said, we’ve had a focus on protecting the most vulnerable citizens, and that includes our nursing home residents.  And it’s been a very difficult time for them — restriction of visitors, restriction of activities.  But today’s announcement about providing point-of-care tests in every nursing home across the country is very significant.
This is going to allow our nursing homes to test their workers on a weekly basis and also test their patients as well.  And this is important because when they identify a patient that could be potentially — that is infected with the coronavirus or even a staff member, it allows them to do the important work around isolating that patient.  And this is also a significant step forward in reuniting patients with their families, because once we know that the facility is free of the coronavirus, it allows visitors to also come back in.  So this is a very important step.
And thanks to Dr. Giroir for his efforts to make this happen.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, Administrator Verma.  As a native of Louisiana, it’s always great to be back here, and I really feel just wonderful being here in Tiger Stadium.  I did want to say, by any measure, Louisiana, in terms of testing, is in the top 10 states nationally.  And by a couple of measures, they’re either number one or number two — not quite good enough for Coach O, but you’re going to be there very soon.  (Laughter.)
The announcement today is really significant, and let me amplify on Administrator Verma.  It’s very important to protect our vulnerable.  And we know that our elderly in nursing homes are among the most vulnerable, and that’s why we’ve leaned in so heavily with them.  In order to protect them, we recommend that the staff be tested once a week to make sure that they don’t bring, unintentionally, maybe even without symptoms, the virus into the nursing home.  That means 4 to 5 million tests per month.  And, as you know, the turnaround times — because there’s so much testing — is getting a bit longer, and it’s also very expensive.
What we’re talking about today is providing a point of care — that means a rapid, on-the-spot, 20-tests-per-hour instrument, along with tests, to every single of the 15,400 nursing homes within this country.  We’re starting next week with 2,000 of them, ranked by Administrator Verma and her team, that are at risk because of spread in the community.  Seventeen of those are right here in Baton Rouge.  We’re going to start that next week.  This is a very, very significant moment to protect our seniors.  Over the following ensuing weeks, we’re going to distribute to all the rest of the 13,400.
Just to make one comment: This is not an acquisition.  It’s not just writing a check and doing it.  This has been the culmination of about two months of work to develop the technology; to increase the sensitivity of the tests to make sure they’ll be highly protective of investments in manufacturing, in regulatory flexibility with the FDA; to bring it all together; and then, as part of a comprehensive plan, to protect our seniors.
So, I tell you, in the last two and a half years, I’ve been very honored to be a part of a lot of efforts of this administration.  I can tell you this one is going to save thousands of lives.  So this is a really historic moment.  It’s a great moment for our seniors and for those 17 nursing homes in Baton Rouge who will be getting it next week.  All hands on deck.  We’re here to support you.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
So before I turn it over to the governor, let me just — let me just say on behalf of the President and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, that: Governor Edwards, we support your efforts here in Louisiana to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable, to keep opening up your economy and opening up your schools.
But it’s important to remember we all have a role to play, so we want to encourage all the people of Louisiana and all those looking on to continue to adhere to the guidance of your state and local health officials.  Put into practice those commonsense steps that flattened the curve here in Louisiana before and will slow the spread and flatten the curve again: wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask.  Wear a mask whenever state and local authorities say it’s indicated or whenever social distancing is not possible.
Each and every one of us has a role to play.  And we’ll be able to continue to open up.  Now, Governor, I know you have made a decision to pause reopening, to stay at phase two, and we support your decision in that regard.  We’ll continue to flow testing and PPE and resources to support the implementation of your policy.
But I want to assure everyone in Louisiana and all those looking on that we’re opening up America again, and we’re dealing with rising cases across the Sun Belt.  It’s not either/ or.  We don’t have to choose between continuing to open up our economy, making plans to open up our schools, and doing what each and every one of us needs to do to slow the spread and flatten the curve.  Here in Louisiana, you did it before, and we’re very confident that you will do it again.  Because here in Louisiana, you know what the American people know: is that we’re all in this together.
I read a — I read a verse in my devotions this morning that we’re called to run the race marked out for us with endurance and with faith.  And I’m confident that with the endurance, the perseverance, and the faith of the people of this great state and this nation, that we’ll every day be one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past.
And we pledge to continue to work with your governor, with your leaders in Washington, D.C., and with all the great healthcare workers of this state to hasten that day.
Governor?
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I want to thank you for visiting Baton Rouge and Louisiana and bringing Ambassador Birx and Administrator Verma with you, as well as Secretary DeVos and Admiral Giroir.  And I want to thank our congressional delegation.
You know, talking about how we’re number one or number two, and so forth, in testing, I will tell you: It wouldn’t be possible without the support we’ve received from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
And I will tell you that, this week, we will exceed a million tests that we’ve conducted since the beginning.  We’re at 248,000 tests, to date, for the month of July, and that’s less than halfway through the month.  And that’s critically important.  But what the tests are telling us is we have more cases, we have rising positivity, and certainly we know from our hospitals that we have increasing hospitalizations as well.
And my commitment to the Vice President is the same as it is to the people of Louisiana: We’re going to do what’s required to get back in front of this virus and flatten the curve again, and make sure that we are protecting the most vulnerable, that we are saving lives.  And the way that we can reopen our economy, reopen our schools are to do those things that are essential to make sure that we can be successful.  And it’s — it’s really pretty simple at this point.
We don’t want to go backwards to phase one or to phase zero.  So we can — we can continue in phase two, but we are going to have to make sure that we wear the mask, that we social distance, that we limit our social gatherings in terms of the number of people.  And if we will do that, we’re going to be successful, and we don’t have to go — to go back.  And we are going to open our schools and so forth.
And everything we’re going to do, we’re going to do in consultation with the CDC guidelines, the guidance that’s put out by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and certainly working with our own professionals here at the Office of Public Health.  And we’re going to work with all of our local officials and the health community here, because they have been the true heroes.
And we’re going to be successful.  We are going to get back on top of this.  We’re going to flatten the curve.  And we look forward to the day, as the Vice President mentioned — he and President Trump are working — that we put this virus behind us.  And we’re going to work extremely hard.
And, please, Mr. Vice President, know we appreciate your visit.  I appreciate the attention you’ve paid to this state, to the time that you’ve given personally to speak with me anytime that I called, and for all of the assistance that we have received.  Our state is much better off today because of that assistance and because of your work and the work of your task force and our congressional delegation.
And while I know we have a lot of work to do ahead of us, I am optimistic that we’re going to get it done, and we’re going to come through this in fine fashion.  And I’m also praying for that result as well.  I believe in prayer, and I believe in work, and we’re going to do both here in Louisiana because that’s what we’ve done as long as we’ve been a state.
So I want to thank you again for being here.  And I believe, at this point, we’re going to hear from our senior —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)  Dr. Birx.
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  I’m sorry.  Dr. Birx.  I was going to say senior citizen, but she’s not a senior citizen.  (Laughter.)
DR. BIRX:  No, you had that right.
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you very much, Ambassador.
DR. BIRX:  You had that right, Governor.  Thank you, governor.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you to our senators, our congressional members here today.  And thank you to Courtney Phillips and her public health team.
The epidemic you’re facing today in Louisiana is different than the epidemic that you had in March and April that was very much centered in New Orleans and a little bit in Baton Rouge.
This particular epidemic, although the cases are still low, is spread across the state of Louisiana.  And that’s why the Governor is correct: It will take everyone in Louisiana, every single person in Louisiana, to wear a mask.  It will take all of those residents to social distance, to practice personal hygiene.
And as Coach O has explained to me, he was able to keep his football players safe and healthy and well here, and tested, until some might have wandered off to a bar.  And after wandering off to a bar, they did become positive.  And so he’s made it clear that that is not on, any longer, the itinerary for practice.
And so we are really calling on all Louisianans to not be going to bars, not to be even going to bars in people’s houses.  Social gathering of more than 10 people right now is particularly difficult with the type of spread that you have.  But it is this public health group and this governor who was able to stop a very serious epidemic in New Orleans.
And it’s why these cases are still low that we have the opportunity to change the future for Louisiana and be able to decrease the number of cases every day if each of us wear our masks, stay out of bars, make sure you don’t have large gatherings in your households, and really protect one another, and do what we always have said: protecting the most vulnerable in all age groups that may have comorbidities because of their higher risk of severe disease.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
SENATOR CASSIDY:  I will speak as a physician who happens to be a doctor.  And I compliment — one, I thank you all for being here.  I compliment you for recognizing that this is a public health crisis, which has led to an educational crisis, which has led to an economic crisis, which has led to an employment crisis, a family crisis, if you will.  And we only get out of the economic, the educational, the employment, the family crisis if we do something about the public health crisis.
Now, there’s a lot to be said about that, but I’ll just give the local inflection today that I was particularly proud of: LSU and Southern spoke about their partnership, about how they would wish to safely reopen their schools so their children — the students can come back and graduate, but not just that: recognizing that some of the risk factors for having a worse episode of coronavirus infection — the obesity, diabetes, hypertension, minority race — are represented in our state.
We have the ability to not only keep our state healthier, but to learn lessons that will benefit the rest of the nation and the rest of the world.  And that will be our unique contribution to unraveling the public health crisis, which therefore makes the education, the employment, the employer, and all other aspects of this that much better.
So again, Mr. Vice President and your team: Thank you for coming.  And we, in Louisiana, just look forward to working with you for those solutions.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator.
SENATOR KENNEDY:  As I have said repeatedly today, Vice President Pence has been a powerful partner to President Trump, and he honors us with his presence today, as do — as does each member of his entire team.  I’ve gotten to know Mike Pence well.  He has been a rock, and he has been a rockstar for the American people.
Second and final point: Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Austria, South Korea, Japan, even Vietnam, for God’s sakes, have opened their schools, and they’ve done so safely.  And so can America and so should America.
We have lost 30 precious lives to the coronavirus of kids under the age of 15, and that is 30 too many.  But the point is: Our kids don’t seem to be as susceptible to the virus as adults.  If we used our head, we can open our schools safely.  I can promise you that not opening our schools will do our children so much more harm than the coronavirus ever can.
In Louisiana, for many of our children, our schools are the most stable things in their lives, and that’s what we need to work hard on every single day.
Finally, our universities can help us.  All of our universities in Louisiana are going to be open this fall.  Our public labs have done a wonderful job.  Our private labs have done a wonderful job.  Many of our university labs have done a wonderful job.  But I’m going to challenge our universities today, right here in Louisiana and elsewhere: Step up to the plate.  Help us do more testing.  That’ll get — help us get elementary and secondary education back on its feet.
Once again, thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to your entire team.  And to the governor, I want to thank all of them for giving so much to Louisiana and to America.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Please, Congressman.
REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE:  Well, I want to really welcome Vice President Mike Pence to Tiger Stadium.  As an Indiana Hoosier, we appreciate that he’s come here today.  But Vice President Pence has been here every time we’ve needed him.  The Trump administration, top down, every time there’s been — whether it’s a shortage of PPE, additional relief packages — the Trump administration and this task force led by Vice President Pence have been nonstop working to make sure that we have the things that we need to continue to confront this pandemic.
It’s still out there, but we also know that we’ve got to start safely reopening, as Governor Edwards has led the way to show that we can open our schools; that we have to open our schools.  It’s not a question of whether or not the schools will reopen; it’s how best to safely reopen.
And today’s roundtable was really informative, as we saw the heads of the LSU system, the Southern System, student body president representing the University of Louisiana system talking about the importance of safely reopening schools.  It’s got to be our challenge to ensure that we’re there for our kids to make sure that they can go back to school and they can go back in a safe way.  It’s not the same thing to be taught at home.
Not only do they need that instruction, but we’ve seen psychiatrists giving studies, we’ve seen pediatrics studies that have shown the damage it causes to our kids not being in school.  So it’s our challenge to make sure that we put the protocols out there to safely reopen.  And I appreciate Vice President Pence’s leadership in doing that.
And I also want to thank the Vice President and his whole team.  Of course, Admiral Giroir, good to see you back here in Louisiana, but you’re doing a great service to our nation.  And CMS Administrator Seema Verma — what they just announced today, don’t underestimate how important that is.  When you look at the crisis and the deaths: Over 40 percent of America’s deaths from coronavirus have happened to seniors in nursing homes.  They represent less than 1 percent of America’s population, yet account for over 40 percent of the deaths.  And as we’ve dug into the data to find out who to protect and how best to protect people all across the country, we know the most vulnerable.  And the fact that they’re going to be putting these testing facilities into every nursing home in America is a revolutionary breakthrough.
What you’ve done with Operation Warp Speed to find cures, to find vaccines, the testing that’s being done today, and the red tape that’s being removed by agencies like the FDA, I can’t thank President Trump and Vice President Pence enough for their efforts to lead us through this so that we ultimately find a vaccine, find a cure.  But in the meantime — and, by the way, over 70,000 vials of remdesivir that have been allocated to Louisiana from the National Stockpile; thank you for that, Mr. Vice President — but we’re going to continue working at warp speed to address this.
But it’s critical that we reopen our schools, and I appreciate the conversation we had here today to get that done, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Steve.  And before we go to questions, I’d like the Secretary of Education, Secretary Betsy DeVos, to step forward.  She has literally been traveling the country, working with states and school systems around America to get our kids back in the classroom.
Madam Secretary.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you so much for convening us here today, for your and President Trump’s leadership during this time.  I will just reflect again what so many have said up here in the last few moments: that our kids have got to get back to school.  And it’s not a matter of if; it’s just a matter of how.
There are so many ways that we can think outside of the box how to address specific needs.  But as — as has been noted, the question of a child’s health is a multi-dimensional one.  And we know that too many kids today have been harmed by being at home these last several months.  Their mental wellbeing, their social-emotional growth, and particularly those that are most vulnerable among us have been harmed by not being able to continue their learning and continue to be in classrooms with their teachers and their peers.
So I know that Americans are a people of great determination and action and can-do spirit.  And this is a great opportunity for adults to step up and show and demonstrate and model grit and determination to ensure that kids can continue their learning come fall.  And I and my team and, I know, this whole administration stands ready to help and support in every way we possibly can.  And we look forward to all of the creative solutions that we’re going to see across this country.
So, thank you again, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of this task force and your and the President’s continued commitment to the future of this nation.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Madam Secretary.  With that, questions.  We’ve got time for a few questions before we have to go.
Go ahead.  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-baton-rouge-la/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  President Trump will participate in a roundtable to hear stories of families positively impacted by law enforcement.  That will be taking place shortly after this briefing concludes.  The President stands with our police officers, our men and women across this country who valiantly patrol our streets and protect our protect our citizenry.
This President stands on the side of law and order to secure peace in our streets.  That has always been his priority, and remains so today.
Tragically, this weekend, we saw a devastating ambush attack against brave law enforcement officers in McAllen, Texas: Officer Edelmiro Garza, Jr., who was 45 years old, and Officer Ismael Chavez, who was 39 years old.  And while responding to a domestic disturbance call, Officers Garza and Chavez arrived on scene to protect the people that they serve.  They were met with gunfire.  They were ambushed by a violent and dangerous suspect who horrifically shot before they even drew their weapon or had a chance to call for backup.
We honor the lives and the service of Officer Garza and Officer Chavez.  This President will always stand on the side of law enforcement and the heroes who protect and serve.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

2:05 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  There has been no greater champion for rectifying racial and income disparities in America’s educational system than President Trump.
Every child regardless of race, income level, or zip code deserves an equal playing field of opportunity to access the American Dream.  Making that goal a reality begins in our schools.  The evidence is clear: An analysis of 41 major urban areas found that black and Hispanic students made the largest gains in educational access because of school choice, according to a CREDO study.
That is why President Trump has been clear in saying in his State of the Union: “For too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools.  To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships.  The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.”  Now I go — “I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity…Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act,” he said, “because no parents should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.”
Well, now, if Democrats have their way, children will not have access to schools at all.  And that is not acceptable to President Trump.  President Trump continues to fight for equal opportunity in our schools by boldly and firmly underscoring the absolute necessity of America’s schools to reopen this fall.  The data is clear: Sustained school closures hurt students who have fewer resources the most.
McKinsey and Co. created these models — I have some graphs for you — to estimate the potential impact of school closures, and they found this, quote: “How much learning students lose during school closures vary significantly by access to remote learning, the quality of remote instruction, home support, and the degree of engagement.”
As you can see in this chart, students who experience average-quality remote learning progress, but at a slower pace; students who are getting lower-quality remote learning stagnate at current grade levels; and students who are not getting instruction at home lose significant ground with some students dropping out altogether.
As you can see in the three scenarios mapped on this graph, if students return to school in the fall, the disparities are far less than if they return in January of next year or the fall of next year, where disparities and learning are enormous.
But school closures affect more than just learning.  As the NAACP has pointed out, “For students of color at all levels across the country, school closings create problems even more urgent than the interruption of their educations.  Schools also serve as a community nexus for food and for housing.”
Rest assured that President Trump knows more than anyone the importance of opening our schools, which is why he has been the most vocal advocate for reopening.  And President Trump’s America — make no mistake that he will continue to be the biggest fighter for equal opportunity in our schools and continued access to the American Dream for all.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-9-2020/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Today, President Trump welcomed to the White House President López Obrador of Mexico.  The meeting reaffirmed the incredibly strong ties between President Obrador and President Trump.  The leaders noted that many people have bet against their ability to work together in a strong and productive fashion.  But rest assured, they work together, and they work together well.  The U.S.-Mexico relationship has never been stronger or more productive, thanks to the leadership of President Trump.
The USMCA, in particular, is a major win for our two countries and for America’s workers.  Under the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement, more than 4 million man — manu- — excuse me, more than 4 million manufacturing jobs will be regained that were lost under NAFTA.  This will be a huge influx of American jobs that were lost under the failed NAFTA trade deal that went into effect.
In addition, tens of thousands of manufacturing plants were lost because of NAFTA; we want to bring those on shore.  And the USMCA will go a long way in bringing back those manufacturing plants and those millions of jobs that were lost under NAFTA.
NAFTA was a bad deal for the American worker because it left American workers behind.  Many politicians forgot the damage wrought by disastrous trade deals such as NAFTA, but President Trump did not forget.  It took this President to change the status quo, renegotiate NAFTA, and secure a better deal for the American worker.
And here’s why: The USMCA alone will create 176,000 American jobs.  We believe the other trade deals that this President has negotiated will add to that number and help undo a lot of what NAFTA has done.  The USMCA will boost American manufacturing, including wages, new jobs, and exports.  And the USMCA will create 76,000 auto manufacturing jobs, crucial to the wellbeing of this country.
The USMCA is good for business, as President Trump rebuilds the strongest, most inclusive economy in history.  The USMCA will help jumpstart our economy.  The USMCA is projected to increase GDP by $235 billion.  This means jobs, jobs, jobs.
And during today’s meeting between the presidents, one official from Mexico noted that many considered the USMCA an 80/20 probability.  Now, it is 100 percent certainty.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-8-2020/

11:41 A.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good morning all.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, here at the Department of Education, as part of our ongoing effort to focus on a mission to save lives, meet the needs of our states and our healthcare workers, to protect the vulnerable, and to safely reopen America and reopen America’s schools.
As you will hear today from Admiral Brett Giroir, at this point, we have tested more than 39 million Americans.  Among those, more than 3 million Americans have tested positive and more than 1.3 million Americans have recovered.  Sadly, more than 133,000 Americans have lost their lives, and our sympathies are with all of the impacted families.
And while we mourn with those who mourn, because of what the American people have done, because of the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers around the country, we are encouraged that the average fatality rate continues to be low and steady.  And at days earlier this week, it was actually 90 percent lower than at the height of this pandemic.
Again, it’s a credit to the sacrifices the American people have made, to the extraordinary work that our healthcare workers are doing.  And we pledge that this task force, working in partnership with governors all across the country, is going to continue to work our hearts out 24 hours a day to continue to keep our losses low.
In just a few moments, Dr. Deborah Birx will outline the data that we’re seeing around the country.  We’re tracking literally state by state, county by county.  But as she will describe in a moment, we’re actually seeing early indications of a percent of positive testing flattening in Arizona and Florida and Texas.  Governors in each of those states have taken strong steps to flatten the curve.  And again, as Dr. Birx will describe, we’re beginning to see early indications that positivity is flattening, and in Arizona and Florida, we’re beginning to see declining numbers of emergency room visits as well.
We believe the takeaway from this for every American, particularly in those states that are impacted, is: Keep doing what you’re doing, because we’re starting to see the first indications that as we were able to do in the Northeast, as we were able to do in New Orleans and Louisiana and Michigan and other places around the country, we’re putting into practice those mitigation efforts and we’re beginning to see indications that they are having a good effect.
We are focused on the states where more than half of the new cases have arisen — Texas, Arizona, Florida, and California — and have received encouraging reports even through this morning: strong supplies of PPE in hospitals; hospital capacity remains strong.
The one need that we did hear from governors across the region is for personnel.  And over the last week, working through FEMA, the Department of Defense, and HHS, we’ve been processing requests to deploy over 1,070 doctors and nurses and medical personnel.  At this point, roughly 525 doctors and nurses are on the ground in Arizona, California, and Texas, and we’re processing a request from Florida for an additional amount.
We’ve made it very clear as we — if you’ll recall, we deployed, at the President’s direction, active-duty military medical personnel to New York, to New Jersey, to Connecticut, to Michigan, to Louisiana, and we’re in the process of doing that again just to make sure that those dedicated doctors and nurses and healthcare workers have the relief that they need as we see cases rising in various communities across the Sun Belt.  And we’ll continue to work that.
We had a conference call yesterday with the nation’s governors.  We are in the process of continuing to send, every week, detailed county-by-county summaries, analysis, and recommendations to governors that are being — that are being implemented and well received.
We also are issuing renewed guidance on preservation and reuse of PPE.  Again, what we’re hearing, in not just speaking to governors but talking directly to hospitals, is that, frankly, because of the historic effort that President Trump implemented to spin up hundreds of millions of supplies of gloves and masks and face shields and — as well as the construction of ventilators — we now have 59,000 ventilators in our supplies — PPE, we hear, remains very strong, but we’re encouraging healthcare workers to begin now to use some of the best practices that we learned in other parts of the country to preserve and to reuse the PPE supplies.
So our focus is to make sure our states have everything they need, when they need it.  And we’re working closely with all the governors to make that a reality.  But what brings us to the Department of Education is, as we — as we see to the needs of our states and we focus on the healthcare of the American people, we’re working to reopen America and to reopen America’s schools.
And yesterday, President Trump convened a summit of education leaders and health officials at the White House.  And as the President made clear yesterday: It’s time.  It’s time for us to get our kids back to school.  And the summit yesterday gave us an opportunity to outline and to learn what we might be able to do then.
In just a few moments, I’m going to ask Secretary DeVos to talk about the approach the Department of Education is taking to assisting local communities and states in bringing their schools back online.  And also, we’ll hear from Dr. Bob Redfield, who has been literally, since early in this pandemic, providing guidance to schools and will be issuing additional guidance next week.
I wouldn’t want to pass the opportunity, though, not just as Vice President but as someone who’s been married to a school teacher now for 35 years, just to say — to say thank you to all the teachers out there.  From early in this pandemic, teachers learned how to do the distance teaching and did a remarkable job, oftentimes having to care for their own families and make sure their own children’s studies were happening.  So to all of our — America’s teachers, we say thank you.
We also want to say thank you to the parents — the parents who had to step in and become educators for all of their kids.  It’s really been remarkable when you see what our kids have been able to accomplish during this difficult time.
But what we heard again yesterday from education officials and what we heard from the American Academy of Pediatrics: It’s absolutely essential that we get our kids back into a classroom for in-person learning.  We can’t let our kids fall behind academically, but it’s important that the American people remember that for children that have mental health issues, for special needs children, for nutrition for children in communities facing persistent poverty, the school is the place where they receive all those services.
And so this is not just simply about making sure our kids are learning and they’re advancing academically, but for their mental health, for their wellbeing, for their physical health, for nutrition.  We got to get our kids back to school.
And as you heard the President yesterday and even again this morning, we’re absolutely determined to work in partnership with our states to give the guidance for states and communities to be able to safely reopen our schools.  The CDC will be issuing new guidance next week — part of a five-part series of recommendations that will give all-new tools to our schools.
But what Dr. Redfield made clear yesterday I’m sure he’ll make clear again today, is: We’re here to help.  We don’t want federal guidance to be a substitute for state and local laws and rules and guidance.  We’re here to assist with the shared objective that I think is shared by every parent in America, which is we want to get our kids back.  We want to get them back in the classroom.  We want to get our teachers back in the front of those classrooms.  We got to get our kids learning, in person, once again.
As Congress is still in recess but will gather again soon, we already are in discussions about additional potential support, although we were able to remind governors that $13.3 billion is available in the CARES Act for states, to be able to assist them as they roll out and restart schools across the country.
At the present moment, we learned yesterday that only 1.5 percent of those funds has been drawn down by states, and we encouraged the governors to take advantage of that.
Our objectives, as I said, are to save lives, meet the needs of our states and their healthcare workers, protect the most vulnerable, and safely reopen America, and safely reopen our schools.
And the good news is we are — we are reopening America.  The jobs report last Thursday spoke for itself: Nearly 5 million jobs created.  And I can tell you, evidence all around the country is that the American people are finding a way to do their part to put the health of their neighbors first, even while we all find a way to get back to work, to worship, and to school.
And we all have a role to play to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable, and to safely reopen our country and our schools.  And so I would just — I would just close, before I turn the podium over to Dr. Birx for her report, just simply to say thank you to the American people.  Thank you for what you’ve done so far.  Thank you for the way you’ve put the health and wellbeing of not just family members and friends, but strangers — people you didn’t even know — first.
And we just encourage you to keep doing what you’re doing:  Keep heeding the guidance of state and local authorities.  Practice good hygiene.  Wash your hands.  Wear a mask wherever state and local authorities determine it’s indicated, or wear a mask where you can’t engage in social distancing.
This is the role each of us can continue to play, and we’re seeing some early indications in some of the most impacted states that Americans are doing just that.  So we want to encourage you on and tell you that we’re going to continue to do our part.
And I’m just absolutely confident — just as we proved when this pandemic was striking so deeply in the Northeast, when it was striking in Louisiana and in Michigan — the American people know what needs to be done, and we know we can do it.
And we flattened — we flattened the curve before, we slowed the spread before, and we can do it again.  But we’ve got to all do our part, and we’ll do it together.
With that, Dr. Deborah Birx.  And then we’ll get a report from Admiral Giroir before we move on to other reports.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  If I could have the first slide, please.  And I know some of you do watch what I wear, so I’m wearing this specially today.  This came from the Salt River tribe.  I just want to — masks can be a fashion statement.
And I want to thank the Salt River tribe.  It was a real pleasure to be out and speaking to individuals around the United States about the issues that they’re facing with COVID-19, to be able to meet with communities, hospital personnel, African American communities, Hispanic communities, and our (inaudible) tribal nations.  That was a privilege last week.
I want to start with Arizona, just to pick up where the Vice President left off.  That orange line is the number of tests performed, and the blue line is the test positivity.  Now, this is at the level of the state.  And Arizona does have three counties that we’re tracking very closely, obviously you know that the largest one being Phoenix and Maricopa County.  But this does show that the blue line, which is a five-day — a seven-day average — and thank you to the data team for these wonderful slides — the five — the seven-day average is showing some flattening, and we find that encouraging.
Also equally encouraging at this point — because we know that the test-positivity rate is the first thing to increase, and we’re hoping that it heralds a stability in Arizona of at least reaching a plateau in their curve.
The red line represents the emergency room visits for any of the COVID-like symptoms.  And this is also an early indicator, and we find that encouraging.
The next slide does show the counties that we’re tracking.  Obviously, the largest county being Maricopa County with the largest number of infections, but clearly there’s issues in Yuma and Pima.
The Vice President mentioned the weekly reports that go to governors.  This is what the report looks like.  It (inaudible) their full-side pages.
This is Alaska’s.  On the front page is our interpretation of what we’re seeing, relevant to their epidemic, with specific recommendations related to where we see them, as far as being in a danger zone.  They are coded by yellow and red.  And it follows that they see everything you’re seeing on that first report in boxes — warning boxes — and then each of the counties are represented so that they have, in one place, five pages from the White House and task force that summarizes what we’re seeing.  And that goes out weekly.
Next slide, please.
This looks at Florida, and you can see, in the same way, the red line — early suggestions of decreasing emergency room visits for the symptoms of COVID and some stability starting in that blue line.  Hoping that heralds stability in the number of daily reported cases.
We also understand that we went through a holiday weekend, and holiday weekends can impact datas on both ends: underreporting through the weekend and then catch-up reporting on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after a holiday weekend.
Next slide.
This shows the counties of Florida that we’re tracking.  These are the top 10 counties in Florida, and you can see each of them have a different profile.
I want to call your attention to the counties that are across the bottom there that are more difficult to see.  Some of those represent Jacksonville and other large metros, including Tampa.  When the governor talks about how they were “steady and low” for a long period of time after reopening, this is where that is reflected for almost five weeks after reopening.  Clearly, there was something that happened though.  And those that we’re looking into across the board — because whatever happened in Florida happened across the Sun Belt, and that all of the curves and all of the findings are mirrored.
If you remember early on in March and April, we were talking about, first, the New York metro, followed by Boston, followed by Philadelphia, then Chicago — and New Orleans was with the New York metro.  And so it was a series of individual curves.
In this case, whatever occurred occurred almost simultaneously across the South.  And so we’re investigating that very closely to really see the etiology behind that because that can help us as an early warning signal, but also help us in guidance to the American people of what we’re asking them to do.
Next slide.
Texas.  And you can see Texas is in a similar situation with their blue line.  And we’re watching this very closely across Texas.
Next slide.
But I think all of you know that there is a series of major metros in Texas with significant increase in cases from Houston to Dallas to San Antonio to El Paso and McAllen area.  And so the governors get this type of report with specific recommendations.
And then, finally, California, where you can see — next slide, thank you — again, a long time of stability, but then this increase in the number of test positives and rapid increase in cases.
Next slide.
And you can see the majority of the issue is in the Los Angeles area, although we see this through Riverside, Imperial, Sacramento, and now San Francisco with increased number of cases.
So I want to finish with where the Vice President started: about the sacrifices of the American people.  Because in that recommendations are very clear recommendations that when you have a county with these types of cases, we are recommending everyone using a face covering.  And I think the studies now that have been done, showing that cotton face coverings work, that does open up the ability for us all to have individualized face coverings that express our personality.
But in addition, I think the work that these governors have done to — and ask the American people is it’s stop going to bars, to close the bars, to move to outdoor dining, to decrease indoor — any kind of indoor gatherings again.  To all of the Americans out there that are in these four states and the states that have — in the report, were in the red zone — because there’s a series of other states that we have in that zone — is really asking the American people in those counties and in those states — in those states to not only use the face coverings — not going to bars, not going to indoor dining — but really not gathering in homes either and decreasing those gatherings back down to our phase one recommendation, which was 10 or less.
So, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Admiral, report on testing.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Since we’re bragging on our face coverings, this was made by a small religious community in Pennsylvania, who were helped by the Public Health Service, and they hand sewed these for a lot of our officers to match our operational dress — those blue uniforms.  So, I wear this proudly, and I think of that community every single day — everybody pitching in across America to help us all.
So, in terms of testing, I want to cover three quick topics.  First one is just where we are numerically.  The Vice President has already said, we are now topping 39 million tests across the country.  The states really crushed their goal in June.  The state goals was about 12.9 million in June; CDC numbers have finalized that at about 16 and a half million tests for June.  So, congratulations to almost all of the states who made their goal and exceeded their goal.
We’re doing very well right now, between 6- and 700,000 tests per day.  We did top the 700,000 mark last week, and we’re averaging about 620-630,000 tests per day.  We continue to ship.  We are ripe with swabs and media.  So the states tell us what they need.  We work with them to set those goals, based on their state testing plans.
After technical assistance by the CDC and my office, FEMA ships those every week.  Now that’s along with ASPR — the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response — at HHS.  So that’s sort of the overall general view.
We announced, yesterday, what we talked about a little bit last week, and that is federal surge sites.  We opened these in three communities.  There was a list of communities identified by Dr. Birx and her team that had certain characteristics of their infection trend, but also met certain characteristics of numerical numbers in isolation that surge testing might have an impact over a short period of time.
So our goal, in those communities, is to do at least 5,000 tests per day.  And those are in Baton Rouge, Jacksonville, and McAllen — the McAllen in Texas.  And we have many other sites that we’re working with.  Again, this is a partnership with the state and local governments to make that happen.  They’re up and running and testing in all three sites.  Baton Rouge started yesterday, the other two sites start today, and we already have almost 6,500 appointments already made this morning.  So that’s going very, very well.
The last thing I wanted to talk about is Phoenix.  And I don’t know if we have the slides for this.  I get just a little bit concerned when I hear things in the news, like “we’re doing nothing for Phoenix” and “the federal government hasn’t been doing anything with Phoenix.”  Because that really is not correct, and it undermines a lot of the things that we’re doing.
I’m going to show you some slides.  I didn’t make these slides up.  My team — this was part of a 55-slide deck — 55-slides slide deck just on Phoenix, where we understand the demographics, the health disparities, the income levels, the racial and ethnicity backgrounds, where the tests are done, where the resources are.  This is how we really work the issues.
So, first of all, we’re in constant contact with Governor Ducey and his team.  His state health officials are outstanding.  We not only talk on the calls, but we have frequent calls.  And I know Dr. Redfield does this as well, and Ambassador Birx does this as well.
Number two, we provide support according to the state plans.  Just in the last two months, we’ve shipped over 500,000 swabs and media to the state to fulfill their plans.
In terms of Phoenix — if I can get the first slide back, please — I just want to say that, yes, we have lots of support in Phoenix.  This is the community-based testing locations.  I didn’t decode this because it’s right out of my slide deck.  Phoenix has three federally funded retail sites.  This is paid on a per-capita basis.  You come up and get a test.  These sites — not these three sites, but this overall program has tested just under a million individuals, and they’re located specifically in communities of high social vulnerability.  We have three there.
We also have 13 — what we call “3.0 sites.”  These are retail pharmacies that, because of our regulatory flexibility, they can do that without a federal stipend or grant.  They do this just through the insurance Medicare and Medicaid billing system.  So, those are 16 federal sites we have in Phoenix.
Next slide.
I don’t know if there’s a map to go with that, but under the leadership of Secretary Azar, we’ve really surged into FQHCs — Federally Qualified Health Centers.  This is where you really want testing to happen because these are medical homes for those who are indigent and underserved.  We have 28 FQHCs sites performing testing just in the Phoenix area right now.
Next slide.
We don’t have that slide, but let me talk about — we’ve also identified every single testing machine in Phoenix.  So there are testing machines to do tens of thousands of tests per day.  And we’re sending at least 100,000 — okay, maybe it’ll come up, maybe it won’t, but at least 100,000 assays to the Phoenix area every week.
So these are all the things we’re doing in the background, that happen on a regular basis, that we do community by community by community.
Now, two days ago, I heard that Mayor Gallego was unhappy because there was no federal support.  I heard that on Monday — on Monday morning.  I was on the phone with the FEMA representative in the afternoon.  It was clear to me that Phoenix was not in tune with all the things that the state were doing.  We convened a call last night, where we had Governor Ducey’s people on the phone, where we had the mayor’s people on the phone, where we had various health officials on the phone.  We got everybody together, understood where the gaps are.  There’s a surge from Arizona State.  There are a surge in testing sites that are state testing sites in Phoenix that are up there.
And this morning, Governor Ducey looked at everything, thought a surge site would be helpful in west Phoenix.  He requested that, and we’re contracting that right now.
So I just wanted to give you that example because it really pains me when somebody says the federal government isn’t doing anything, when we have 41 federal sites there.  We’re sending supplies, we’re sending tests.  And we work with the governor every day.  And if there’s an appropriate request and it’s on the list for Dr. Birx, which it was, we will send a surge site.  And that’s what we’re doing; we’re contracting that this afternoon.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good job, Brett.  Thank you, Admiral Giroir.
As we said, the focus today is on safely reopening our schools.  And as we discussed yesterday at the White House summit, from very early in this process, the Centers for Disease Control has been issuing guidance for schools and for childcare services, in early March — March the 12th, to be specific.  And when we first published the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” and encouraged people to engage in schooling from home, wherever possible, from that point forward, CDC has published decision trees about how schools can begin to develop reopening plans, and just last week, published new guidance for K-12 schools.
But next week, as Dr. Redfield can elaborate in a few moments, they’ll be issuing five new documents that’ll range from preparing communities to return to school safely, to decision-making tools for parents and caregivers, and to create symptom screening considerations as children and teachers return to school.
But as we made clear yesterday, we’ll make clear again today: We’re here to help.  And none of the CDC’s recommendations are intended to replace state and local rules and guidance; that what we’ve made clear to governors and to state and local health officials is CDC stands ready to work with local officials as they tailor their plan for reopening their schools.  But we’re all committed to getting our kids back in the classroom and getting them back in the classroom this fall.
With that, I want the Secretary of Education to reflect on the efforts she’s making here at the Department of Education, then we’ll hear from Dr. Redfield, and then a few wrap-up comments from Secretary of HHS before we go to questions.
Madam Secretary?
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thanks, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President.  Thanks for hosting the task force here today.  We are so grateful to the President and to you for your leadership on doing what’s right for students.
Yesterday we had a really good and important conversation at the White House with local leaders and great teachers and parents.  It was insightful and inspiring.  And as Mrs. Pence noted, these past few months, parents have worn multiple hats.  They really are our unsung heroes, and I might add, as the Vice President noted, as are the teachers who were often playing dual roles as parents themselves and continuing to help their students learn.
She also said — Mrs. Pence also said that as we reopen businesses, restaurants, theaters in our country, we simply can’t leave out our schools, and that is so correct.  Students can and must continue to learn full-time.
I’ve been really inspired by the innovative teachers, schools, and their communities that have kept learning going through this past few months, and they’re getting ready to do it again this fall.
A couple of great examples in Harlem and the surrounding boroughs in New York: Success Academy moved to distance learning in one week, using multiple technology platforms.  Teachers there insisted on learning new materials, right along with their students.  The students were still graded.  They made sure all the students had the needed tech that they did not maybe have at home, initially.
Miami-Dade County used its existing instructional continuity plans to make a seamless transition to distance learning.  They added interventions for students who were struggling already before the pandemic.
The International Leadership Academy in Texas started from the mindset that not learning wasn’t an option for any student.  They delivered multilingual and special education curriculum to all of their students.  There were a number of schools and districts across the country that did an awesome job of transitioning this spring.  And there were a lot in which I and state school leaders were disappointed in that they didn’t figure out how to continue to serve their students.  Too many of them just gave up.
The Center for Reinventing Public Education said that only 10 percent across the board provided any kind of real curriculum and instruction program.
And, as I said, I’ve talked to all of the state school chiefs at least once, most of them more than once, and they’ve told me that while many of their districts in their states have done well through the past several months, a number of them, they were very disappointed in, in doing next to nothing.
And then we see as we talk about reopening schools, there are some creating false paradigms for the fall.  And here, right in our neighborhood, the D.C. area, Fairfax County, which is one of the most well-funded — I would call it an elite public school system in America — offered families a so-called “choice” for this fall: either zero days in school for their students or two days.  And their springtime attempt at distance learning was a disaster.  I have to — I give this as an example because things like this cannot happen again in the fall.  It would fail America’s students, and it would fail taxpayers who pay high taxes for their education.
Ultimately, it’s not a matter of “if” schools should reopen, it’s simply a matter of “how.”  They must fully open, and they must be fully operational.  And how that happens is best left to education and community leaders.
I really appreciate something that Secretary Azar reiterated yesterday at the White House.  It’s the Surgeon General’s prescription for healthcare, and I’m going to repeat it again because it bears repeating:
First, ask yourself what’s your individual circumstance.  Are you or is someone in your home vulnerable?  Second, what’s going on in your community?  Is the virus widespread or is it isolated?  And third, think about the kind of school activity that you’re talking — that you’re thinking about how to — how to accommodate and deal with.
What needs to be in place for things to be successful: Education leaders need to examine real data for their own states and communities and weigh the risks.  Local leaders in every community need to ask these questions and consider all the risks.  Physical health and safety are factors — so is mental health; so is social emotional development; and importantly, very importantly, so are lost opportunities for students, particularly the most vulnerable among us and students with disabilities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics noted: Keeping schools closed “places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.”  The Pediatrics guidance concluded that everyone “should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.”  “Fully open” and “fully operational” means that students need a full school year or more, and it’s expected it will look different depending on where you are.
What’s clear is that students and their families need more options.  I’ve talked a long time about the need to rethink education and the — to expand education options for all students.  This moment really demands action, and America always was, and is, and always will be a country of doers.
We are confident that with grit and determination and a measure of grace, we can and will do what’s right for all the students in our nation.  Thanks very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  First and foremost, I want to make it very, very clear that the guidance that CDC continues to put out for schools K-12 and higher learning is intentional for reopening and keeping our schools open.  That’s its purpose.  We recognize that there’s a variety of unique circumstances for different schools and different school districts, and so we’ve outlined a number of strategies that those schools, those administrators can use to accomplish this goal safely.
But I want to make it very clear that what is not the intent of CDC’s guidelines is to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed.  We’re prepared to work with each school, each jurisdiction to help them use the different strategies that we propose that help do this safely so they come up with the optimal strategy for those schools.
I think it’s critical — and it would be, personally, very disappointing to me and, I know, my agency — if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools.
I think there’s a series of different additional guidelines that we are about to put out to help, really, with the K-12 community, particularly at the community level, to help open safely.  Guidelines also that come out were consideration documents for parents and caregivers; guidelines for schools to help them understand how best to do symptom surveillance and characterize symptoms in the schools as a tool; and guidelines to really work out how — and the ins and outs of using face mask in the school setting; as well as, finally, some guidance and to help the schools have systems which they can monitor their programs.
But I want to close by just reiterating again: The purpose of CDC’s guidance is — remember, it’s guidance; it’s not requirements — and its purpose is to facilitate the reopening and the keeping open the schools in this country.  Because as the Vice President said, it is critical that we get these schools open and do it safely.  We’re prepared to work with all the school districts and schools to help them facilitate their development of their own unique plan to accomplish that.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Dr. Redfield.  Opening up schools is the right thing to do for our kids so they don’t fall behind academically and also so that children that are in need of services — special-needs children, children with mental health issues, nutrition needs — have the support that they receive at the schools.
It’s important, though, for parents and for working families.  And we — I asked Secretary Scalia to be here from the Department of Labor to speak about the impact on — as we put America back to work, making it possible for us to have single parents back in the workforce, it’s essential that we get our schools open as well.
And so I wanted Secretary Scalia, and then of course Secretary of HHS, to finish our remarks before we go to questions.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY SCALIA:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  It’s good to be with you all today.  For reasons that Secretary DeVos has mentioned and that the Vice President mentioned, of course, having our schools open is so important to our children’s education.  But as the Vice President has said, it’s very important as well to working men and women across the country who need to be able to structure their workdays in a predictable manner.   And the expectation that schools will be open and their children will be able to be in school so that the parents, in turn, can have a predictable schedule that they bring to the workplace, of course, that’s important to our business places as well.  And in that sense, it’s really critically important to our national reopening.
One study has suggested that if we closed all our schools and daycare for just a month — just, hypothetically, if we did that — the impact on U.S. productivity would be in the order of $50 billion.  That gives you some sense of the impact having our schools closed can have on our national recovery.
I did want to mention a couple of groups in particular to whom this is very important.  First: lower-wage workers.  One of the great triumphs of the economy that we enjoyed until the virus came was how well lower-income men and women were doing in the workplace.  We, as you know, had unemployment that tied a 50-year low.  We had record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and others.  And we had rising wages; wages actually rose about 15 percent for lower-income men and women during the first three years of this administration.
Unfortunately — and a number of people have observed this — it’s the lower-income workers who’ve been particularly adversely affected by some of the shutdowns that we’ve had in response to the coronavirus.
Unemployment among the lower-income workers has been higher than for other populations.  And therefore, for them, having schools reopen so that they can themselves have predictable schedules, be able to return to the workplace, is going to be very important.  They hold jobs that are less likely be jobs by which you can telecommute.  I think many of us know that, even telecommuting, there are burdens being placed on mothers, fathers who are getting up a little bit earlier or staying up a lot later to get work done, to plan around caring for their children in the interim.  But for lower-income men and women, that option often is not even available.
And then, second, let me comment briefly on working women, who — studies show and I think the experience of many of us reflects that it’s women in the household who quite often bear the larger burden when it comes to caring for children.  Studies show this.  And again, prior to COVID, another great success of the economy we were enjoying was the employment rate for women.  The unemployment rate for women was actually lower than for men, right before the virus came.  But unfortunately — and this is a statistic we’ve been tracking — we see that the unemployment rate for women now is higher than it is for men.
Now, we made great progress in June.  The Vice President mentioned the extraordinary jobs report.  We’ve put seven and a half million Americans back to work in just two months, and the unemployment rate for women dropped nearly 3 percent in June.
But still, we have important work to do, and we know that working women will have a harder time getting back to the workplace.  They continue to cite childcare at a much higher rate than men do as a reason that they’re not able to work.  And so for them, too, reopening our schools will be very important.
Look, just to wrap up — and it’s such an important sense the pace and structure of our national life is built around the expectation that our young people will be in school, in person, during the school year.  That’s so important for them, but it’s also vitally important for their parents, and in that sense, so critical to this reopening that is proceeding very well, economically.  But to keep going, we need our schools open in the fall.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Gene.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the President’s all-of-America approach to combatting the virus and for the focus that you’re now putting on getting our kids safely back to school.
From HHS’s perspective, reopening schools safely may be the single-most important thing that we can do to support healthy families during this pandemic.  All decisions about undertaking activities during COVID-19 have to look at risk as a continuum, not a binary question.  States and school districts can think about the same things that we urge individuals to think about.
As Secretary DeVos noted, our Surgeon General has come out with his “prescription for health.”  Ask yourself three critical questions: Where are you?  Is there significant community transmission of the virus in your area?  Whom are we talking about?  Children are much less susceptible to severe outcomes from the virus than adults.  And what activities are we looking at?
There are more and less risky activities for schools, like keeping kids in the same classroom versus changing classes, avoiding large gatherings, and doing activities outside whenever possible.  Reopening schools comes with some risk, but there are risks to keeping kids at home too.
At home, kids aren’t benefitting from social stimulation.  They may be falling behind with learning.  They may be more vulnerable to abuse that goes unreported by the mandatory reporters in our school system.  They may not be getting special services they may need.  They may not be getting the nutrition that they get at school.  And it may be difficult for parents to get back to work, as Secretary Scalia noted.
This issue, like so many considerations around safely reopening, isn’t about health versus the economy, but about health versus health.  All of this is why the American Academy of Pediatrics has strongly recommended beginning with the goal of having students physically present in school.  This goal is the right way to use the extensive guidance that CDC has put out to help each state and school district think through a safe reopening.
Last week, we put out guidance around testing for K-through-12 schools.  This guidance, like our guidance for colleges and universities, offers recommendations for how and when students, teachers, and staff should be tested.
While CDC does not make a recommendation in favor of universal testing, it’s a perfectly appropriate surveillance technique where the capacity exists, and capacity is growing all the time.  We’ve talked with colleges and universities that are able to use their research lab capacity with pooling of multiple samples to test their whole student bodies and staff frequently, thanks to regulatory flexibility that CMS and the FDA have provided.
Many of the leaders we heard from yesterday at the White House School Reopening Summit are doing testing before returning to school, and then sentinel surveillance.
On top of that, the measures we recommend universally — like keeping a distance, wearing a face covering, and frequent hand washing — are effective and can be applied in the college or the K-through-12 setting.
We put out the CDC guidance to enable and support states and school districts in reopening safely.  We want them to use the tools available to reduce risk, and we’ll be putting out more guidance on how schools can use each of these tools, such as face coverings.
On top of that, I will reiterate that our set of tools is expanding all of the time.  Just yesterday, we signed a new agreement with Regeneron to provide nearly half a billion dollars in support for a promising therapeutic, all the way to manufacturing hundreds of thousands of doses for the American people.  The initial doses, pending approval, would be available as soon as the end of this summer or early fall.  That is the first of a number of therapeutic agreements that we will do under the President’s Operation Warp Speed initiative.
Promising therapeutics are already being administered every day by our heroic healthcare workers.  I want to thank these heroes who continue to put themselves at risk, caring for those suffering from the virus.  We know many frontline workers have gotten sick, and we know some have given their lives, including some of my employees in the Indian Health Service, and America is deeply grateful.
It is because we are making progress against the virus and learning more about it every day that we can talk about how to bring America’s kids and teachers back to school safely.  We have the tools to do it, and it has to be a top priority.
So thank you to President Trump and the Vice President for putting such a focus on this very important aspect of our road to recovery.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.

1:29 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  All right.  Hello, everyone.  Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future.  The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities.  President Trump said, “After all, what do we want?  We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order.”  He went on to say, “We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities.  And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world.”  He went on to say, “We should all want the same thing.  How can it be any different than those things?”
This message is now more important and more timely than ever.  Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials — everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi.  Misguided movements, such as “Defund the Police,” seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever.  Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country.  An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families.  Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, “Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential.  Never forget: We are one family and one nation…We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so…they can build its future.”
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it’s an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I’ll take questions.
Peter.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-070620/

University of South Florida
Tampa, Florida
3:38 P.M. EDT
GOVERNOR DESANTIS:  Well, I want to thank the Vice President.  I want to thank Secretary Azar, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Birx for coming down to Florida, and also just for all the help that they provided throughout these many months.
You know, we are now in a situation where we are testing a lot more.  We also have a greater percentage of people testing positive.  I mean, throughout May and early June here in Hillsborough County, for example, I think they were testing at about 3 or 4 percent would test positive.  Now, we’re looking at places like Hillsborough and in Orange County, no longer 3, 4 percent but now 15 percent of folks are testing positive.  Obviously when you’re testing about 60,000 people a day — we’re getting results like that over the last week — that’s going to generate a lot of additional cases.
So we were discussing some of the things that we may be able to do going forward, including pooling, types of testing in conjunction with our universities — which I think will be really, really good.  We also spoke with some of the hospital systems here — Tampa General, BayCare — about other ways that we could be helpful.
You know, one of the things — if you go back to March when we, kind of, faced the initial wave of this, I mean, we had very few tests relative to what we have now.  Now hospitals test — anyone that comes in for something, they can test.  You know, we, between the state, we’re doing 10 to 15 thousand tests a day at all the different sites.
There was a question about PPE.  We’ve got PPE; hospitals have it, the state has it.  You know, we’re good to go there.  There was no treatment of any kind, really, for this.  It was totally novel.  The physicians have learned a lot.
And then, through Secretary Azar and HHS — I remember coming down, I think at the end of April, to visit Tampa General.  They asked about remdesivir.  We called Secretary Azar; they’ve been sending a bunch of the remdesivir down.  So the physicians are using that.  They’re using convalescent plasma.  And they are having definitely better results.
And then we also — even though we took a lot of action early to protect the long-term care facilities — since March, we have increasingly brought on COVID-only dedicated nursing facilities.  And so we now have 12 of these facilities throughout the state of Florida.  We have one in Pinellas, one in Polk, which the Tampa Bay hospitals can use and nursing homes can use.
And basically, the idea is: If you have somebody test positive in a nursing home, you don’t want that to spread to the other residents.  That individual is medically stable; they can be transferred to the COVID-only facility.  If they need hospitalization, obviously they go to the hospital.  But if they end up becoming stable while in the hospital, rather than be discharged back to that facility, which would create problems, you have a place to go to be able to discharge that.
So all around the state now we’ve got 750 beds in COVID-only nursing facilities.  And so we just brought one on in Miami.  We now have one in Broward, two in Palm Beach, two in southwest Florida, Brevard County, Jacksonville, Escambia, and Tallahassee.
So, pretty much anywhere around the state, if you have somebody who is a resident of a long-term care facility, that’s in the hospital, that’s medically stable but still contagious, you have a place where they can be safely transferred.  So we think that that’s something that’s very, very significant.
The message that we’ve really been sending for folks in Florida: I think because we had such a quiet May — because, you know, the positivity was so low, the caseload was so low — it kind of fell out of the news at the end of May, beginning of June, and I think people weren’t as focused on it anymore.  And now, obviously we’ve seen these cases.  So I think people are more focused on it.
But basically, the message is, you know, for those folks who are 65 and older, people that have significant underlying medical conditions, you know, do your best to avoid crowds and minimize close contact with people outside your home right now.
We have the virus community transmission, particularly with younger people.  If you look at where — you go back a month, the median age of our cases was in the 50s.  Now the median age of the cases here in Hillsborough County for the entire pandemic has dropped to 34.  And there’ll be days where we’ll get cases in Hillsborough County and the median age will be under 30.  In Orange County, the median age for the whole pandemic is now 32.  There’s days where it’ll be 28 and 29.  So it’s been a huge shift.
The case growth has really been in that 18 to 34, 35 age group.  Now, those are folks that are, by and large, going to be much less prone to significant consequences.  Nevertheless, with the increasing positivity rate, it’s clear that you’re seeing more and more community transmission really being driven by that age group.
And so if you’re someone in one of the medically vulnerable conditions or you’re an older person, you know, just understand that that’s out there, continue to be vigilant.  I think folks in Florida — the seniors — have been very, very vigilant throughout this whole time.  We still want to ask people to be able to do that going forward.
And then for, kind of, the general public, you know, we’re telling people to avoid the three Cs: you know, closed spaces.  In Florida, it’s hot.  People don’t want to be outside in 95-degree heat.  Just understand, if you’re getting together in closed spaces with poor ventilation, that is going to be a much better vector for this virus to be able to spread.
We’re also saying avoid large crowds.  Now, we had for a long time a 10-person gathering limit.  We’ve advised, you know, not to do more than 50.  But I would say the smaller the group, the better for that.
And then also, the close contact.  If you’re in really close, sustained contact with somebody, you’re going to be more apt to see transmission of this virus.
So avoid the three Cs.  Stay safe and take care of yourself during this holiday weekend.
I want to bring up the Vice President just to thank him.  He came down, I remember, at the very beginning of this in March.  We went down and met with the cruise line folks.  He’s always been there to help us as we’ve needed different things, and, you know, we have needed things from time to time.  And so I really want to thank him for being a friend to the state of Florida, being a friend to the people of Florida, and really never leaving this fight.
I mean, even as we saw numbers go down across the country in May, you know, now we see a Sun Belt resurgence, and he’s been, I think, all over the Sun Belt just in the last few days.  So we’ve already discussed ways that they can help Florida going forward, and I know that they’re going to be able to deliver on that.
So I want to — it’s my, really, honor to be able to welcome yet again to the state of Florida, our Vice President Mike Pence.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Governor DeSantis.  Thank you for your leadership.  The people of Florida deserve to know that from the very beginning of this pandemic, Governor DeSantis and his healthcare team have formed a seamless partnership with our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force.
And whether it be in testing, whether it be in personal protective equipment, whether it be in the distribution of therapeutics like remdesivir, or whether it be in advancing the kind of mitigation efforts that have kept Florida low for a long time until just a few short weeks ago — Governor, I want to thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and your partnership.
And I want to thank all the people of Florida for all of your efforts over the many months, and to say to each and every one of you, what we said to the Governor today is: We’re with you.  And at President Trump’s direction, we’re going to make sure that your governor and the state of Florida have what you need, when you need it, to meet this moment of rising cases across the state.
We really are here to assure the people of Florida that, as we — as we see the rising cases not only in this state but across the Sun Belt, that we’re going to do whatever it takes to make sure that our extraordinary healthcare workers have the resources and the support and supplies.
The Governor and I talked today about personnel, and we’ll be considering a request from the state of Florida about medical personnel that we’ll be processing in very short order.
But, Governor, I also want to thank you for your efforts.  I want to thank you for your efforts to open up Florida again.  We had good news this morning as a nation: Nearly 5 million jobs created in the month of June, including many here in the state of Florida.  It was the largest one-month increase in history.  And Florida, being an economic engine for the United States, played a key role in that.
But I also want to say, Governor, that we fully support your prudent steps in working to slow the spread and the rise in cases that are impacting Florida today.
As we said at a task force meeting not long ago, it’s — and I’d say to the people of Florida: It’s not an either/or choice.  If all of us will put into practice the guidance from state and local officials — which is wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask when it’s indicated by local officials, or wear a mask when you can social distance — we know that we can do what Florida did for those many months and what other impacted areas around the country did.  We can slow the spread.  We can flatten the curve.  But it’ll take all of us to do it.  And I just want to reassure you, Governor, that we’re going to be working with you to make sure that Florida has all the resources.
The economic comeback that’s underway is a — is a demonstration that we don’t have to choose between opening up America and the health of our people.  We can do both.  And that’s the challenge that we face today across the Sun Belt.
And we just want to encourage, with great respect, all Floridians to put these principles into practice and know that we’re going to stay with you every step of the way.
I do want to say that we’re encouraged today to hear a report from the Governor that, particularly in the category of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, that Florida’s hospitals are in good shape.  We also are pleased to hear the hospital capacity remains strong in this state.
We’re informed there’s about more than 13,000 total hospital beds available at this time.  Availability, 22 percent of hospital capacity.  Ventilators, which were an issue before our nation four months ago, at the beginning of this pandemic, are in abundant supply.  We’re told that there’s more than 5,500 ventilators available across the state of Florida.
And at President Trump’s direction, we worked with companies across the country.  We’re well on our way to manufacturing 100,000 ventilators in 100 days, and in just a matter of the next two weeks, we’ll have 50,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile.  And should the need arise anywhere here in Florida, we want to assure you, Governor, and all your healthcare workers that the resources will be there.
We’re also encouraged to hear that personal protective equipment remains in abundant supply in the state.  The federal government has shipped literally millions of N95 masks, surgical masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves, but we’ll continue to make sure that those resources flow to the great healthcare systems that we had the opportunity to meet with today.
As you’ll hear in a moment, too, from the director of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, we’re also making steady progress in distributing therapeutics, or medicines, to treat people that are suffering the symptoms of the coronavirus.  And I’m pleased to report to your governor today that, just yesterday, the latest shipment of remdesivir arrived in Florida — 34,000 vials of remdesivir that’s — that will literally treat thousands of patients in this state.
That, combined with other innovative treatments like steroids and convalescent plasma, we literally are — we’re in a much better place than even two months ago to be able to treat people who have contracted the coronavirus.
And I hope that — I hope that that message, more than anything else, comes through today to the people of Florida — is to understand that we are, because of all we’ve done as a country, because of President Trump’s leadership in standing up a whole-of-America approach — manufacturing supplies, innovating in testing, developing therapeutics, and well on our way to developing a vaccine — we hope and trust, perhaps even by the end of this year, that we are in a much better place to confront the rising cases that are impacting here in Florida and all across the country.
And so I want people to be vigilant, but we want people to be encouraged that we’re going to make sure your governor and the state of Florida has everything you need to meet this moment and do what Florida has been doing from the very beginning, and that is putting the health of the people of this state first.
And let me also say, with great admiration to the people of Florida, that the record of Florida in protecting the most vulnerable is among the best in the nation.  And, Governor, your steps — your steps to protect residents of long-term care, to create those COVID-only facilities, to do the kind of testing that’s — the record in Florida really speaks for itself.  And we commend you for that, and we’ll continue to support your efforts.
Governor, President Trump and I are absolutely committed to supporting your efforts to respond to this outbreak in Florida, to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable, to get our kids back to school, and to keep opening up our economy.
But lastly, let me say to all my fellow Americans all across Florida: We all need to do our part, and we once again want to specifically encourage younger Americans in Florida.  It’s one of the unique things — I was in Arizona yesterday, I was in Texas over the weekend, and as we discussed with your governor, it’s a truism of this moment in the pandemic that some 50 percent of all the new cases are Americans under the age of 35.
And to each and every one of you, let me just say from my heart: I know you know that without a serious underlying health condition, that the threat of the coronavirus to younger Americans is very, very low.  But no younger American would ever want to put at risk a grandmother, a grandfather, a mom, a dad, an elderly neighbor, or a friend by inadvertently exposing them to the coronavirus.
And that’s why we encourage you to be vigilant, to heed state and local guidance, and to respect those who are most vulnerable, in particular.  And just know that if all of us do our part, we’ll get through this.
I can’t help but feel that the resilience and the strength and the character of the American people shown forth today, that even in these challenging times, we’re continuing to see America’s economy coming back and America going back to work.
And I’m just absolutely confident, if all of us do all that we need to do, we’ll do what we’ve done before in other parts of the country and what Florida did for so many months: We will slow the spread, we will flatten the curve, we will save lives, and we will bring Florida and America’s economy back bigger and better than ever before.
With that, I’m going to invite to the podium a couple of members of our team.  Dr. Deborah Birx has been the White House coordinator, been our lead scientist on all matters.  And after her, we’ll hear from the Secretary of HHS briefly, and the head of the FDA, to share with you what we heard today and what we’re seeing.
But, Governor, once again, thank you for your leadership.  And to all the people of Florida: We’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you until that day comes that we put the coronavirus in the past here in Florida and all across America.
Thank you and God bless you.
Deb?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  It’s a pleasure to be here with all of you today.  And I want to start where the Vice President left off: that we all have a critical role to play in the next few weeks.
We were watching this area, Tampa, very closely — through March, through April, through May, through your reopening.  And for days after days, weeks after weeks, we saw you sitting at 4 percent, which everybody, including the World Health Organization, said is a safe place to be.
At end of May, we began to see your numbers increase and go from a very low of 4 percent at the end of May to this high now of 17 percent.  So this virus came to Tampa and spread through Tampa sometime along the end of May, and then spread through the asymptomatic groups that don’t, as described, get symptoms and constantly spread, and to the point where you have this number of cases today.  And we all have a critical role to play over the next two to three weeks to stop that spread.
To every Floridian: We know what works, in addition to the hand washing and the social distancing, wearing masks, and not having large gatherings inside, not having large gathering outside.  But if you participated in a large gathering in the last four weeks, we ask all of you to come forward and be tested because of the level of asymptomatic spread.
So we’re asking for everyone under 40 that, if you were in a gathering, please go and get tested.  Please wear a mask.  Please do all of the hygiene issues.  And please stay away from those who have comorbidities.
Of course, the governors and mayors are all acting together to really extend and stay safe for everybody in Florida.  But also, the federal government has a role, and that’s why it was exciting to be here today to talk to the University of South Florida and your brilliant scientists and physicians here to really start to implement pooled testing.  That is our breakthrough that we’ve been working on for three weeks.
We think that Florida and this university and this particular county is a great place to start.  How can that be utilized?  It can be utilized three ways.  One way is going into neighborhoods and testing whole families into a single tube.  And then if anybody is positive, you would go back, use your contact tracing to test everyone in the household.
It is easy for them to test themselves by just the front of their nose into the transport media, coming back here, working with your research community to run those tests, going back then and testing the positive households and ensuring those that are positive remain quarantined and isolated for the next couple of weeks.
It’s the role for the federal government to support that enhanced testing.  FDA has put out new guidelines to encourage it.  We have put guidelines up on the White House website.  They’ve been there for three or four weeks, but we really need to act on them and have a partnership, like here today, bringing together community with scientists and the medical field to really take that next step.
That can also be used in screening large numbers of school students, because you can put 10 into one tube.  So you can do a classroom with retest.
This is groundbreaking for putting people back to school and keeping universities open, where you could test an entire dorm probably with 10 to 15 tests, always with the ability to go back and do individual diagnostic tests for the pools that are positive.
We think that this is a critical breakthrough.  As the FDA continues to bring new testing online, this would allow us to go from 5,000 tests a day to 50,000 tests a day.  And for in Florida, that would be a log increase that we could support and continue, and we want to encourage that but we want to work alongside you.
And as the Vice President said, of course we are here to support your medical community — and you’ll hear from Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar — but we’re here also as the federal government so that you know that you have our continuous support.
There are things that we have to do together as individuals that established this great nation.  It’s a privilege to wear red, white, and blue today.  I don’t often get — you only get to do that a couple of times a year, so it’s a privilege to be here celebrating the birth of our country and asking each American citizen, particularly Floridians, to do the responsible thing of wearing a mask, protecting others.
And we, as a state and local, and federal government, will walk beside you and help with all of those innovations to bring us to a different place — lower those cases and stop the spread.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, Governor DeSantis, thank you for having us here and for welcoming us again to Florida and for being here in Tampa.  Boy, I learned a lot.  I learned a lot from the University of South Florida and Tampa General.  Got a long list of actions coming out of this really tremendous session that we get so much value from.
And thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of our all-of-America approach to defeating this virus.
I want to begin by thanking the healthcare workers and also the members of the HHS team that are working here in Florida and across the country to beat this virus.  They put themselves in harm’s way every day to help their fellow citizens, and we owe them all a deep debt of gratitude.
Thanks to the President and the Vice President’s leadership over the past several months, we at HHS and across the administration have built a six-point, all-of-America strategy to protect our country from the virus and, in time, defeat it.  And in each of these domains, as the Vice President said, we have advanced dramatically over just the last two months.  That’s surveillance, testing, containment, healthcare system resilience, therapeutics, and vaccines.
Here in Florida, thanks to the strong work by the state, we now have far more ability to track the spread of the virus than ever before.  We know that cases are rising quickly in parts of the state, but with the right data, as Dr. Birx said, we can target our approach and respond.
To support testing and containment, this week, CDC put out guidance around testing for higher education, as well as for K-through-12 students.
On therapeutics, we’ve distributed nearly 7,000 remdesivir treatment courses to Florida.  And this week, the President secured access to another 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir over the next three months, which will be allocated based on data that we continue to collect about the virus.
We’ve put out treatment guidelines for the use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids.  And we’re seeing promising data on the use of convalescent plasma, in terms — in the treatment of tens of thousands of patients.  These are three therapeutics that likely have already saved thousands of lives.
On vaccines: This week, the FDA put out guidance to accelerate progress toward a safe and effective vaccine.  Before a vaccine is ready, we’ll be working with states like Florida to plan for what distribution will look like.
Now, individuals will have a key role to play in our strategy.  You can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community by assessing the risks that you face.  Just think about three questions: First, who am I and whom do I live with?  Do age or underlying conditions put me at a higher risk?  Second, where am I?  Is the virus spreading where I live, and what are the recommendations of state and local authorities where I am?  And third, what am I thinking about doing?  Going to a crowded indoor place is riskier than an outdoor activity.
Practice physical distancing.  When you can’t keep a distance, wear a cloth face covering.  Always practice good hygiene, including hand washing.  These simple steps will make it much easier for us as a country to defeat the virus together.
So thank you all very much for being here, but thank you for everything that the people of Florida are doing not just to protect yourself and those you live with, but if you’re young, as was said earlier by the Vice President, you know the risk to you are quite low.  But you’re protecting vulnerable people in your household.  You’re also protecting the stranger standing next to you in the grocery store line, and you don’t know if that person is vulnerable, and you don’t want that on your conscience.
Practice social distancing, wear face covering, and practice good personal hygiene.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Stephen?
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the coronavirus task force.  It’s really been remarkable.  And, Governor, just, again, a remarkable effort, particularly protecting seniors in your state.
So I came to the job as FDA Commissioner after being a cancer doctor for over 30 years.  And I know the power of hope, but I also know that false hope can be damaging.  And what I saw today, the partnership of Tampa General and University of South Florida, gives me great hope.
What I saw was a partnership that developed a care plan that really accelerated and advanced the care of the patients with COVID-19 — something that we’re seeing across the country.  That is something that gives me great hope for Americans who might be afflicted with COVID-19.
President Trump asked the FDA to reduce regulatory barriers to getting medical products out to Americans during this time of a public health emergency.  And we set up something called the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.  And what we’ve seen over the last several months is just the incredible American biomedical research engine go forth.  We now have a number of therapies that are available for patients, and that also gives me great hope.
We have remdesivir, that’s been mentioned, which has been shown to reduce the stay of hospitalization in sick COVID-19 patients.
We’ve seen a trial that’s shown us that corticosteroids, dexamethasone, and others have the potential for reducing mortality by 30 percent in sick hospitalized patients.  And that has been mentioned here.  We have convalescent plasma, and convalescent plasma, of course, has been used for years for patients who’ve had infectious diseases, where you take the liquid protein portion of a blood that has the immunity, the natural immunity from someone who’s recovered from COVID-19, and you give that to someone who’s sick.
We’ve seen some early encouraging results in 20,000 patients that’s been shown to be safe.  And we have more than 28,000 patients in the U.S. who’ve been treated with convalescent plasma.  And we’ll get some relatively — we’ll get some news relatively soon on the data on the effectiveness of this.
But one thing I want to tell Americans: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, you should contact your local blood bank, the American Red Cross, because this could be lifesaving for someone with COVID-19, and it would be great for you to go and to donate and provide that opportunity to someone who’s afflicted with the disease.
Just a moment to tell you about other things: There are 141 clinical trials that are currently ongoing and overseen by the FDA.  There are more than 300 applications for therapeutics at the FDA right now.  So, again, this great American biomedical research engine continues; the pipeline is robust.
A little bit about vaccines: I want to congratulate Secretary Azar and his incredible leadership of the Operation Warp Speed.  In addition to Operation Warp Speed, there are a number of other vaccine manufacturers around the world that have vaccines that are in development.  We’ve authorized to proceed in clinical trial four vaccines, another six manufacturers are with us with applications, and another a dozen or more are actually talking to us about vaccines.
So in, record time, from identification of this virus, which we have to remember occurred in January, we have a vaccine that now is in the middle stages of clinical trials, and we expect two of have them to be in the later stages of trials — phase three trials in July.
As was mentioned, we did issue guidance with respect to vaccine development.  And one thing I want to assure the American people is that your FDA is on the job.  We will not cut corners in our assessment to the vaccine.  Our solemn promise to the American people is that we will look at the data associated with the vaccine, and we will make a decision about the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine using our typical high standards.
And so we all want, urgently, a vaccine.  I think we’re making really good progress.  I am cautiously optimistic, but FDA will be on the job, with respect to assessing its safety and efficacy.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Questions for me, any member of our team, or the Governor?  I think we’ve got a little bit of time.  Anyone?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-governor-desantis-florida-members-coronavirus-task-force-tampa-fl/

719,Trump,2020-07-01 11:43:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room 
4:43 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  So I am pleased to inform everyone that Seattle has been liberated.  The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, otherwise known as “CHAZ” — I think they switched their name to “CHOP,” but I’m told they went back to “CHAZ” — was a failed four-week Democrat experiment by the radical left.  And the results are in: Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured. 
     While the Democrat mayor of Seattle proclaimed that CHAZ was to be, quote, “the summer of love,” in fact, it was not.  And other failed Democrat politicians also remained passive, or even silent, in the face of anarchy.  But while that happened, President Trump set the tone: Law and order must prevail to preserve peace in our streets. 
     The President is not the Democrat governor of the state of Washington.  The President is not the Democrat mayor of Seattle.  But, nevertheless, the President must lead by example and be prepared to act in the face of failed Democrat leadership, which is what we saw in Democrat Seattle and Democrat Wisconsin.
     President Trump has always stood on the side of law and order, and we are pleased to report that law and order has prevailed, and Seattle has been liberated from the anarchists.
     In President Trump’s America, autonomous zones will have no sanctuary.  The BHAZ, B-H-A-Z — which stood for the Black House Autonomous Zone, across from the White House — was swiftly dismantled.  One hundred anarchists were arrested for rioting and destruction of federal property here in D.C; I believe that number is now above 300.  Four men have been charged in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  And there are 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. 
     You contrast the President’s vision of law and order to that of the failed CHAZ experiments and anarchy, and here’s what you find in the failed Democratic experiment that took place out in Seattle: The Seattle Times said the shooting at Seattle’s CHOP protest tragically killed a 16-year-old boy, leaving a 14-year-old “seriously injured.”  That’s what happens in an autonomous zone. 
     The police chief, Carmen Best, who did a marvelous job winding down the CHOP zone noted that CHOP has become “lawless and brutal” and “enough is enough,” and she took action.  According to reports, quote, “Police also investigated several vehicles circling the CHOP zone” with “people inside carrying firearms and wearing body armor.”  This was no, quote, “summer of love,” as the Democrat mayor in Seattle said.
     And President Trump compelled action.  He has said, “Take back your city NOW.  If you don’t do it, I will.”  He has said, “This is not a game.  These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY.  MOVE FAST!” 
     And finally, the Democrat mayor in Seattle, who was long delayed, finally gave the order to dismantle the CHAZ.  And it was an admission — it was an admission that President Trump’s vision is right, that anarchy is wrong, and that law and order bring peace.
     And with that, I’ll take questions. 
     Kristen.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-070120/

720,Trump,2020-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Governor Ducey of Arizona on COVID-19 | Phoenix, AZ",Nan,"Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
Phoenix, Arizona
12:57 P.M. MST
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  We just completed a thorough briefing with Governor Ducey and his healthcare team here in Arizona about this state’s response to the rising number of coronavirus cases, and I’m going to share a few reflections on what we’ve heard and that’s what we’re determined to do. 
But before that, let me take a moment to reflect on another aspect of this day — a huge win for the people of Arizona, for American workers, farmers, and ranchers — and that is that, as of today, the USMCA has taken effect.  It is, I am told, it — this state in particular sees trade with Mexico and Canada support 228,000 jobs, $20 billion annually.
And I want to take this opportunity particularly to thank Governor Doug Ducey for his efforts in moving the USMCA through the Congress.  As a candidate, President Trump committed to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that put American jobs, American workers, farmers, and ranchers first, and we’ve done that.  And that promise was kept when the USMCA took effect today.  So, Governor Ducey, you have our sincerest thanks.
President Trump asked us to be here today, with the dramatic rise of coronavirus cases in Arizona, to receive a briefing from Governor Ducey and the healthcare team about this state’s response to this pandemic. 
And I want to say, first and foremost, to Governor Ducey that, from the very first days of this pandemic, your leadership and your entire team in Arizona has really formed a seamless partnership with our administration, with the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  And up until roughly three weeks ago, Arizona had literally set the pace in slowing the spread, in flattening the curve.  And we’re grateful to you, to your team, and to all the people of Arizona for all of their efforts over the past four months.
But with cases rising dramatically — and not just here in Maricopa County, but all across Arizona — we wanted to be here to get a report from the ground.  We’ll take back what we heard here today.  We’ll ensure with the team that we brought with us, including the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security who oversees FEMA, to make sure that Arizona has what you need, when you need it.
We told the governor today and we say to the people of Arizona: We’re with you, and we’re going to make sure that Arizona has whatever it takes to meet this moment, to slow the spread, to flat- — flatten the curve, to save lives.  That’s our commitment to each and every one of you.
We also brought along Admiral John Polowczyk, who has coordinated all of the PPE supplies, the construction of ventilators.  And while we are encouraged to hear today that’s the — the hospital capacity here remains strong on supplies and equipment, we did hear in the briefing today for the need for personnel.
We’ve already responded.  Sixty-two medical personnel arrived this week in Tucson.  But the governor conveyed to us an additional request for another 500 personnel, and I’ve instructed the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security to move out immediately on providing the additional doctors and nurses and technical personnel.
We want to say to all the incredible healthcare workers here in Arizona: Help is on the way.  And we’re going to spare no expense to provide the kind of reinforcements that you will need all across this state should this — this coronavirus pandemic continue to expand in Arizona.
As I said, we were encouraged to hear that hospital capacity remains manageable: 88 — 85 percent of medical beds and only 88 percent of ICU beds.  But the governor and I also spoke today about two additional facilities that were already reviewed and developed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the governor knows that we’re prepared to stand those surge facilities up in very short order if the need should arrive.
We’re going to make sure that that Arizona continues to have the healthcare capacity in this state to render to everyone who contracts the coronavirus the level of healthcare that we would want any one of our family members to receive.
And finally, let me say: The President and I couldn’t be more grateful for Governor Ducey’s leadership throughout this coronavirus pandemic.  But with cases rising in the last several weeks, we want to make it clear that we fully support the steps that Governor Doug Ducey and local health officials are implementing here across the state of Arizona to slow the spread.
Arizona flattened the curve early on in this pandemic, but we all noted something changed about the middle of May.  And that’s why this governor has stepped forward, took decisive action to put the health of the people of Arizona first.  And President Trump and I fully support the responsible steps that he’s taken to limit large gatherings; to pau- — pause operations of bars and gyms, movie theaters, and waterparks; and delay the start of school until August 17th. 
President Trump and I and our entire task force are absolutely committed, Governor, to supporting your efforts to respond to this outbreak, to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable so that we can keep our economy moving forward and get our kids back to school. 
The CDC just today posted new guidance for getting our kids back to school; yesterday posted new guidance for opening up colleges and universities.  The governor and I discussed today the paramount importance of us moving forward in a way where we can get our kids back into the classroom come this fall. 
It’s been — it’s been tremendous leadership here in Arizona since the first days of this pandemic.  Your healthcare workers have done a remarkable job, particularly in recent weeks and at this very hour, caring for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus.  But I want to say to all the good people of Arizona: We all need to do our part.  And we want to encourage every Arizonan to adhere to the guidance that the governor has issued and also the guidance of local authorities. 
We issue a particular plea to young people.  I was informed today by the Maricopa County Department of Health that more than 50 percent of all of those who are testing positive in Maricopa County are under the age of 35.  And young people know that, without an underlying health condition, that the threat to them of a serious outcome for the coronavirus remains low.  But we want to remind our young people: As you see the measures that the governor has put into place and you hear about the call for commonsense personal hygiene and the wearing of masks that this is about protecting our most vulnerable.
I’ve got three 20-somethings in my family, and I know that no young person here in Arizona would want to inadvertently expose a grandmother, or a grandfather, an elderly neighbor, a mom, or a dad to the coronavirus. 
And so to each of them, we want to commend all the steps the governor has put into place.  But we want to remind you that now is the time for all of us, particularly the young among us, to remember to wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask when indicated by state or local authorities or when social distancing is not possible.  We can all do our part to slow the spread, to flatten the curve, to save lives. 
And remember, it’s not an either/or.  Dr. Fauci said, not just a few short days ago, that we shouldn’t look at these public safety measures as an impediment to continuing to open up our economy; we should look at them as a vehicle to opening up.  The more we all do to support the public health measures that have put into effect, the quicker we can get Arizona’s economy growing, get our kids back to school, and that’s we’re determined to do. 
We’re all in this together.  And together, I’m very confident that, as all of us do our part each and every day, we’ll slow the spread, we’ll flatten the curve, we’ll save lives all across this state, and we will lay a foundation to bring this state’s economy back bigger and better than ever before.
So thank you very much.  And, Governor Ducey, thank you for an important and informative briefing.  We’re with you.
GOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President. 
I want to say thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership and your partnership throughout this pandemic.  It was great to see you today in person, but I’m able to see you at least once or twice a week on the constant communication that we have from the Coronavirus Task Force.  We very much appreciate it — your commitment and President’s — Trump’s commitment to serving Arizona and helping us solve the issues that are in front of us today.
I also want to thank the Coronavirus Task Force — to have Secretary Chad Wolf here today; Rear Admiral Polowczyk, who is talking to us about supplies; and Dr. Deborah Birx, who has been with us for several days in Arizona, meeting with leaders, decision makers, and influencers in the healthcare industry across our state, and actually seeing what’s happening across the Southwest, including New Mexico and Texas.  We’re grateful for what she has been able to contribute to the discussion, the questions she was able to answer, and guidance that she was able to clarify. 
I also want to thank General McGuire and Dr. Cara Christ, who are working with their counterparts in the federal government, and the hard work that they have been doing. 
And most of all, I want to say thankful — thank you to our healthcare workers who are on the front lines — our doctors, our nurses, our hospital staff, and all of our caregivers.  The decisions that we are making are to help you help the people in Arizona that need it. 
So our message is clear, in terms of where Arizona is today: You are safer at home.  We want to slow the spread of this virus and protect the most vulnerable.  We have taken the steps to temporarily close bars and gyms and waterparks, tubing, and movie theaters. 
We focused for a long time, and have done a very good job, on our most vulnerable — those that are 65 years or older and at high risk or with chronic health issues.  We now need the message to spread far and wide that we all can contribute to slowing the spread of this virus and have Arizona a safer place by following the fundamentals of masking up, washing your hands, maintaining that physical distance between others, and when you’re sick, staying home.
If we commit to that, and we do it with increased intensity over the next several weeks, we’re going to be in a different and better position in Arizona. 
So with that, again, I want to thank our federal partners, Vice President Pence and President Trump.  Whatever we have asked for and needed — whether it was increased testing or further support on contact tracing, personal protective equipment from face guards to gowns — the answer has been yes, and with urgency, in addition to helping clarify some federal guidance that will help our hospitals here on the ground with support and resources.
So I couldn’t be more grateful for your partnership and leadership in this battle.  It’s something we need to remain vigilant on, and also have flexibility to work with our local leaders across the state who have done an incredible job communicating the benefits of putting on a mask and how that can help our fellow citizens slow the virus and protect the most vulnerable. 
And with that, I want to turn the podium over to Secretary Wolf of Homeland Security, who has been an incredible partner as well on everything that Arizona has needed — not only with the focus from FEMA, but whatever issues we’ve had at the border, as well.  For that, we’re grateful.
Secretary Wolf.
SECRETARY WOLF:  Let me first start off by again thanking the Vice President for his leadership of the Coronavirus Task Force and the team that he’s really put together, several of which are here today.  It’s really been outstanding.
Let me also thank Governor Ducey, again, for your leadership throughout the pandemic, but particularly over the last several weeks as you’ve seen cases increase here, and again, for the team that you’ve pulled together as well.
DHS continues to proudly support Arizona and all the states that are continuing to respond to the pandemic.  We have done so.  We have obligated more than 90 million to the state of Arizona for National Guard operations, for alternative care facilities, other emergency protective measures, and we’ll continue to do that.
Let me also say that, again, through Admiral Polowczyk’s great efforts, we’ve been able to send over 318 million units of PPE to the state of Arizona as well, and we’ll continue to surge as we need to do that as well.
The Governor mentioned the border.  We continue to look at any threats that are coming across the border, and we put in some essential restrictions several months ago to make sure that we slowed the spread while keeping essential traffic and that trade occurring across your southern border — our southern border — Arizona’s southern border. 
It’s absolutely critical to the economies along that border into the U.S. economy, and we want to make sure that we get that right.  We’re continuing to assess that on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis to see if there’s any changes that we need to make.  And we’ll certainly talk about that at the task force.
But let me just end by again thanking the governor for his efforts throughout the pandemic.  And I will say, as we deal with the pandemic, we’re also dealing with other incidents that are going on throughout the country. 
So the governor’s strong support for law and order is vitally important in these days as the department is the country’s largest law enforcement agency.  And so we stand ready to support our state and local partners as we’re protecting federal facilities, we’re protecting monuments and statues, and the like.
So I want to again thank the governor for his outstanding work as well.
DR. BIRX:  Mr. Vice President, Governor Ducey, it’s been a privilege to be with the people of Arizona for the last two or three days.  What has been remarkable to me is watching the people of Arizona respond to the “Mask Up” Arizona guidelines that made it clear that we respect one another by wearing masks.  I saw that wherever I went for the last several days in Maricopa County, and I want to thank the people of Arizona for showing that respect for each other.
We know this virus is circulating actively in several counties.  We also know that there are other counties at risk, and I want to call on all the county leadership and the individuals in each of these counties that, as soon as you see an increase in your test positivity rate, to put on a mask, protect one another.
Governor Ducey’s directive is to really increase our — not only our respect for one another, but that clear communication coming from his health team that made it clear that wearing a mask will change the spread of this virus.  And also making it clear that, with this moment in time, closing the bars, decreasing restaurant spaces, and the other actions will really dramatically having an impact.
To all of our Millennials and Gen Z, thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and showing how important the mask and social distancing are, and that communication that you’re having with your parents and your grandparents to protect them. 
But I also want to call on you to be aware that there are people in your age group — people in your age group, every day, that have preexisting conditions that you may not know about — that may have diabetes, that may have hypertension, that may have a weight issue.  These individuals, no matter what their age, are susceptible.  And you can see it in the hospitalizations here in Arizona.  So you’re not only protecting those we totally respect in the over-65 age group, but you’re protecting one another.  And I appreciate that. 
Yesterday, I got to meet with an entire group, and it showed the Governor’s commitment and the health commitment of Dr. Christ to understanding guidelines don’t work unless they’re translated and working alongside community members. 
So in that meeting — for community members from the Hispanic community, from the African American community, and today I got to meet with the tribal nation leaders — understanding that messages are not a standalone; that they have to translate into the very fabric of our communities so that people understand what their risks are, so that people can get tested, and so that people understand the importance of wearing a mask. 
I also saw incredible innovation of the American spirit.  We heard from your universities and we heard from your hospitals of the advances that you’re taking into the field and care for those who need us the most, and the innovations coming out of your universities to provide innovations and testing and really expanding testing. 
We talked about how to 10x testing through pooling and communities — communities that are in multi-generational households — bringing testing to the community and to those households, and using household pools to be able to test in 100 percent of the community. 
I want to thank the African American leader I met yesterday from the community who set up an African American task force to really make sure that messages from the Governor and the health team were being translated at the level of the people who needed to hear it. 
I thank you for bringing together and understanding that words that aren’t translated into actions will not stop this virus.  But I am encouraged and I am hopeful, and I am hoping we will see the dramatic impact of you all taking responsibility and wearing masks, so when it comes to August, we can open the schools and open the universities because we know we can stop the spread by utilizing masks and making these small adjustments into our lifestyle and show respect for one another. 
So thank you, Governor Ducey, for your leadership, for your looking at the science and the data and the evidence.  Thank you to your health team and the brilliant Dr. Christ.  It’s been a pleasure to spend time with you and your amazing county public health leaders who understand how to get into the community.  Thank you for your time and the respect that you gave me by wearing masks in public. 
Thank you.
GOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you, Deb.

724,Trump,2020-06-30 11:32:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force | Rockville, MDxz",Nan,"United States Public Health Service Headquarters
Rockville, Maryland
4:32 P.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for joining us.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but it is a particular honor to be here at the headquarters of the United States Public Health Service to make an important announcement on the establishment of the Ready Reserve Corps.
And also, on behalf of the President and on behalf of entire team, to express our gratitude to the women and men who wear the blue uniforms across the country and have served our nation with such distinction and compassion over the past four months.
I’m — I’m here with several members of our team, who you will hear from in the course of this briefing.  But as we gather here today, more than 2.6 million coronavirus cases in the United States; sadly, we’ve lost more than 129,000 Americans.
The data report that we received today from Dr. Deborah Birx — who is, as we speak, in Arizona, briefing with Governor Ducey and their team — is that, at this moment, we have 12 states with rising cases and percent-positive cases — a combination of both rising cases and rising percent positive.  Beyond that, there are another 28 states that either have rising cases or rising positives but do not have a combination of those two things.
We also continue to see that roughly 50 percent of all the new cases are taking place in four states.  And so, as you would anticipate, we’re — we are working with governors and state health officials in all of the states that are impacted, but we’re particularly focusing on the four states that are generating the majority of the cases which, of course, are California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.
I’m pleased to say that, while there are 29 states that have — don’t have a combination of rising positivity and rising cases, we also have an additional 10 states that are either entirely stable or have numbers that are so low that they’re de minimis.  So our focus, particularly at the task force today, was on the 12 states that have the combination.
Beyond that, while one life lost is too many and we mourn the loss of every American and grieve with every family that lost a loved one, because of the dedication of our healthcare workers, because of our response and the response of the American people, we are grateful that, today, fatalities are at the lowest level since the end of March.
We continue to be vigilant as we see rising cases.  We understand that that could — that could change.  But again, to see the precipitous decline in fatalities is a tribute to the healthcare workers in this country and to the cooperation and the compassion of the American people.
Our message to every American in the states that are most affected by rising cases and rising positivity rates is: We are with you.  We are working with the governors in your state to ensure that they have the resources and the support to meet this moment and provide the level of healthcare that any one of us would expect for a member of our family.
But to all of the American people, I say, on behalf of the President of the United States and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that because of all that we’ve done over the last four months, we’re ready.  We’re in a much better place than we were four months ago or even two months ago.  And part of our briefing today will focus on the progress that we have made and our ability to respond to the outbreaks that we’re seeing occurring in states, particularly across the south.
I’ve been traveling across the country — I was actually in Texas over this past weekend; received a full briefing from Governor Abbott about their response — and I will be traveling to Arizona tomorrow, meeting with Governor Ducey.  And I’ll be able to confirm to him that we were informed today that a team deployed by FEMA of 62 Disaster Medical Assistance personnel are on the ground in Arizona.  We’re also currently processing a request from Texas, and we’re in consultation with other states.
As you will hear in a moment, with regard to testing, with regard to personal protective equipment, with regard to ventilators, with regard to therapeutic medicines, we are in a strong position all across the affected areas of the country to meet this moment.  But in consultation with the states, we’re — we’re going to make sure that they have the reinforcements in healthcare workers.  And I’m pleased to confirm today that 62 DMAT, or Disaster Medical Assistant Team, members have arrived in Arizona.
I’ll also be traveling later this week to the state of Florida, where Dr. Birx and I will also receive a briefing, along with Secretary Azar, about that state’s response.
At the present moment, all 50 states in the country are reopening and have done so in one degree or another since the beginning of May, when we issued our Guidelines to Open Up America Again.
At this moment in time, because of the rising cases, at least four states have taken action to close down bars, limit capacity in restaurants, and another 10 states have slowed down or postponed certain reopening efforts.
And let me make it very clear that we fully support the new guidance that’s been issued by the governors in these states.  We truly do believe that these prudent measures and additional guidance and steps will make it possible for us to continue to move our nation forward, to continue to reopen in a safe and responsible way, while putting the health — the health of our citizens first.
I thought Dr. Fauci put it well in a recent task force meeting when he said, and I think also testified today, that we “should not look at public safety measures as an impediment to opening up America, [that] rather, we should look at them as the vehicle to opening up,” as we see rising cases in particularly those 12 states where we have a combination of rising cases and positivity.
The American people deserve to know that our best health experts say it’s not an either/or.  It’s not whether we continue to open up or whether we move in an opposite direction, but rather it’s whether we take these prudent measures that will slow the spread and put the health of our citizens first.
Our governors in the affected areas and their public health officials are making — are taking strong action to keep their states open, while slowing the spread and putting the health of their citizens first.  And they have our full support.
Let me say again, as I said at the outset: The American people deserve to know that we’re in a much better place today, thanks to the whole-of-government approach, the whole-of-America approach that President Trump initiated at the very outset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The — working in cooperation with agencies across the federal government, working with the private sector across this country, we literally have scaled — now 33 million tests have been performed across the United States.
And as Admiral Brett Giroir will detail momentarily, we’re — we’re testing between 500 and 600 thousand Americans every single day, with the capacity to significantly increase that through the innovation of what is known as “pooling.”
And when it comes to medical supplies, FEMA has facilitated the delivery of literally billions of gloves and gowns and masks.  And as Admiral Polowczyk will detail in just a few moments, we are in continuous contact with not just states, but with hospitals in states across the country.  And we continue to receive very strong reports about the support they’ve received and the supplies that are available to meet this moment.
Also, we’re in a much better place because of the availability of what’s known as therapeutics or medicines to treat people that have contracted the coronavirus and are experiencing severe symptoms.
Now, Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA is here, and he will speak about the progress that we are making, whether it be the availability of remdesivir, which we’re distributing another tranche this week; the use of blood plasma, of steroid treatments; and — also, we continue to hear very hopeful signs about the continuing — continuing progress for developing a vaccine for the American people.
And so, with that, I’m going to — I’m going to yield to the team here to give you updates.  I’m going to begin with Secretary Azar, who will update us on our national response, including important work the CDC did today with regard to opening up our schools again.  And then Admiral Giroir will update us on testing, Admiral Polowczyk on supplies, and Dr. Hahn on medicines.  And then, finally, we’ll hear from Dr. Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General of the United States, who will give counsel to every American in the states that are impacted and all across the country about best practices.
So to every American in states that are seeing rising cases and rising trends in positivity: We want — we want to assure you we’re with you.  And we’re deploying, at the President’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to meet this moment and working in strong partnership with your state and local officials.
And to every American: We want to assure you that we’re ready, more ready than ever before, to meet this coronavirus pandemic because of the — because of the resources that our President, that agencies at the federal government, the steps deployed and efforts at state government, and mostly because of what the American people have done and demonstrated that they have the ability to do.
I mean, the truth is, while we’ve made great progress on making availability of testing and supplies and medicines, we all need to do our part.  We know how to slow the spread.  And the commonsense measures that we outlined in our phased approach to open up America again, the guidelines that apply to all of the phases are — ought to be embraced by every American: wash your hands, practice good hygiene, and wear a mask.  Wear a mask when — whenever your state and local authorities say it’s appropriate.  It’s always good idea to wear a mask when social distancing is not possible.
We’re all in this together, and we have every confidence that as we met the moment before when we saw this pandemic first strike in the northwest and then strike so hard around the Greater New York City area, then New Orleans, then Michigan, that with a with a — with a whole-of-government approach, a whole-of-America approach, cooperation of the American people, we’ll do what we did earlier on in this pandemic: We’ll slow the spread and we’ll save lives.
And with that, Secretary Azar and members of the team will brief, and then we’ll have time for questions.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President, for honoring HHS and the Commissioned Corps with your presence today.  And thank you for your leadership of the President’s all-of-America response to COVID-19.
I’d also like to thank Admiral Giroir and Vice Admiral Adams for their service during this crisis and for their dedication to strengthening the Commissioned Corps.
The men and women of the Commissioned Corps have been and will continue to be central to our COVID-19 response and on all six points of our strategy to defeat the virus: surveillance, testing, containment, healthcare capacity, vaccines, and therapeutics.
To every member of the Commissioned Corps who’s gone into harm’s way in this crisis, who’s spent time away from home and loved ones, we are deeply grateful.
I want to mention one particular step forward we took today to help Americans get back to work and back to school while protecting us from the virus: new guidance from the CDC as to how higher education institutions can protect students and their employees.  In particular, it offers recommendations for how and when testing should be used for students, faculty, and staff, including both testing for symptomatic individuals and testing for asymptomatic individuals who’ve had possible exposure to the virus.
The guidance also notes that in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, where resources allow, colleges and universities can work with local health officials to consider testing asymptomatic students and staff who have no known exposure.  This may make sense in order to identify outbreaks and inform control measures, and would especially apply to groups like those living in congregate housing.
This guidance relies on what we’ve learned about the virus in recent months.  In the very near future, we will also be releasing similar guidance around K-through-12 schools, recognizing how important safe schools are to reopening our country.
These are just two examples of the science-based resources that we’re providing for state and local health departments and other institutions as they work with federal assistance to continue the fight against the virus and to reopen our country.
We need to reopen America.  We have to get back to work, back to school, back to worship, back to healthcare.  But we must all play our individual parts to enable this reopening.  We can reverse these outbreaks and prevent future ones by doing what the President has called for since the beginning in his guidance: practice social distancing, wear facial coverings where social distancing is not possible, and practice good personal hygiene.
By doing so, you protect yourself, you protect vulnerable household members, but you also protect the person you may be standing next to in the grocery line.  And you don’t know whether they’re vulnerable.  You have no way of knowing whether they’re at high risk of severity, hospitalization, or fatality.  You protect them.
There’s just three simple steps to keep reopening: social distance; wear facial coverings when you can’t social distance; and practice good personal hygiene.  It’s all we need to do to keep reopening.  We can work, go to school, go to worship, reengage with healthcare, if we all, as individuals, practice good, responsible behavior to protect each other and to protect ourselves.
So thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well done.  Admiral?
ADMIRAL GIRIOR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mr. Secretary.  Again, you did us an incredible honor by being here and honoring and appreciating the 6,100 women and men of the Commissioned Corps.  We do say women and men; we are a 55 percent female service and the most diverse within the country.
I’m going to take a few minutes and talk about testing.  As both the Vice President and the Secretary said, we’re a world different than we were in March.  At that time in early March, we’d only done a few thousand tests.  Now we’re doing 550, 600 thousand.  We’ve actually gone over 600,000 per day, on occasion; over 33 million tests.
And I think all of you know there’s some components to this.  There’s, sort of, the front end — somebody to take the swab or to supervise you doing that swab.  You got to have the supplies there, you got to have the machines, and you got to have the laboratory tests.
So on the front end, way back in March, this had to be done by a practitioner, with a very deep nasal pharyngeal swab in full PPE.  We could not get to where we are today, from there, without a lot of science and a lot of collaboration from the FDA.
Because we’re able to validate nasal self-swabbing, those 41 sites turned into what you saw today, in the press, over 600 retail pharmacy sites that have now been extended for several months, continuing from their first June 30th closure now, at least through August, where there’s supervised self-swabbing.  That has translated into another 1,400 CVS sites.  So now 2,000 retail pharmacy sites, born from those first 41, in over 1,300 federally qualified health center sites.  Again, most of these focused on the most underserved communities and vulnerable communities.
So we’re scaling that, and every week we’re getting new authorizations from the FDA to take it the next step further, and that’s home self-swabbing.  There are some authorizations that are home self-swabbing and some that are video assisted, so we could eliminate a lot of the whole front-end problem where we are.
As I said many times, we’re scaling testing on a routine basis.  And I’ve told you that, assuming no technological innovations, we will easily be at 40 to 50 million tests available by September.  That’s a very conservative estimate — very conservative estimate — because the industry tells us we’ll be at a much higher place.
But what are some of the innovations we’re seeing right now being implemented, again, under the guidance of the FDA, validated, high quality?  And that’s pooling.  You’ve heard — you’ve heard something about pooling.  Pooling is very helpful because it could combine more than one sample in a single laboratory assay.
So imagine this situation where I wanted to know if all of you were potentially negative, and I thought you were probably negative because you don’t have a history, you’re not febrile, you haven’t been in contact with anyone.  So you could collect your own swabs, you can put them in tubes, and we can take all of those tubes, or at least 10 of them, and put them into a simple tube and do that assay.  If that one single assay is negative, then you’re all negative, if you do it appropriately.  So you can leverage 2 times, 5 times, possibly even up to 10 times or even more.
This is being done now in many universities and many commercial laboratories, and we are absolutely working with everyone in the community to do this.  It’s not right all the time, but it’s right a lot of the time.  So of those 18, 20 million tests per month that we’ll probably be doing in July, or out of those 35 to 50, 60 million tests we’re doing in September, you can do the math and multiply at least a portion of those by two, three, or even five.  So that’s where pooling is going to get us.
The final thing I would like to say is, the RADx program, that’s the diagnostics program at NIH, as well as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, are really making great inroads to innovation.  This was funded to sort of get us to the next step, to provide more rapid tests, higher quantities of tests, completely different kinds of tests.
Now, again, we’re not assuming any breakthrough innovations, but there’s going to be some, and I’m very excited about that.  The NIH Director Francis Collins, the BARDA Director Dr. Gary Disbrow, and I work on literally on a daily basis to make sure that the innovations that come on will be translated immediately to our public health system.
So I’d be happy to take your questions later on today.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Admiral Giroir, and thank you for your great efforts.  I know I speak for people all across this country when I express how proud we are of the extraordinary progress.
And the way we’ve scaled testing across America is historic.  When I was tapped to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we had done less than 8,000 coronavirus tests.  And to think that, in the intervening months, now 33 million tests and the ability to scale beyond that, it’s a — it is a great comfort to the American people and a great tribute — a great tribute to the public-private partnership that President Trump forged early on.
I think it’s also been historic to see the progress that we’ve made on personal protective equipment and particularly for Americans in the four states where 50 percent of the cases are occurring, or the 12 states where we’re seeing a combination of rising cases in positivity.  We want the American people to know that the personal protective equipment for our healthcare providers is also at a historic level.
And I’ve asked Admiral John Polowczyk to come and to articulate where we stand to date with the hospitals and healthcare facilities in the impacted areas, and our ongoing effort to ensure that the extraordinary doctors and nurses and healthcare workers that are, at this very hour, ministering to Americans struggling with the coronavirus have the masks, the gowns, the gloves, the ventilators, and all the personal protective equipment they need to render that care.
But Admiral Polowczyk?
ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you Mr. Vice President.  Back in March, mid-March, when I was moved from the Pentagon to FEMA, the President gave me one task: Provide our healthcare workers the supplies they need, what they need, when they need it.
And I’m going to give you a short update today, and I think the theme is: “We have more” — “They have more.”
So, from that time in March, mid-March until now, we are in a fundamentally better position.  I’m going to go through some details that makes me that confident.  And personally — those that personally know me, I’m a my glass half full type of person.  And so for these — these details I find very encouraging.
As we, over the last few weeks, tried to ascertain how well states and hospital networks are preparing, and preparing for the summer into the fall, we held a round of state calls with every state emergency manager and every state health official facilitated by the FEMA regional administrator.  So we went through every region and every state, and had a discussion about what we were doing for the National Stockpile and what they were doing for their states.
That call led me to believe that 65 to 70 percent of the states have at least 30 days of supply on hand, if not 60.  There are many states that have more than 60, that have targets of 90, and looking to achieve that.  Those state calls have made me confident of the numbers that we’re putting into our modernized National Stockpile.
Here in recent weeks, with the uptick in cases, where Dr. Birx has highlighted down to the county level, my team has called those hospitals.  And I am here to provide a synopsis of that.  We’ve talked to hospitals in Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, and on down the line.  Many of them are reporting 30 to 40 days of supply on hand.  Now, there are some sporadic shortages, but mostly in the size of — the size of masks.  “Could I have more small masks?”
So we took that information, and I talked to 3M today, as a matter of fact.  And they’ve already changed — based on the discussions with my team, they’re already changed their production to produce more small and extra-small masks.  So essentially, almost an even split — 40, 45, 50 percent were smalls, to then the — to the rest to normal supplies.
So states are saying they have supplies.  Hospitals and areas where there are outbreaks are having more supplies.
Another data tool: The National Health Safety Network, where — the CDC-run network where hospitals report days of supplies on hand across the nation — those supplies, back in March — there were many hospitals that were saying that they had less than three days.  Now folks have multiple weeks — the majority of hospitals.  So we are — we are fundamentally in a different place.
One of the things we did was we assembled all of the business-system data for the medical supply chain — for the commercial medical supply chain.  I have that (inaudible) at FEMA.  And I can see the demand from hospitals and the supply to them.  And those numbers are coming together, where supply is getting much closer to demand — all at the same time that states are stockpiling, municipalities are stockpiling, hospitals are stockpiling, and the federal government — with the Health and Human Services, Strategic National Stockpile — is being replenished.
So let me — let me shift topics to the nursing home project just real quick.  We’re on our second round of the nursing home project.  You know, those give a little bit more than a week’s worth of supply each.  Each round has, you know, almost 2 million sets of eye protection; 14 million masks; 63 million gowns — gloves; and 13 million gowns to get to the 15,000-plus nursing homes.  We’re 60 percent through this second round, and 45 percent have been delivered.
And finally, let me just touch on ventilators.  So back in March, the National Stockpile had approximately 19,000 ventilators.  Today, ready for deployment, we have 48,000.  By next week, if the production schedules hold, we’ll have 55,000.  So we are — we are in a fundamentally different place for supplies than we are.
Pending your questions later, Mr. Vice President, that’s all I have.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you.
And one other area where we’ve made great strides and we hope and pray to make good strides in the months ahead has been in the area of therapeutics and in the headlong pursuit of vaccines.  And when we see the extraordinary decline in fatalities over the last two months, it is a tribute, first, to our healthcare workers, to all that they’ve done — but it’s also a tribute to the availability of what are known as therapeutics — medicines like remdesivir; the new steroid treatment that you all have heard about; the availability of plasma treatments.
And I wanted to Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA to update us on the medicines, as well as where we stand on vaccines.
Dr. Hahn.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  President Trump asked the FDA early on in the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce any unnecessary regulatory barriers to get medical products into the hands of Americans.  And FDA created an emergency review and development program for therapies called the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, and we have supported that program since that time, and it continues to this day.
I’d like to first start by telling you that the pipeline of therapeutics treatments that we see across this country — the great academics, researchers, private sector — that pipeline is very robust.
Currently — currently, as a recent count, FDA is monitoring more than 144 active trials of therapeutic agents for COVID-19, and another 457 development programs for therapeutic agents is in the pipeline.
So we’re at a vastly different place than we were three months ago, two months ago.  The nation’s work is paying off, as we saw the positive results of the recent National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease trial of remdesivir in certain hospitalized patients with a significant 30 percent reduction in the length of hospital stay for severe COVID-19 patients.
We also recently updated the clinical guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, with the addition of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids, with a trial that reported a 30 percent reduction in mortality in severely ill patients.
Those two therapies alone will have a significant impact on the natural history and the course of this disease, and provides great hope for those who get sick with this and are hospitalized.
But our work isn’t done; more is in the pipeline.  As I mentioned, over 25,000 patients in the United States have been treated on our expanded access convalescent plasma program.  Now, just as a reminder, that’s where we take antibodies — the antibodies that are naturally developed by someone who has gotten the COVID-19 virus and then has recovered — and then we administer that to someone who’s sick with COVID-19.
This has worked in other diseases in the past.  We have some preliminary safety data in over 20,000 patients.  It shows that this therapy is safe.  And we’re currently evaluating the efficacy of this — the effectiveness of this program.  We have great hope for that.
Now that information will tell us a lot about, if a person develops antibodies, how protective are those antibodies — what level do you need.  And it also gives us information for the next set of therapeutics that are coming down the pike.
Already, in clinical trials, we have a number of agents called “monoclonal antibodies,” which are synthetic forms of antibodies — so, genetically engineered antibodies that can then be given.  Again, these have been used in other infectious diseases, and we have hope that they would also work in these disease — in COVID-19.  And we expect the readout of those trials over the next several months, possibly late summer and early fall.
So I just want to switch gears to talk about vaccines.  Under the leadership of Secretary Azar and Operation Warp Speed, we have seen the sponsorship of a number of different vaccines.  But we know that vaccines are being developed around the world, and FDA has received applications from a double-digit number of sponsors regarding vaccines.
Four vaccines have been approved for moving into clinical trials — that is, authorized to go into clinical trials so we can get the data on those vaccines — and another six are in the pipeline for us to review.
We’ve seen recent reports of interesting and, I think, positive data regarding the immunogenicity — that is, how well these vaccines stimulate an immune response in people and also regarding their safety.
More work needs to be done, but I think we’ve seen some positive results to date.  And obviously, we need to make sure that those studies mature so that we can have the data we need.
Now, FDA recognizes the need and urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19, and we’ve been working collaboratively with all industry and all of our partners in academia, as well as in government, on that.
Today, we took additional action to facilitate the timely development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 by providing new guidance with recommendations for those developing COVID-19 vaccines.  And the goal of this guidance is to assist in the clinical development, and ultimately, hopefully the licensure of a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
Now, it’s very important to have this guidance because it provides regulatory transparency and clarity to the developers — what is FDA expecting to see in terms of data and science in the context of clinical trials — so that we can make the absolute best decision for the American people.
Now, while the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in order to approve a vaccine, and we will make clear through this guidance what data are needed to meet our regulatory standards.
I remain cautiously optimistic about our timeline with respect to vaccines.  We will see what the data show.  But clearly, from a therapeutics point of view, there are more tools in the toolbox for the great providers of this country to treat patients with COVID-19.
And then finally, I’d like to add to what the Vice President said, and that is: Mask wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene, and other forms of hygiene — this is how we’re going to keep America open again.  I’ve heard from colleagues around the country, my former colleagues in cancer care, from friends and families — nobody wants to shut down again.  Our way of keeping open is with these public health measures.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Hahn.
And as you can see, we’re in a much better place, whether it be testing, whether it be personal protective equipment, whether it be ventilators, or whether it be the availability of medicines that are speeding relief to Americans struggling with coronavirus.
And I — and I promise you that, as the President has directed from the very beginning, we’re going to continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of governors and states that are being impacted by the latest outbreak of the coronavirus.
But as we said at the beginning, we’re all in this together and we all have a role to play.  And so I wanted to ask the Surgeon General to bring a few remarks about — about how every American can play their part to slow the spread, to put into practice the kind of personal habits that will ensure not just that they protect their own health or the health of a family member or friend, but most especially, as has been said already, we see that roughly half of the new cases in Texas and Florida, we are told, are among Americans under the age of 35, for whom the threat of serious outcomes from the coronavirus is fairly low.
But it’s not just about protecting yourself as a young person; it’s about making sure that anyone who is vulnerable to a serious outcome with the coronavirus is protected.  No one of any age would ever want to inadvertently expose a mother, a father, a grandmother, or a grandfather.
And what the Surgeon General will share with us are the kind of practices that will make it possible for all of us to do our part to slow the spread, to heal our land, even as we continue to open up America again.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Good evening, everyone.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here at Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Headquarters today.  We very much appreciate it.
And I just want to start off by saying that we absolutely cannot afford to lose focus on the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on vulnerable communities, particularly communities of color.
Compared to whites, American Indians and Alaskan Natives are hospitalized at five times the rate; black Americans hospitalized at four and a half times the rate; Hispanics three and a half times the rate.
The fact is, this virus is exploiting and exacerbating preexisting health disparities, and these disparate outcomes and equitable opportunities for health are part of the anger, the frustration, and the fear that we’re seeing manifest in protests around the country.
The fact is, social justice and social injustice often reveals itself through health inequities, and the administration and my office are using our unique levers, including the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, to ensure that every American has the opportunity to be healthy.
At Secretary Azar’s direction, we’ve been working at HHS to address these disparities long before the pandemic.  But in response to the pandemic, we’ve taken a number of additional immediate actions.  And as we’re talking about both the burden of disease in our communities, but the resources that are now available to folks to help respond, I want to quickly run down some of these efforts.
Admiral Giroir has led our increase in community-based testing — over 600 sites.  Seventy percent of them are in communities that have a high social vulnerability index, which means they’re disproportionately serving people of color.
CDC now requires all testing data reported by states to include information on race, ethnicity, and ZIP Code.  This mandate will help us better understand who is most affected and how to target interventions on the hardest-hit communities.  HHS recently allocated $15 billion to Medicaid providers and $10 billion to safety-net hospitals which serve large numbers of our most vulnerable Americans.
The administration has also invested critical resources in community health centers — which I often say are our best kept secrets — ensuring that 28 million people living in medically underserved areas have access to care and testing that they need.  We don’t want our federally qualified and community health centers to be secrets to the people who most can benefit from the care that they receive there.
And Secretary Azar — and I want to thank you for this, sir — has instructed my office to expedite calls to action on hypertension — which is the number one risk factor for COVID complications — and maternal mortality, both of which disproportionately impact people of color.  And I am very worried about infant mortality and maternal mortality going up in the midst of COVID because women are scared to go out and get care.  We need to safely reopen so that people can get the care that they need beyond COVID.
Last week, you heard Admiral Giroir announce that Morehouse School of Medicine was awarded $40 million as part of a cooperative agreement with the Office of Minority Health.  This effort will be a major leap forward and help us achieve our goal of delivering important COVID-19 updates and information in ways and through channels that best reach minority communities.
And speaking of reaching minority communities, we’re really digging into engagement with other folks.  So I had a phone call, last week, with over 100 different organizations that are embedded in communities.  Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the National Hispanic Medical Association, the National Association of Black Nurses, and over 100 other organizations were the phone call.  This administration — HHS — we’re committed to outreach to make sure that we can get the information to the people who most need to benefit from it.
And to the point of the VP’s visit here today.  One of the reasons I’m proud to be a leader in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is our mission to serve the underserved.  Having a Ready Reserve, which is the announcement that we made earlier today, will augment our efforts to eliminate health disparities and ensure everyone has the best chance at a long and healthy life.
One of eight uniformed services, the Public Health Service is the only one dedicated solely to protecting and promoting America’s public health.  By a number of metrics, we are the most diverse uniformed service.  Over 50 percent of our officers are female and only 40 percent identify as white and non-Hispanic.
We provide essential health services where most others do not go — dare not go, in some cases — to provide care for vulnerable and underserved populations.
The bulk of our officers are at Indian Health Service’s — Health Service’s facilities, and we have a large number of officers in the Bureau of Prisons — two communities that have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19.
We serve on the frontline of public health emergencies.  My first deployment was to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after three Category 5 hurricanes in a row hit those unfortunate territories.  We respond quickly to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and global public health emergencies like Ebola, as well as serve on humanitarian missions.
We also advanced innovation in science and work at the forefront of medical challenges like COVID-19, cancer, and the opioid crisis, providing new treatments and cures.
Which leads me to my finish.  We are in a much better place to treat COVID than what we were two months ago, four months ago, even just a few weeks ago.
You heard Admiral Polowczyk talk about how we are better supplied than what we were.  Doesn’t mean that it’s mission accomplished, but we are in a much better place now with PPE and with other supplies.  With steroids, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma, if you get COVID-19, we are in a much better position to get you out of the hospital safely.
But public health is all about prevention.  And I’m a leader in the Public Health Service Corps.  So, I want to talk about prevention.  My Surgeon General’s prescription — which I first announced to you all way back in March — three things: Number one, know your risk.  Are you at high risk?  Are you at low risk?  Are you at intermediate risk for COVID-19?
Number two, know your circumstances.  Are you in a community where rates are going up?  Are you in a community where rates are going down?  Are you going to a place where you can take precautions like being outside and social distancing?
And number three, know how to stay safe.  And that includes everything from making sure we’re taking basic precautions, to staying home if you’re at high risk or you’re going to a high-risk place.
The fact is, we’re seeing an increase in cases and an increase in hospitalizations in those under 40.  So we need everyone to follow our preventive guidelines.  Stay home if you’re sick.  Stay at home if you’re vulnerable.  And again, we know people are more vulnerable as they get older, but they’re also vulnerable if they have hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.  Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently went out.  Maintain six feet of distance between you and others when you’re out.  And please, please, please wear a face covering when you go out in public.  It is not an inconvenience.  It is not a suppression of your freedom.  It actually is a vehicle to achieve our goals.  It adds to your convenience and your freedom because it allows us to open up more places and it allows us places to stay open.  When you do not wear your face covering, we end up in a situation where you see higher rates of disease spread and you end up having to close places.  This mask, this face covering, actually is an instrument of freedom for Americans if we all use it.
Young people, I just want to close by asking you to work with us, please.  Work with us because I know that many of you feel like you’re not at risk or you’re not as high of a risk, but we need all of you to help protect the most vulnerable, but also to protect yourselves and to give you more options.
If you want the return of college football this year, wear a face covering.  If you want a chance at prom next spring, wear a face covering.  I had a interview earlier with a North Carolina radio station; if you want to see North Carolina beat Duke in person this year, wear a face covering.  And I grew up in Maryland and in Indiana, so sorry, Duke, but I — as long as somebody beats you, I’m okay with that.  (Laughter.)  If you want to go on spring break next March, next April, wear a face covering.
I want you all to understand that this is not meant to be pessimistic.  I am actually confident, based on the data we’ve seen around the country and around the world, that if we do the right things, we actually can reopen and stay open.
COVID time is a long time.  In just a few weeks, we can drastically see things go in the wrong direction, but we also can drastically see things improve.  If you all will commit to wearing these face coverings and taking basic public health precautions, as the nation’s doctor, as America’s doctor, I want you to know I have every confidence that we can very quickly see these new case counts go down, and we can reopen, we can get back to school, to work, to worship, and to college football.
But we’ve all got to do our part.  It’s up to you, America.  If you join in and we all do our part, we all win.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Adams.  Thank you so much.  We’ve got time for a few questions.
Great.  Mario.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-rockville-mdxz/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  The front page of the New York Times is not the venue for discussing classified information.  The White House podium is not the venue for discussing classified information.  We are here today, having this discussion, because of an irresponsible, anonymous leak to the New York Times.  There is no good scenario as a result of this New York Times report.
Who’s going to want to cooperate with the United States intelligence community, who’s going to want to be a source or an asset, if they know that their identity could be disclosed?  Which allies will want to share information with us if they know that some rogue intelligence officer can go splash that information on the front page of a major U.S. newspaper?
Specifically, there are two bad scenarios that emerge from this report: Number one, this report makes it more difficult to come to a consensus on this matter, to verify intelligence.  And number two, this level of controversy and discord plays directly into the hands of Russia and, unfortunately, serves their interests.
Since before President Trump assumed office, damaging and oftentimes erroneous leaks seeking to undermine or delegitimize the duly elected president have been published.  According to the DOJ, classified leaks surged in this administration.  There were, under President Obama, just 39, on average, criminal leak referrals.  In this administration, we’ve seen 100 criminal leak referrals to the DOJ in 2017, 88 in 2018, and 104 on average per year.
We have seen targeted leaks of classified information against this President, and it is irresponsible: phone calls with foreign leaders, meetings with government officials, and now reports of alleged intelligence.  Make no mistake: This damages our ability, as a nation, to collect intelligence.
As the National Security Council noted just yesterday, “To those government officials who betray the trust of the people of the United States by leaking classified information, your actions endanger our national security.”
The ODNI said, “The selective leaking of any classified information disrupts the vital interagency work to collect, assess, and mitigate threats, and places our forces at risk.  It is also, simply put, a crime.”
And finally, the CIA said this: that “Leaks compromise and disrupt the critical interagency work to collect, assess, and ascribe culpability.”
To the anonymous sources who leak classified information, you should know this: You may seek to undermine our President, but in fact, you undermine our country’s safety and our country’s security.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Law and order are the building blocks to the American Dream, but if anarchy prevails, this dream comes crum- — comes crumbling down.  Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable, and anger is not enough.  You have a President committed to action.
The DOJ has arrested over 100 anarchists for rioting and destruction of federal property.  The DOJ has also charged four men in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  The FBI has over 200 open domestic terrorism investigations ongoing.  AG Barr has created a task force on violent anti-government extremists led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Northern Texas.
With 200 Trump-appointed judges confirmed, the rule of law will be upheld.  Democrats at all lev- — at all levels — federal, state, and local — have done nothing.  Senate Democrats blocked bipartisan police reform.  Minnesota’s Democrat governor failed to urgently deploy the National Guard — it took President Trump for that to eventually happen; his suggestion — and the ultimate descendance into chaos there in Minneapolis.
Three Democrat Minneapolis councilmembers voted to abolish the police, while they themselves were getting a private security detail.  That’s quite rich.
Democrat mayor of Seattle called the CHOP zone — the autonomous zone — “the summer of love.”  It is anything but that with one dead, multiple shootings, and desperate pleas for help unanswered by business owners and others.
Eleven people were shot in 12 hours this weekend in the Democrat-run New York City.  And 61 people were shot in Democrat-run Chicago, and 15 fatally killed — a Democrat state, a Democrat city.
President Trump stands against defunding our brave police officers, caving to mob rule, and cancel culture which seeks to erase our history.
Let’s be clear: The rampant destruction of statues is not a part of any ideology, but this anarchy is aided by failed Democrat leadership.  And as President Trump has tweeted, these statues, quote, “are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage, both the good and the bad.  It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and to learn from them.”
So let’s stand for law and order, for peace in our streets, and against anarchy.  This is President Trump’s vision for the future.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

1:28 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This past Father’s Day weekend, we saw violence across the country, but we saw scant media coverage of this violence.
Let’s be clear here: The states are responsible for policing their streets.  The governors, the mayors are responsible for ensuring that our streets are safe, that the American people are protected.  And what we have seen is, in far too many Democrat-runs states and Democrat-run cities, we have seen violence and chaos and nothing like the law and order that we saw here in D.C. when President Trump stepped in and surged the National Guard.
In Chicago, for instance, we saw over 100 people were shot and 14 tragically killed, including a three-year-old was among the victims.  And one local news outlet tragically reported that multiple teenagers were killed in Chicago this weekend as well.
In Minneapolis, 11 people were shot and one person killed.  One individual was a father of two who worked as a barber and our hearts break for this family.
Also in Democrat-run New York City, we saw that the New York Post reported that there was one shooting per hour this Saturday — absolutely inexcusable — with 24 people shot on Saturday alone.
And then in Democrat-run Seattle, we’ve seen the autonomous zone, otherwise known as “CHOP” — C-H-O-P.  One person was shot and killed in this autonomous zone run by radical anarchists.  And also, we saw another shooting there yesterday as well.  And the Democrat mayor of the city called CHOP, quote, “the Summer of Love,” but it has been nothing of this sort, clearly, with two individuals shot, one person shot and killed.
It is the responsibility of governors to protect their states, to police their streets.  The police power rests at the state level.  And we expect mayors to step up and to do their job, and governors to step up and do their job in the mold of President Trump, who secured D.C. after a night of lawlessness two weeks ago.
Finally, the Defund Police movement is misguided.  It will only hurt the vulnerable citizens of American cities the most.  It’s sad, and it is shameful.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-062220/

MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon everyone.  The great American comeback is underway.  Just before joining you all, we learned from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that unemployment has fallen in 43 states in May, as Americans are going back to work.
Also, I would like to reemphasize the numbers that Director of the NEC Larry Kudlow shared with you all yesterday that the CBO predicted that, in the third quarter, we will get plus-20 percent GDP.  They’ve predicted in Q4, we will be at plus-20 percent GDP.  And top economist Ed Hyman says that, in Q1 of 2021, he is predicting plus-5 in GDP.  And this would put GDP above its 2019 peak.  That’s right.  So pre-coronavirus numbers, should those predictions pan out.  We are back and we will be booming.
Finally — well, second to finally, we are encouraged that we continue to gather positive data on a number of therapeutics.  Heparin, dexamethasone — or steroids, is as it’s more commonly known; convalescent plasma; and remdesivir have all shown promise in treating coronavirus.  Preliminary findings in a large, UK-based recovery trial found that when steroids were used, there was a 30 percent reduction in death for coronavirus patients on ventilators.  The FDA is reviewing this recovery trial data now.
Additionally, on convalescent plasma, there is more encouraging news.  In partnership with Mayo Clinic, the Trump administration moved very quickly on this therapy in its earliest days, recognizing that it showed promise.  Though the — through the FDA, Mayo Clinic, and the administration’s work and our hand-in-hand partnership, we’ve found that this treatment is very promising.  This has shown that the administration has left no stone unturned in looking at every possible treatment at the very earliest stages.
The lead investigator of this Mayo Clinic study, Dr. Michael Joyner, summed up his work, in saying that convalescent plasma, quote, “continues to look promising,” end quote, noting the, quote, “excellent news” of this study, which covered a diverse population of patients.  About 20 percent were African American, nearly 35 percent Hispanic, 5 percent Asian, and 40 percent women.
Prior experience with respiratory viruses in some data that have emerged globally suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness caused by COVID-19.  The results from Mayo underscore that promise.
As you can see, the Trump administration and FDA lead on identifying convalescent plasma as a therapeutic and the results are encouraging.
Finally, I wanted to share some words from President Trump:  Juneteenth reminds us of both the unimaginable injustice of slavery and the incomparable — incomparable joy that must have attended emancipation.  It is both a remembrance of a blight on our history and a celebration of our nation’s unsurpassed ability to triumph over darkness.  That ability is rooted in the fundamental goodness of America, in the truths upon which we, as a nation, declared an end to our status as the subjects of a monarch and emerged as a free and independent people — those truths that all men are created equal by the hand of God, endowed by our Creator with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.

1:15 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Great to join you today.  So, five years ago today, nine innocent parishioners of a historically black church were killed during an evening Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina.  We all remember that tragedy, and this was a despicable act of evil that happened five years ago today.  So we remember that somber day at that Charleston church, as our hearts still break for the victims and our prayers go out to the families.
Yesterday, President Trump led and brought our nation together behind real, meaningful, substantial change to ensure that we have safe streets and safe policing.  Part of that was having an incentive structure to implement the highest professional standards in our police departments through an accreditation process.
This accreditation entails making sure you have de-escalation practices in place, use of force tactics in place.  Part of that is prohibiting chokehold, except in the event where lethal force is used.  It also incentivizes information sharing and makes sure that if they have an officer who’s had multiple uses of excessive force, that that information is sent to a national database.
And then, finally, another prong of this was having co-responders, who are experts in mental health, going alongside law enforcement, because we know law enforcement officials often have to deal with mental health, homelessness, and addiction.  And having a co-responder, who is an expert in this process, will go a long way.
This is project — progress.  It’s tangible action.  And it’s solutions.
And today, Senator Tim Scott said this is “not a binary choice” between supporting police officers and between supporting victims of grave injustices, like George Floyd.  It’s not a binary choice.  There are not sides here.  This is about America coming together.  This is about human decency.  And this is about justice.  And when we see injustices, we recognize them.
As President Trump said yesterday, all children deserve equal opportunity because we are all made equal by God.  That is so true.
First, let me point out that I have sat across from a police officer family that lost their loved one.  I saw a little girl named Charlie, who will forever grow up without a father; who will forever grow up without a father for prom, for the father-daughter dance.  And it was heartbreaking to know that she lost her father, who was a valiant hero.
But yesterday, I sat across from families who lost their loved ones in mass instances of injustice.  And it was heartbreaking to hear their stories.  It was a real tragedy.  It was a tearful moment.  It was an emotional moment.  And it’s one that the President, when I asked him in the Oval Office about it afterwards, he said this: “I love those families.  I want to help those families.”  And President Trump means that.  Because this is about humanity.  That is ultimately what this is about.
And Senator Scott shared a very beautiful Bible verse with those families yesterday, and I just want to read it here, to close.  Romans 8:28: “And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to his purpose.”  He shared that Bible verse with those families, and it was particularly meaningful to me and, I think, to the families, as well.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-061720/

2:48 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, I’m sorry we are very late, you guys.  I’m sorry to keep you waiting.  I was working with the President on something, and he wanted me to hand this out to you all.  And I have it here, so I want to read it to the American public, directly from the President:
“It has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our legendary military bases, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina; Fort Hood in Texas; Fort Benning in Georgia.”  And the list goes on.  “These monumental and very powerful bases have become part of a great American heritage and a history of winning, victory, and freedom.  The United States of America trained and deployed our heroes [here]…and won two world wars.  Therefore, my administration will not even consider the renaming of these magnificent and fabled military installations.  Our history, as the greatest nation in the world, will not be tampered with.  Respect our military!”
So that was directly from the President.  And we spent some time working on that, and I wanted to deliver that to you.
Also, I wanted to take us through a few other things relating to the coronavirus.  First, the coronavirus task force briefing was held yesterday.  I was in it, and there was some very good news that I’d like to share with you.  I don’t know if you all saw; there were two studies that came out — very strong studies — in the journal, Nature.  And in Europe, which had a very similar epidemic profile to the United States, 3.1 million lives were saved due to mitigation and the efforts taken by the European governments.  And as Dr. Birx noted to me — she sent this to me just before I walked out here — she said it suggests that the United States also prevented over 3 million deaths, thanks to the efforts of President Trump and the American people.
Another study found that the shutdown efforts prevented 50 million additional coronavirus cases.  So those are two very encouraging studies underscoring the work of the American people.
Also, the Washington Post noted that these two reports use completely different methods to reach similar conclusions.  They suggest that the aggressive and unprecedented shutdowns were effective at halting the exponential spread of the novel coronavirus.  So thank you, Washington Post, for that good reporting.
The Department of Agriculture, Secretary Sonny Perdue also had some very good news in the task force briefing I was at yesterday.  America’s meatpacking facilities — at one time, it looked like they were going to need to close; that was unacceptable to the administration.  So we took action — the coronavirus task force took action — and now I’m pleased to report that these meatpacking facilities are operating at 95 percent capacity compared to 2019.  We have beef operating at 98 percent capacity, pork at 95 percent, and poultry at 98 percent.
Throughout America’s extraordinary efforts to slow the spread, President Trump ensured that the meat supply chain stayed functional and robust by directing these meatpacking facilities to safely operate in accordance with the CDC and OSHA guidelines.  His efforts secured America’s continual access to a steady food supply chain.
And then, finally, and very importantly, I have some great data points to share on coronavirus testing capacity and minority communities.  Admiral Brett Giroir shared this with me yesterday and last night as well: He said that when we look at testing sites, President Trump’s public-private partnership with retail companies has proven quite successful.  Testing sites are operating in 49 states with 70 percent of these sites located in communities with moderate to high social vulnerabilities.  And social vulnerability takes into account race, ethnicity, housing and economics, language barriers, and other factors.
Also, federally qualified health centers — they’re FQHCs — serve 29 million patients in 12,000 communities across the nation.  They provide care to one in five of those uninsured, one in five rural Americans, one in five of — one in three of individuals below the poverty line, and more than 1.3 million homeless men and women, and nearly a million migrant agricultural workers.  And 92 percent of these FQHCs now offer COVID test.  And we’ve awarded them $583 million to 1,385 of these facilities.
And finally, finally — I promise my last announcement:  The HHS Office of Minority Health issued a competitive funding opportunity to build a strategic network of national, state, territory, tribal, local, and community-based organizations that deliver vital health information and support linkages to services for racial and ethnic minorities.  And this — this announcement — this network is scheduled to be awarded at the end of June and is expected to reach at least 40 million individuals from racial and ethnic minorities.
These updates, I was told by Brett Giroir, were received very well at the Senate hearings.  And we thank the Vice President, Mike Pence, for doing an amazing job leading our coronavirus task force, and to President Trump, who has led in bringing America through the coronavirus pandemic.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-061020/

2:13 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello everyone.  The transition to greatness has officially begun.  Friday’s jobs report was encouraging, to say the absolute least.  The jobs in this country — we had more than 2.5 million added.  The prediction was that 7.5 million jobs would be lost.  This was a 10 million swing toward the positive side and, in fact, the greatest number of jobs created in a single month on record.  That is extraordinary.  225,000 manufacturing jobs, 464,000 thousand construction jobs, and 1.2 million leisure and hospitality jobs were all added in May.
Beyond that, the number of workers who reported being on temporary layoffs decreased by 2.7 million in May.  And more than that — and this was a great number that was pointed out to me today by the CEA — 300- — 300,000 jobs were created for black Americans in particular.  That’s in May, and that was a 1.7 percent increase.  So very encouraging numbers there from the CEA that they highlighted for me — BLS numbers that they highlighted.
May’s jump in average weekly hours also was an encouraging sign because increasing hours is a sign that employees need to hire — employers need to hire more workers to meet demand.  For all private-sector employees, average weekly hours increased by 0.5 percent to 34.7 hours — the highest level since the series began in 2006.  Seventy-three percent of small businesses are open.  That is up from the 52 percent right before the April jobs report reference period.  Also, workplace visits are up roughly 40 percent from its pandemic low.
The stock market is absolutely soaring.  We saw with the S&P that it had its greatest 50-day rally in history.  The Dow, likewise, is also booming.  The markets clearly have confidence in President Trump — the jobs President who created the hottest economy in modern history once and will do it again.
Also commentators and economists have noted how great this jobs report was.  Yesterday, we saw Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, say this will go down in history as the biggest positive data shock for the markets and the economy.  And you saw how surprised the markets were.  They surged on Friday, capping a strong week, with the NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060820/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  So I’m going to start with a few housekeeping announcements.  First of all, the President’s annual physical results are ready for release.  The full memo will be released shortly.  But in summary, the President remains healthy.
Also, I’d like to congratulate the winners of last night’s primary elections.  President Trump has now endorsed candidates and has a 64 to 0 record in congressional, special, and primary election races since the midterms, demonstrating the strength of and support for the President’s agenda across the country as evidenced in the 64 consecutive congressional, special, and primary elections over the past 13 months.
So, next, I want to transition to talking about some of the things going on around the country.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to riot.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to loot.  The First Amendment doesn’t give anyone the right to burn down buildings.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to deface property.  And it does not give anyone the right to assault private citizens and to assault police officers.
The First Amendment, however, does give you the right to peaceably assemble.  And the greatest example that we have seen of peaceful protest, an absolute embodiment of the First Amendment, is the March on Washington.  On August 28, 1963, a quarter of a million Americans gathered at the Lincoln Memorial and peacefully made a powerful march and a powerful point: that all Americans should be treated equally; that racial discrimination was unacceptable, abhorrent, and that it needed to be rectified.
And in the famous “I Have a Dream” speech by Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, he said this: “We must not allow our creative protest to de”- — excuse me, “to degenerate into physical violence.  Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.”
And soul force is exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. met the nation with when he said this: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”  Important words, important actions from an American hero who contributed to making this nation the greatest on Earth.
With that in mind, we must remember to recognize the lives lost, the passing of George Floyd who was killed unjustly — in a horrific video that we all have seen.  And we must also remember the passing of police captain David Dorn yesterday, who was shot and killed by looters in St. Louis, in an absolute tragedy.  A retired officer, 77 years old, whose wife was also a police officer herself.  Dorn was a hero and an unfortunate casualty in the riots we have seen.  Our hearts are with his family.
We are all Americans.  We must come together.  We must unify.  And we must have law and order.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Weijia.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060320/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  The President has made clear that what we are seeing on America’s streets is unacceptable.  Violence, looting, anarchy, lawlessness are not to be tolerated, plain and simple.  These criminal acts are not protest.  They are not statements.  These are crimes that harm innocent American citizens.
The First Amendment guarantees the right of the people to peaceably assemble.  What we saw last night in Washington and across the country was not that.
To that end, President Trump is demanding action to protect American citizens, to protect American businesses.  Seventeen thousand National Guard are deployed in 24 states, but according to General Milley, only two states have deployed more than 1,000.  There are 350,000 National Guard available overall, and for the lawlessness we are seeing, far more needs to be done.
Governors across the country must act, deploy the National Guard as it’s fit, and protect American communities.  As President Trump has said repeatedly, it’s very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights of peaceful protesters, but we cannot allow a situation like what happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060120/

2:14 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, I want to start by acknowledging the horrific tragedy in Minnesota of George Floyd.  The death of George Floyd is absolutely tragic — that video that we saw, that I saw, that my staff saw, that the President saw.
And the President put out a statement last night that, “At [his] request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd.  I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by law enforcement.  My heart goes out to George’s family and friends.  Justice will be served!”
I can tell you that as I’m briefing you at this moment, the President is receiving a briefing from the Attorney General, Bill Barr, on this and the Deputy Director of the FBI, as that is ongoing on as I began this briefing.
Secondly, I want to transition into some news from SBA and Treasury that was announced, that today, the U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, announced that it is setting aside $10 billion of round two funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to be lent exclusively to CDFIs.  Those are community development financial institutions.  CDFIs work to expand economic opportunity in low-income communities by providing access to financial products and services for local residents and businesses.  So we’re encouraged to see that.
And then, finally, before taking your questions, I wanted to address what has been going on on Twitter and with social media.  I believe it is time to, quote, “get the facts” about Twitter and other social media platforms targeting their bias against President Trump and conservatives online.
If we were to judge the bias of Twitter and its top employees by their own words, the case would be an easy one to make.  Twitter’s head of site integrity has tweeted that there are, quote, “actual Nazis” in the White House, and no fact-check label was ever applied to this absolutely outrageous, offensive, and false claim made against the White House and its employees.
But let’s judge Twitter based on their actions, not based on the words of its top employees.  And its actions are no better.  President Trump recently received a so-called “fact check” label for a tweet.  It was a false fact check, an inaccurate fact check, but nevertheless, Twitter moved forward with it.
Dan Scavino, the Deputy Chief of Staff here, was the first user in the history of Twitter to receive a so-called, quote, “manipulated media” label for posting a video that played a verbatim clip.  It is no coincidence that these two unbelievable interventions by Twitter were targeted against the President of the United States and one of the President’s top advisors.  This is bias in action.
And while big tech is quick to censor the President, quick to censor some of his top employees, they — they are very reluctant, it seems, to label some of the actions by Chinese officials, some of the misinformation that has been spread by China.  For example, to move off of Twitter and move to Google, they created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party, which blacklisted searches for human rights and allowed for easy surveillance.
Facebook and Twitter have both taken paid advertising that spread disinformation about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities.  And Twitter has allowed Chinese officials to use its platforms to spread misinformation about the coronavirus, undermine the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and more.
And then, back in March, a Chinese official began spreading a conspiracy theory on Twitter — an egregious one — that our U.S. military was responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.  And that tweet, that disinformation, it took all the way until today, when we raised concerns about it, to get a fact check.
So they appear to be very hastily eager to censor President Trump and some of his employees but a little reluctant when it comes to China.  It’s a bit befuddling.
But no one believes in the First Amendment more than the President.  The President will take action to ensure that big tech does not stifle free speech and that the rights of all Americans to speak, tweet, and post are protected.
And finally, I just want to note one other action of Twitter that I learned just before walking out here: that, on the Mueller report, their anti-Trump headlines were anti-Trump by a ratio of 76 to 1.  That’s extraordinary.  And it’s not just bias aimed at President Trump and his employees, it’s also aimed at everyday Americans.  It’s aimed at the movie “Unplanned,” as Twitter suspended their account and then came up with an excuse in the aftermath.
And then, just another example that liberals are allowed to incite violence against the Covington kids who were, in the end, proven right and their video was taken out of context, and yet these individuals were led — were allowed by Twitter to incite violence.  It’s very disturbing to see.
So those are some of the President’s concerns.  And with that, I will take questions.
Jim.  That’s a very nice tie, Jim, by the way.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052820/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  I hope you all had an enjoyable weekend.  I have some brief announcements for you today — just that now we have 760 sites and retail locations in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia.  CVS is planning to open an additional 650 sites.  These are encouraging numbers.  It’s, again, a testament to our private sector for all that they’ve done in partnering with the administration and helping to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Also skilled nursing facilities — there was an announcement that I just want to underscore that $4.9 billion in additional relief funds were distributed to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities, and these funds are provided under the CARES Act.
So just those two items for you this morning, and we’ll go ahead and we’ll start with questions.

1:48 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith.  I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they’ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time.
Today, I’m identifying houses of worship — churches, synagogue, and mosques — as essential places that provide essential services.
Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship.  It’s not right.  So I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.
I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now.  If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call.
These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united.  The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque.  Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life.
The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams, and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray.  I know them well.  They love their congregations.  They love their people.  They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else.
The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend.  If they don’t do it, I will override the governors.  In America, we need more prayer, not less.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
MS. MCENANY:  All right, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to join you today.  That was a great announcement from President Trump.  I’d like to introduce Dr. Birx right now.  She has a wonderful presentation pursuant to reopening America, and some great data to share with you.
So I’ll let her kick this off.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  If we can have the first slide, please.
I wanted to start out with a summary of the number of Americans we have lost to date.  But the exciting thing for all of us is the decreasing mortality over time, and I think it both is a real aspect of the amazing healthcare workers on the frontline, the ability of people to share at the frontline how best to care for the patients and the continuous decrease in mortality over time.
Next slide.
The other thing that has decreased significantly over the last month is new hospitalizations.  We can see now that there’s over a 50 percent decline in new hospitalizations.  Although every region of the country is different, we are encouraged to see these new hospitalizations declining.
Next slide.
I’ve talked before about the extensive surveillance that CDC has made available to this country.  This is looking at their syndromic surveillance from emergency rooms.  You can see that both COVID-like illnesses shown in the orange, and shown in the blue, influenza-like illness — taking up both of those cases together — you can see significant declines week over week of number of people coming to the emergency room with these illnesses.  That goes along with our new hospitalizations.
What we like to do is triangulate data, put data together from multiple sources, to see if we’re seeing the same trends so that we can ensure that we’re making progress together.
Next slide.
This is their influenza-like illness surveillance system that has been up and running for more than a decade now.  You can see each of the influenza peaks of this last year.  I think that’s very important to remind people of because we had influenza A, influenza B, and then we had COVID-like illness.  And while we know it’s COVID — that’s the last orange peak — what we really find encouraging is, across the country, we are below baseline.  Why is that particularly important?  Now, these are reported state by state, county by county.  So each county will be able to see precisely where they are.  And then if there is changes in this, it becomes yet again an early alert system.
So I’ve showed you two early alert systems: one of them emergency rooms visits based on our syndromic illness qualifications that the CDC has up on their website, and then the influenza-like illness.  And again, to the American people, all of these are available on the CDC website under “COVID-19 Cases and Surveillance.”
Next slide.
Now, I want to show you — I’m going to go through these very quickly.  This is where we started; this is influenza-like illness, the red.  And the darker the red, the more significant the influenza-like illness is in that state.  So you want to get to green.
So this is the week ending March 28th.  I think many of us can remember what that week was, and this was when we were at the very beginning of our acceleration into logarithmic phase.
Next slide.
This is April 4th.  You’re starting to see some of the states already turn green.
Next slide.  April 11th, more of the country.  Next slide.  April 18th.  Next slide.  April 25th.
Next slide.  May 2nd.  And you can see — and I really call your attention to — there’s a orange area on this slide, and you can see that it’s the Maryland area, and we’ve been calling that out for a while, the high plateau in Maryland.  You can also see Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Next slide.
And then you can see Wisconsin still.  You can see Maryland is yellow.
Next slide.
And I want to turn just a moment, and I know that took you through a lot of slides quickly, but I think we can see, as a country, we have decreasing amount of illness, both at the emergency room and reported through the influenza-like illness.  Two of the surveillance systems at the CDC has up and running.  These come from the states; they come from the counties.  And many of the states have these also on their websites.
We talked earlier about how we had prioritized testing to the area that had the most significant disease.  And you can see now Rhode Island has led all of the states.  It’s almost up to testing 12 percent of all of their citizens.  It’s followed by New York, and you can’t see New York, but that’s the very next one.  New York and then North Dakota.  And so you can see that.  Well, you could.
Yeah, you could see that most of the high-burden areas of the United States had more than 6 percent testing.  That’s when I think you heard from Admiral Giroir we wanted every state to test at least 2 percent of their population during May.  You can see 100 percent of the states now are over 2 percent of their population.  And we’ll fix this slide so you can see every state, but many of the states now are over 4 percent.  And this is just after getting all the materials to ensure that they have adequate transport media and swabs.
So we’re encouraged by the progress that many of the governors and states have made in their testing of their population.  It is also why we took the opportunity to really encourage governors, and it was to encourage governors to test 100 percent of the nursing home residents and staff, because many of our outbreaks that we have seen over the last two months have started in nursing homes.
Next slide.
Now, this is a complicated slide, but this is trying to show you how we triangulate data.  So I took you through our surveillance systems.  I’m taking you now into the start of how we use laboratory data to really understand what’s happening, both in the metros and at the state level.
This is every single state.  And you can see the triangles — the top part that you can see, the little triangle-ly pieces or the diamonds — that is where the states were in the number of positive tests.  This is the nucleic acid test.  This is diagnosing virus in your nose.  You can see where it was 30 days ago and where it is now, by the red squares.
You can see a dramatic decline across the states.  And indeed, New York City, just six weeks ago, was almost 40 percent.  It is now, for the first time, as a New York — as a New York State, under 10 percent.
And so this is the progress that we’re making in both expanding testing, finding more people, but ensuring that we’re getting testing rates of about 10 percent.  This line is 10 percent.  So 42 states are — now have less than 10 percent test positive on a rolling seven-day average.
Now, again, I’m going to call your attention to the top three states — the top three states with the largest percent.  And this is so you can all make your decisions about going outside and social distancing, potentially playing golf, if you’re very careful and you don’t touch the flags and all of those issues; playing tennis with marked balls with just one other person so you’re only touching your ball.  We found, really, people who enjoy sports have been able to really adjust to social distancing.
But you can see the top three states are Maryland, the District, and Virginia.  And so there is still significant virus circulating here.  That is followed by Nebraska, Illinois — because of Chicago — and what we’ve talked about before about Minnesota.  So those are our top states as far as still having high number of test positives.
When I say high number of test positives, they’re all under 20 percent.  If I had shown you this slide four weeks ago, half of the country would have been over 20 percent.  So this also shows progress, but also very clearly about the region we’re living in right now with disease.
Next slide.
Now, I wanted you to see this as a metro, because that’s as a state level.  So we look at this in multiple different ways.  The number one metro with the highest positivity rate is the District of Columbia, which includes Northern Virginia and Maryland — Montgomery County and PG County.  That is followed by Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis.  And so these are the places where we have seen really a stalling or an increase of cases, as in Minneapolis.
You can see all the other metros — all the other metros are almost all exclusively below 10 percent.  So we see this as great progress across the board in the metro areas.
Next slide.
So we also look at daily cases and daily case numbers.  And I know that you all know that that’s a very erratic — and it depends sometimes on how the tests were reported, how the cases were reported, and so you often have to look at it over a three- or seven-day period.  This is looking at daily cases on a seven-day rolling average.  You can see the number one — the top peak that has now come down dramatically — is the New York metro area.
Underneath that, you can see our concerns about Chicago and our concern in the yellow line of the Washington, D.C. area, because these are two areas that went through the logarithmic  phase and are now at a high plateau with an unchanging number of cases day over day.  That’s the orange line and the yellow line.
You can see that the daily case numbers, per hundred thousand, are below the yellow line and the orange line of Washington, D.C. and Chicago.  And that’s New York, Boston, and many of the others.  Providence is also up as a per hundred thousand.  And that’s the way we like to look at it, because we can really then understand it in relationship to population.
The other groups that have very low levels that once had a peak — this is Detroit, a very low level now.  This is Boston in the gray, which has come way down also.  And you can see down here is Atlanta and Miami.
Next slide.
Now, sometimes, and I think recently, there have been publications about where the world was before we started the Stop the Spread and before many states shut down.  And to just to take you back to that moment: On March 14th, before Stop the Spread, this is showing New York.  I didn’t even put March 14th on there because New York, on March 14th, had less than 50 cases reported.  Chicago had less than 10.  Washington had less than 10.  LA had less than 20.  The large state, at that time, that had a significant number of cases was the Washington area — Washington State, which had 100 cases.
On March 14th, we had about 500 cases distributed around the United States, not in any dramatic hotspot per se, but the majority of those cases and the hotspot at that moment was Washington State.  This is how the New York metro area, which includes obviously northern New Jersey, northern parts of Pennsylvania, parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and the dramatic decline that they’ve had in the number of cases.  And I know you know that also mortality has started to decrease in that northern New Jersey and New York area.
Next slide.
But I wanted you to see how we bring all this information together on a daily basis.  The red line in this graphic are the emergency room visits.  So those are the syndromic visits that I discussed with you at the beginning.  The blue line is the test positive.  And again, it’s very erratic because of the reporting of when cases sometimes from the entire weekend are added on a Monday morning.  And then you can see the actual case numbers in the black bars.
And so that’s how we bring everything together.  And what we want to see is all of the — all of the items trending down.  We want to see the number of positives that you find, because we really have states now looking for asymptomatic cases.  So we want to ensure that both asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases are all declining as shown in the blue line; that emergency room visits are declining; and the actual case numbers are declining together.  And of course, then there’s mortality behind that in the green lines that are — green bars that are hard for you to see.
Next slide.
But this is the Washington area.  And so that’s why I wanted you to see that contrast.  You can see there’s not been that dramatic decline in the blue line.  There’s not been that dramatic decline in the black bars of cases.  And there’s not been a dramatic decline in the emergency room visits with COVID-like illnesses.
So even though Washington has remained closed, LA has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases.  And I’ve asked the CDC, and the CDC is working with the local areas in Chicago, in this area, and LA to really understand where are these new cases coming from and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.
Next slide.
This is Chicago.  Again, just to show you going up into this high plateau that has been fairly persistent.
Next slide.
And this is Los Angeles.  So you can get a flavor of where we have concerns, of where cities have remained closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent high number of cases.
Next slide.
So then I wanted to talk to you about outbreaks, because throughout this all, there’s been a large part of America that has been — and many states — that have been really finding their outbreaks, containing those outbreaks by testing everyone, and doing contact tracing, and then stopping them and stopping those outbreaks in their tracks, what we have been talking about everybody being able to do across the United States.
And so this illustrates the counties that have had 100 percent increase in new cases over the last few days — over the last three days.
Now, the reason I wanted to show this is because I see more and more graphics out there that talk about cases going up versus cases going down.
Just to give you an example of Wyoming — and I think many of the groups now have Wyoming as a red state of cases going up.  Wyoming, three days ago, had five cases confirmed and today had — yesterday had nine.  So they qualify, almost, and show up as this large increase.  We — it’s a good alert for us.  We immediately look and look and see what exactly is happening at the state website.
But you can see, when you have very low number of cases, you can have a doubling from 5 to 10 number of cases and show up as 100 percent increase.  And so each of these have to be investigated separately to really understand what this is.  It is the way we find outbreaks in prisons.  It’s the way we have been finding outbreaks in nursing homes.  And we have this graphic.  It goes through all of the counties as well as — next slide.
So this is one state’s analysis.  And what they have shown — and they have been able to find each of their outbreaks, contain every one of their outbreaks, close those outbreaks, and call them closed cases.
In this case, the dark blue is community spread.  The rest of it, 50 percent of their cases, have been coming from outbreaks that they’ve been able to contain.
The largest group in this is meatpacking plants.  And what they’ve been doing is going in and testing 100 percent of the individuals in the meatpacking plant, and also finding 100 percent of the individuals that are associated with those individuals in the meatpacking plant.  They’ve been able to go into group housing, social gatherings.
So just as we discuss all of this, and when you go out for this weekend, Memorial Day, and you want to do some kind of social gathering, it’s very important to maintain that six-feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance cannot be maintained.
But it also talks about long-term care facilities.  Now, interestingly enough, 50 percent of their total cases, since they’ve been tracking, came from these outbreaks.  Almost 70- plus percent — 76 of all their mortality, though, came from these outbreaks.
And this is why we have been really pushing both in the original Opening up America Again, in the testing blueprint.  We talk about proactive surveillance, proactive monitoring and testing in areas that you know are particularly susceptible to outbreaks.
Every state has this knowledge now and this type of analysis.  And so when they have these kinds of analysis, what we’re asking them to do is proactively go and test everyone in meatpacking plants, to proactively go and test 100 percent of the residents and workers, and then a follow-up of the workers in every single long-term care facility.
And this is to find the asymptomatic cases.  I know CDC yesterday released that they thought 35 percent.  We started with the understanding that we thought it was around 11 to 15 percent, based on the experience with one of the Princesses.  But now we know it’s at least 35.  It may be greater than that because it may be so age dependent that there may be a lot of people under 30 that have the virus and are shedding the virus and aren’t aware that they have the virus.  And so, proactive monitoring, proactive testing will become absolutely critical to find these asymptomatic cases.
Next slide.
So this is my last slide.  And this is just to show you what an outbreak looks like.  So if you look at this axis, it’s normalized through 100,000 population.  But you can see — this is what we want to see.  We want to see very low case number.  We want to see that they’ve identified an outbreak, they tested 100 percent, they’ve contained 100 percent, and then they don’t find any more cases.
And so this is what’s happening across the country, county by county — this is a county map — to really show you the work that’s going on.  And since the last two months, we’ve gone from, I think, less than 4,000 contact tracers to nearly 50,000 contact tracers.  And this is what’s been happening behind the scenes.
But I really want to applaud the governors and state and health and local — the health — the health commissioners and the local health departments who have really been working quietly, in an unassuming way, to really find these cases, track these cases, isolate these cases, and ensure there’s no additional spread.  And you can see, in many of these instances, they’ve gone more than two weeks without any additional spread.
And so this is what we are hoping goes across the United States.  Now, we all have to admit, it’s going to be much more difficult in metro areas because you have to really identify where are those asymptomatic cases and how will you find them.  And it’s why there’s been a lot of additional resources go in — going into disadvantaged areas, into the federal community clinics to be able to proactively be able to test for this virus and find asymptomatic individuals.
When someone gets sick with COVID — excuse me — when someone gets sick with COVID, you’ve — you’ve heard the cases; some of them have very high fevers, and so they’re not out walking around.  So they may have been shedding virus for one or two days before they got significantly ill and they had to be in bed because they felt so terrible.
Now, think of that.  They were maybe out two days.  And so if they’re 50 percent of the cases, they’re only out for two of the days that they may be spreading virus.  An asymptomatic individual that doesn’t know they have COVID, they may be spreading and shedding the entire time that they’re in the community.  So instead of two days, it may be six days or it may be seven days.
And so when we talk about proportions, 35 percent that are asymptomatic, that are out in the community, is very — is much more opportunity for transmission than someone who is getting sick and is only out in the community for two days.  And so we know we have to find both, and we’ve been working with states about what proactive surveillance would look like in this case to find people who are asymptomatic.
But it’s also why we continue to recommend to the public, very clearly, that you can’t tell who’s infected.  And so that’s why you have to continue to social distance, that why — that’s why you need to continue to maintain six feet apart.
I remember in the early days of HIV, people told me all the time that they could — they knew who was infected.  And I would say, “You don’t know who’s infected.  I could be infected.  You’re just saying you don’t think I’m infected because I look healthy.”  There’s a lot of healthy people out there with COVID that look healthy.
And so we’re asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend, to play golf, to hike, as Dr. Fauci said, to play tennis with marked balls, and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with, and to even consider sharing social distance space, as long as you have utensils that are — belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately.  There’s a lot of things to think through.  I know you can do this.  I know the American people can do it.
And so, please, as you go out this weekend, understand you can go out.  You can be outside.  You can play golf.  You can play tennis with marked balls.  You can go to the beaches if you stay six feet apart.  But remember that that is your space, and that’s the space that you need to protect and ensure that your social distanced from others.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052220/

3:35 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to begin by detailing the historic private-public partnership effort launched by the Trump administration to combat the coronavirus.  As both a businessman and as President, you’ll all remember then-candidate Donald Trump, now President Donald Trump, being adamant about bringing manufacturing jobs back to America.
President Obama and the Democrats had given up on manufacturing with President Obama’s erroneously prediction that Trump would need a magic wand in order to bring back American jobs.  Not so.
The reality is President Trump revived manufacturing in this country, and he tore up disastrous trade deals that hemorrhaged American jobs, like NAFTA and like the plan that was in work, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Instead, he put in place better trade deals to bring back American jobs and to bring back American manufacturing.
And in the battle against the invisible enemy, President Trump took action to shore up our domestic supply chains in order to deliver the necessary PPE and other medical equipment to the states.
Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are currently promoting a 3-trillion-dollar liberal wish list, among a litany of Democrat priorities immaterial to the coronavirus crisis, are embedded in this, and one would require the President to appoint a, quote, “medical supplies response coordinator” who would, quote, “serve as the point of contact for the healthcare system, supply chain officials, and the states on medical supplies.”
I’m happy to report this individual already exists.  This bill ignores reality, because the medical supplies official is in existence; he’s been working on this since March to deliver, to date, over billions and billions — more than 1 billion, I should say, pieces of PPE to countries and hospitals across the country.
Since March 29th, Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, Vice Director for Logistics for the Joint Chiefs, has been on the job as the head of FEMA’s Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force.  This is a historic partnership with the private sector, and under the leadership of President Trump, FEMA directed the greatest mobilization of the private sector since World War Two.
Rear Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA quickly realized the power of the private sector in addressing the coronavirus, recognizing that the six largest private sector medical distributors would have the ability to source, procure, manufacture, and deliver as many as 1 billion pieces of PPE in a single week.  That is an extraordinary volume by our private sector.  And at the direction of President Trump, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA were able to harness this power.
Every day at 9:00 a.m., Rear Admiral Polowczyk’s team huddles with these six large private sector medical distributors and, together, they review data compiled by Dr. Birx, as well as information provided by the CDC, to set priorities and ensure sufficient levels of supplies go down not just to the county level but to the hospital level.
After focusing geographically, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and his team orients the data to set point-of-care distribution priorities for public hospitals, VA and DOD facilities, private hospitals, nursing homes, acute cli- — excuse me, acute care clinics, first responders, and labs.
In just two and a half weeks, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and his team were able to combine data streams, utilize supply chain visualization tools from DOD, and input data into the cloud.  This system is now available to generate reports for governors showing what their state received from the federal government and commercial partners all the way down to the hospital level, as I noted.
And thanks to President Trump and his administration, governors now have visibility as to where their supplies are sent and where they’re received.  And from March 1st through May 10th, this public-private partnership has led to the delivery — and these are extraordinary numbers — of over 113 million N95 respirator masks, nearly half a billion surgical masks, nearly 18 million face shields, and over 12 billion gloves.  That is a lot of PPE, and we thank our private sector partners for engaging in this effort with us.
Also, I just wanted to note that, earlier today, the President held an hour-long call with thousands of Hispanic community, business, and faith leaders across the country.  He recognized the many contributions of the Hispanic community to our country and addressed important issues, like how to reopen their businesses and build the greatest economy in history again.
And finally, before I take questions, I just wanted to note on a separate note that I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Ravi Zacharias, a renowned Christian apologist who left this world yesterday.  Our prayers are with Ravi’s family during this time.  He meant a lot to a lot of people around this administration.  And as my father said, Billy Graham was the great evangelist and Ravi Zacharias was the great apologist.  And we are all thinking about him and holding him close to our hearts and his family today.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052020/

2:40 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Sorry we’re a little late today.  As you know, the President had two events this morning, so we didn’t want our unprecedented transparency to get in the way of lunch, so we’re glad that you all had a few moments there to eat.  So our delay was hopefully useful and helpful to you guys.
I have an announcement on the Trump administration’s unwavering support for our farmers.  Today, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and senior advisor Ivanka Trump announced the launch of the Farmers to Families Food Box program.  This is a $3 billion program to support farmers and provide food to our most vulnerable communities.  Senior advisor Ivanka Trump and Secretary Perdue are doing very good work.
Now I would like to focus on the Trump administration’s unprecedented coronavirus response.  Some have erroneously suggested that the Trump administration threw out the pandemic response playbook left by the Obama-Biden administration.  What the critics fail to note, however, is that this thin packet of paper was replaced by two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.  So we exchanged this one, which I will hand over to my assistant, Lyndee, for these two pandemic response plans.
In 2018, the Trump administration issued our Pandemic Crisis Action Plan, one of the binders that I just handed to Lyndee.  Further, from August 13th to the 16th, the Trump administration conducted the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise.  This was a pandemic stimulation [simulation] to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak.
In January of 2020, HHS issued the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise After-Action Report.  That was one of the additional documents that I just handed over.  This exercise expounded upon — exposed, rather, the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response, beginning as early as January.  And those legacy planning document shortcomings were, in fact, the papers that I just handed over, that were provided to us by the Obama-Biden administration.
For example, President Trump’s Crimson After-Action Report highlighted that the Obama-era policy directive from November 2016, quote — and I’m quoting from the document — “Does not provide the requisite mechanisms or processes to effectively lead the coordination of the federal government’s response.”  Instead, President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force and put Vice President Pence in charge of the interagency response.  These were effective decisions, and they undoubtedly enhanced our response to the coronavirus.
Furthermore, what Crimson Contagion taught us is that President Trump was right all along about misguided economic and trade policies that left Americans vulnerable to pandemics.
In June 2016 — so, many, many years ago — then-businessman Donald Trump said this: quote, “America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer…I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.  Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.  This is not some natural disaster.  It is politician-made disaster.”  That was then-candidate Trump, who has now implemented those policies as President Trump.
And this forward-thinking vision contrasted with that of President Obama who said, quote, “Trump just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’  Well, what — how exactly are you going to negotiate that?  What magic wand do you have?”  That magic wand was ripping up Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It was ripping up NAFTA.  It was replacing it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a great deal for automakers and our farmers.  And it was ending China’s predatory trade policies and negotiating a historic phase one China deal.  That is what this President has done.
Yesterday, President Trump went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and visited Owens & Minor, Inc.  This was a clear example of domestic manufacturing at work.  You saw this administration taking action to restructure and secure our stockpile of medical supplies.  President Trump released a plan to restructure the Strategic National Stockpile yesterday, and he signed an executive order providing the authority to ensure America is producing critical goods necessary to build up our strategic stockpiles.
The President’s trip was an example of what he’s been saying all along: that America must manufacture, that America must produce, here, in our interior.
Additionally, the President launched Project Air Bridge to bring supplies from all over the world to support America’s frontline healthcare workers.  The administration partnered with the private sector to secure donations and production of PPE and other medical supplies.  And President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act, otherwise known as the DPA, to mobilize our country to manufacture and secure massive amounts of PPE and ventilators.
Through Project Air Bridge, to date, more than 1.4 million N95 respirators have been delivered, as well as 90- — 921 million gloves, 17.1 million surgical gowns, and more.
The Trump playbook and the whole-of-America response to this pandemic has far exceeded what this administration inherited.
And finally, President Trump took action before the pandemic to anticipate and game-plan such scenarios.  President Trump streamlined the National Security Council in 2018 by creating a counter-proliferation and bio-defense directorate.  This directorate combined NSC experts focused on biological threats under a single and more senior leader, and did away with a confusing organizational chart that required some experts to report to two bosses simultaneously.
In short, the NSC retained the same number of experts focused on biological threats that the Obama administration had, but honed them in and focused them more and house them in a more coherent structure and with a more senior leader.
I’d also note that this directorate, which exists today, is the same office that critics allege, to this day, that President Trump eliminated.  I hope in your reporting you are now able to debunk this claim.
Recognizing the seriousness of biological threats, President Trump released a series of strategic documents to transform our preparedness for biological incidents, including pandemics.  In September of 2018, President Trump released the National Biodefense Strategy.  In May of 2019, he released the Global Health Security Strategy.  And in September of 2019, he signed an EO to modernize influenza vaccines.
His leadership is evident in the early days of this pandemic and in the preparation before that.  And these actions I’ve outlined today, these plans I noted, helped us as we approached what was an unprecedented crisis.  It helped us to deploy our resources and to deliver what I believe is the one of the best responses we’ve seen in this country’s history.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-051520/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  I want to highlight three critical aspects of President Trump’s response to the coronavirus that have exceeded the media’s expectations and should inspire confidence in every American across this country.  Rest assured the Trump administration is working tirelessly to defeat the invisible enemy.
First, contrary to some media pronouncements, the United States did not need the 1 million ventilators thus far that the media said we were in dire need of.  In fact, it’s encouraging to be able to say that every single American who has needed a ventilator has received a ventilator.  And this administration has managed to pe- — procure, excuse me, 100,000 ventilators to be manufactured in 100 days.  That’s extraordinary.  That’s three times the amount produced in the average year.
Likewise, there was some concern about N95 respirators, but the Trump administration has now shipped over 90 million N95 respirators.  Once again, that is more than three times the average healthcare industry consumption of N95 restorators [sic] — respirators in the typical year.
Finally, the U.S. now leads the world in testing.  For weeks, the media cited South Korea as being the gold standard for testing.  But as it stands, we are now testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea.  And, in fact, as this chart is going to show you, in all 50 states we are now testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea.  So a state in this country is testing at a higher rate per capita than the entire country of South Korea.  That’s pretty extraordinary, I would say.
Now I would like to provide the American people with an update on the Trump administration’s support for underserved communities.  As the President has said, this country is at war with the invisible enemy.  And while we all fight the virus as one united American people, it is a fact that this virus disproportionately has affected those in medically underserved communities, and therefore the President has committed to delivering economic support and quality care for individuals in distressed communities.
The Trump administration, as I announced last week, distributed $12 billion in provider relief payments to 395 hospitals across the country that have been harded [sic] — hardest hit by the coronavirus.  Many of these hospitals were in underserved communities.  And to ensure even more funding to these communities, $2 billion of that overall funding was specifically targeted to hospitals in proportion to the amount of care they provide for low-income and uninsured patients.
Additionally, the Trump administration is investing nearly $2 billion in community health centers to help their 28 million patients in medically underserved areas that receive care and the testing they need.  That’s what this funding is intended for.  And additionally, there’s $583 million awarded to 1,385 health centers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the eight U.S. territories specifically geared towards testing.
These health centers currently provide 100,000 tests per week, and 59 percent of the patients tested last week were from minority communities.
Finally, under the Paycheck Protection Program, the Trump administration has done extensive outreach to the community development financial institution funds across the country.  These are known as CDFIs, and they support revitalization in distressed communities.  In the second round of PPP, 100,000 loans have been distributed to CDFIs and to MDIs, which are known as minority deposit institutions.  These have amounted to about $6.2 billion.
And finally, 570,723 loans have been issued to smaller lenders and non-banks, and these loans have amounted to $29.9 billion.  President Trump will continue to fight for the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of all Americans, especially those impacted in low-income communities and disadvantaged communities.
And with that, I’ll take questions.
Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-051220/

4:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States — the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far.  This afternoon, I’ll also announce new steps that we’re taking to make tests even more widely available.
To battle a virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our nation’s disposal: public, private, military, economic, scientific, and industrial — all at your disposal.  We launched the largest manufacturing ramp-up since the Second World War.  There’s been nothing like it since.
At the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities.  In the span of just a few short months, we’ve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close.  This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America.  And we’re opening, and we’re starting, and there’s enthusiasm like I haven’t seen in a long time.
Every American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill, and enterprise our nation has brought to this challenge.  In three months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States.  Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day.  Now we’re doing approximately 300,000 tests per day — a 100 percent increase — and it will go up substantially from that number.
This week, the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted — nearly double the number of any other country.  We’re testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries — and, in some cases, combined.
On Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen tests, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured.  Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point-of-care test, estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks.
To further expand our nation’s testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration is — and that we’ve got this all approved; it’s all done — is sending $1 billion to America’s states, territories, and tribes.  So this has all been approved.  We’ve gotten it done, completed.  The money is going out.  This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far.
I said from the beginning that the federal government would back up the states and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that’s exactly what’s happened.  This partnership has truly flourished.  We have really had a very good relationship with the states and the governors and other representatives within the states — a relationship like, I think I can honestly say, has not been seen in this country for many, many years.
The governors and us are working together very closely not only on testing, but on ventilators, where we have a capacity that’s, at this point, virtually unlimited.  And we’re sending ventilators — as you probably heard from other countries, we’re sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they’re in tremendous need.  And I think building up a lot of goodwill, but much more importantly than that, we’re saving a lot of lives.
Most states are now doing a great job.  My administration located 5,000 machines in 700 labs across all 50 states, and governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources.
The federal government is also supporting states with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one-on-one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly.
In recent weeks, we’ve held multiple conference calls with every state, as well as with D.C. and Puerto Rico.  We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each state for the month of May, altogether totaling 12.9 million tests.  Think of that: 12.9 million tests.
Today, I’m announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help states meet their targets and meet them rapidly.
During the month of May, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swabs to states nationwide.  We already have them; the delivery will be very quick.  We’re prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any state is on a pace to surpass its goal.  And their goals are very high.  We’ve set them very high, and we’ve told them to set them very high.
My administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing.  A complicated process, but we’ve made it simple.  As a result of these actions, every single state will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in four months since the outbreak began.
This major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher.  Some of these incredible companies produced and produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon.  These are all different products that were literally just developed, and — if you can imagine that.  And these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world.  And other countries are calling us, and we’re trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing.
My administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities.  Through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that’s in addition to all of the other sites that we have working.  Seventy percent of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities.
There will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days.  These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community.  My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy.
In addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90 million N95 masks, and these are of the highest quality — many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn’t have at all at the beginning — 126 million surgical masks — likewise, many are made here; 9 million face shields; 21 million surgical gowns; 993 million gloves; and 10,690 ventilators.  We’re building thousands of ventilators in numerous plants all across our country.  It’s incredible, actually.
This global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people.  It should have never been allowed to happen.  It should have been stopped at the source.  We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one — and that goes worldwide, too.  Many, many countries — 184 countries, at least.
Thanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved.  And we have saved — and if you look at on a per-100,000 basis, we’re at the best part of the pack, right on the bottom.  Germany and us are leading the world.  Germany and the United States are leading the world — lives saved per hundred thousand.
In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task.  We have met the moment, and we have prevailed.  Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.
Day after day, we’re making tremendous strides.  With the dedication of our doctors and nurses — these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors — with the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy, and we will transition into greatness.  That’s a phrase you’re going to hear a lot because that’s what’s going to happen.
We’re going into the third quarter, and we’re going to do well.  In the fourth quarter, we’re going to do very good.  And next year, I think we’re going to have one of the best years we’ve ever had because there’s a tremendous pent-up demand.  It’s a demand — and I’m feeling it.  I’ve felt things a lot over my life, and I’ve made a lot of good calls.  It’s a demand like I don’t think I’ve ever seen.  There’s a pent-up demand.  There’s a — there’s a spirit of this country like few have seen.  And I think you can say — and we’ve helped a lot of the countries a lot.  Really, a lot.  There’s a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing.
But we’re transitioning to greatness, and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter, but it’s really going to be next year, and it’s going to be a year like we’ve never had before.  I really believe that.  As good as we’ve done — and we’ve done great; we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world.  You can talk China, you can talk any other country, we had the best economy anywhere in the world.
And we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers; employment, also, numbers — a little different — where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people.  All of that — we had the greatest stock market numbers ever.  I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time.  A hundred and fifty-two days we set records in the stock market.  We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States.  All of our equipment built — $1.5 trillion plus.
On the southern border, the wall is being built.  It’s being built rapidly.  And now you don’t hear the opponents talking too much about the border.  They don’t like to talk about it because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things.  One of the things we were right about — one of the many things was the border.  We have a very powerful border.  Now, we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border, between the United States and Mexico — our southern border.  We have very few people coming in — very, very few.  Almost record low numbers.
And the wall is being built.  It’s up to 181 miles already.  It’s being built.  It’s being built rapidly.  People don’t talk about it anymore because it’s very successful.  In the area where the wall has built — that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by a very short period of time.  Early next year, we should be up to 450.  And very shortly after that, over 500 miles to be completed.
But it’s had a tremendous impact.  But again, we’ve had the best numbers.  The last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our southern border.  And again, we’re doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers.
So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir — if you could, please come up — and Brad, if you would — Brad Smith.  And they’re going to do a little explaining as to what we’ve done with regard to testing and how successful it’s been.  And then we’ll take some questions after that.
Thank you very much.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration.  And thank you, Secretary Azar, for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I the opportunity to work on this project.
I think it’s clear that America does lead the world in testing.  I’ll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively.  I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem to keep America safe.  And clearly, as we’ve said multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality.
So let’s start potentially with the next slide.
This may be hard to see, but if you look at the line on top, that’s the total numbers of tests done by the United States.  No other country in the world comes close to the total numbers.  Again, as the President has said, today we will top over 9 million tests.  And if you look at per capita — everyone talks about South Korea being the standard — today, we will have done more than twice the per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in South Korea.  No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing.
And how did we get there?  Let’s look at the next slide.  Next slide please.
A very important component of how we came to this point was the authorization by the FDA, under the leadership of our Secretary, of many different diagnostic tests, of diagnostic devices, and now of serology tests.
So you’ve heard a lot about the different testing and you see some of the machines up here.  Most of the diagnostic tests — all but one — rely on the amplification of the viral RNA, the viral genetic material.  And we’ve talked to you about the diversity of tests.  There are very high-throughput tests that are done at big reference labs like LabCorp and Quest.  But very importantly, there are also tests — and you heard us talk about Cepheid, delivering over 2 million tests vitally important to rural America’s — and to places that do not have very large infrastructure.
You’ve also seen the Abbott tests we’ve talked about — there it is on the left of the President — delivering about 1.4 million tests as a point-of-care test.  You get the result within 5 to 15 minutes.  And we have deployed over 235,000 of these tests to the state public health laboratories in every state of this country to make sure that that point-of-care testing capability is there to research outbreaks, like in nursing homes or in certain industrial capacities, and well over 90,000 to the Indian Health Service, so they could test at a point of care in remote locations.
The President also talked about a new first-in-class test; it’s listed there as an antigen-based test.  This is very important — and you’ve heard Ambassador Birx talk about this multiple times — because antigen testing, although complex, is much less complex than the nucleic acid testing that we’ve had.
Quidel had this authorized by the FDA.  And as the President said, we’ll soon be making over 300,000 tests per day.  Do the math.  That’s 9 million point-of-care tests that we will have every month in just a few weeks.  It will clearly add to and, to a certain degree, transform our landscape.
What you don’t see up here is the important work the FDA did.  I’m a swab guy now.  I’m very interested in swabs.  In order to make all these tests work, you have to show that a certain swab, made of a certain material, performed in a certain way, delivers a highly accurate result.
And what you’re seeing up here is some of the fruits of that labor.  Without the authorizations of, for example, the foam nasal swab, we would be blowing through PPE all across the country because of the need for full PPE just to take a test.  That has really been changed by this diverse authorization and a recent authorization that allows the great manufacturer, U.S. Cotton, to join our foundational industry of Puritan.
Next slide.
Last week, we did over 1.9 million tests, and that number is growing.  And again, as the President said and Brad will talk about, our states aspire to do well over 12 million tests over the next four weeks.
You see the graph growing.  What you also see very importantly is that little orange bar on the bottom is the cumulative number of positives.  Our percent positives are going down, and that’s what we want to see.  In fact, in 31 states as of last night, the positivity rate is less than 10 percent, which is not a litmus test, but is a good idea that we’re doing plenty enough testing that we can enter phase one for careful reopening.
I also want to take the opportunity to say this doesn’t happen by accident.  I’m seeing everyone in the audience here, and I’m so pleased that they can be here.  People sitting in the front have been working, literally, 18 to 20 hours a day, every single day of the week, for at least the past two months.  None of this happens by accident.  It happens because their hard work, their sacrifice, their sacrifice to their family all for a common good.  And I’m very, very honored to consider you all as my colleagues.
And my last slide, as the President said, $11 billion are now being announced to be delivered to the states for the sole support of testing.  This will give them the resources to partner, as they have, with the federal government, with the President, the Vice President, the task force, with Brad and I, to achieve their testing goals.  And we’re going to be very specific, and they know it, that there needs to be minimum numbers to be planned to test.  They have to have plans for their vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, including those who are disabled, including those who are in prisons or who have working environments that they may have a more likelihood to spread the infection.
And combined with that, the Secretary’s Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of state, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked to the services that they need — not only testing, but in care as well.
And with that, I’d like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who’s the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together.
Brad.
MR. SMITH:  Thank you, Admiral.  I want to talk through a little bit, specifically the work that we’ve been doing with the states.
So, as the Admiral mentioned, over the past few weeks, we’ve been working with each state to set a target for their testing goal for May.  With — over the series of a couple of different calls, we’ve aligned on what those goals are.  And as the Admiral mentioned and the President mentioned, they add up to over 12.9 million tests in the month of May.
For every state, this is greater than 2 percent of their population in the entire state being tested in May, and for many states, it’s a much higher number than that.  When you compare this, as the President mentioned, to South Korea, South Korea is actually below that 2 percent not for a month, but for their total tests to date since the start of the year.  And so our states have come together to set really ambitious goals that we’re excited to support them in meeting.
If you go to the next slide.  As I talked about last time in the press briefing, there are really three parts to making sure that tests can happen.  The first part is the specimen collection supplies, the second part is the machines, and the third part are the lab supplies that the machines need to run. And what we’ve been working to do is to make sure that each state has all three of those parts to be able to conduct the number of tests.
The first part is the specimen-collection supplies.  The commercial market today is providing a large number of these supplies already to states and already to hospitals, but we wanted to ensure that every state had more than what they needed to be able to conduct the number of tests they’re aiming in May.  So what we’ve done is we’ve purchased enough tests to support the state testing goals for May and June.  So we will be sending more than 12.9 million swabs and over 10 million media to the states over the course of May, and a similar or greater number over the course of June.
In addition, we have several million in reserve.  So if states are able to exceed their goal in third and fourth week of May, we can provide them even more swabs and transport media.  And again, this is in addition to what’s already available on the commercial market.
If you go to the next slide.  There are large numbers that have been talked about many times — a large number of testing machines across the country, over 5,000 different machines that can conduct these tests.  The key part is making sure that the machines and that the labs have enough supplies to run the machines.  There will be, in the month of May, commercially produced, over 25 million test kits, which is either the PCR and extraction kits or the cartridges, to be able to support tests in their effort — states in their testing effort.
And what we’ve been working to do with each state is understand their total goal.  And each of the manufacturers has been a great partner with us and told us how many tests they’re shipping to each lab in each state over the course of May.  And what we know is that, in the aggregate, the number of test kits the state is getting is greater than their testing goal for the month of May.
In addition to what the states have already purchased, there’s over 7 million additional tests that remain unpurchased — the majority of those from Thermo Fisher, which is the most common machine in the country.  So we feel very confident that states will not only have the specimen-collection supplies and the machines, but also the extraction kits and the reagents they need to be able to hit or potentially exceed their testing goals.
And if you go to the last slide.  The last piece of the puzzle is making sure that Americans have access to these tests.  Healthcare providers, hospitals, primary care physicians are already providing these tests today.  And we, for the past six or seven weeks, have been partnering with the retailers who have massively been ramping up their effort.
Today there are over 240 retail sites.  We’ve been working with the retailers to make sure that they’re specifically targeting low-income and other vulnerable communities across the country, and we are talking with them about potentially opening more than another thousand additional sites over the next month or two.
So we hope that we’ve put together the right pieces of the puzzle: having access points for patients and Americans across the country, having the specimen-collection supplies needed to take the test, having the machines, and then also having the lab testing supplies with the machines.
So, thank you very much.

12:38 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon.  Today marks the 75th anniversary of VE Day, a triumphant milestone in our nation’s history and indeed in world history.  Seventy-five years ago today, our brave American forces defeated fascism in Europe.  And through the selfless devotion of thousands of patriots, they saved the world.
Over 180,000 Americans gave their lives in the European theater during World War Two.  And I want to take just a moment to honor their service and their sacrifice.  Thank you to all of our veterans.  You are truly, truly our heroes.
Now, as I move to my next subject, I want to begin by saying this: Look, our rank-and-file men and women at the FBI are heroes in their own right.  They protect this country from domestic crime, and we thank them for their service.  They work hard.  And once again, we owe them a debt of gratitude.  But that is separate and apart from what I’m about to address right now.
The FBI exists to investigate crimes.  But in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, it appears that they might have existed to manufacture one.  As the motion filed by the Department of Justice yesterday explained, the FBI set out to interview General Michael Flynn, when they had no predigate [sic] — predicate for any investigation of any crime.
Over the past week, we learned, from a handwritten note, the true intent behind the FBI’s investigation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.  The very day that then-FBI Director Jim Comey sent agents to the White House to interview Flynn, the FBI discussed what their intent was beforehand.  This is what they said: “What is our goal?  Truth, admission?  Or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”  These notes, in addition to other evidence, raise serious questions about the handling of the — of the FBI’s handling of Michael Flynn’s case.
Did the FBI confront Flynn with the intent to get him to lie so that we can prosecute him and fire him?  Did the FBI manufacture a crime against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn?
Federal investigators appear to paint a target on the back of General Michael Flynn.  Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal laid out, point by point, the very concerning aspects of this case, and I’m going to reiterate them as outlined in her column over the weekend:
In December 2016, Flynn spoke as the incoming national security advisor to the Russian ambassador.  This call, as is customary, was recorded by the United States government.  They record calls with foreigners.  But in a highly irregular move, the intelligence community, under the Obama administration, unmasked the identity of Michael Flynn, a United States citizen, who is entitled to Fourth Amendment rights and to due process.  But Lieutenant General Michael Flynn received none of that.
The intelligence community was hunting for evidence against General Flynn — evidence they did not find.  We learned from newly released transcripts that in stark contrast to what former DNI James Clapper had been saying publicly, and contrary to what he was saying publicly, here’s what he was saying privately with regard to Russian collusion: “I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting [or] conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.”  Sounds awfully different from what he just said 10 days prior in a public capacity.
Having found no evidence of Russian collusion, the FBI came up with a new absurd theory that Flynn might have violated the Logan Act, a statute from 1799 that, in its 200 years of existence, had never been used to convict an American citizen, but it was resurrected in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.
Michael Flynn didn’t violate the Logan Act.  Even the FBI did not think that General Flynn’s telephone call provided the predicate for a criminal investigation.  In fact, in January of 2017, an internal FBI document concluded that Flynn was, quote, “no longer a valid viable candidate for investigation.”  Disgraced FBI agent and noted Trump hater, Peter Strzok, disagreed, texting this: “Hey, if you haven’t closed that Flynn case yet, don’t do so yet.” End quote.  So the Flynn case remained active.  This was a good thing for Peter Strzok, but it was a bad thing for justice.  It was a bad thing for the rule of law.
According to yesterday’s motion to dismiss the case against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, it said this: Mr. Strzok immediately relayed the, quote, “serendipitously good” news to Lisa Page, special counsel at the FBI, remarking, quote, “our utter incompetence actually helps us.”  That’s right.  Their utter incompetence to close the case against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was something to be serendipitously celebrated.
The scheme to manufacture a case against Michael Flynn continued.  After President Trump entered office, the FBI’s partisan pursuit of General Flynn proceeded under Jim Comey’s FBI.  Despite possessing a transcript of Flynn’s entire conversation, the FBI decided it was somehow necessary to go ask General Flynn what happened on the call, despite having a transcript in their possession.  The only motive would have been to, quote, “get him to lie.”
They advised him he didn’t need a lawyer present.  Imagine that: “You’re an American citizen.  You don’t need a lawyer.  We’re just coming in to have a chat.”  They didn’t inform their superiors at the Department of Justice about their intent to interview Flynn, despite their own attorney at the FBI saying, “If we usually tell the White House, then I think we need to do what we normally do.”  But they ignored the advice of FBI counsel, and they went in to interrogate Michael Flynn.
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, no fan of President Trump, said she was “flabbergasted.”  She was “dumbfounded” by the decision to not inform DOJ officials who, quote, “hit the roof.”  This is all outlined in a legal document that you can find.
Additionally, when the FBI arrived at the White House, they did not even warn lawyer-less Flynn about the consequences for providing an inaccurate response.  The interrogation of Michael Flynn was not an inquiry.  Make no mistake: It was a trap.  Even more troubling was the fact that after the interrogation of Flynn, former Deputy Director of the FBI Andy McCabe concluded that he, quote, “didn’t think Flynn was lying.”  But the case against Flynn continued.
We were pleased to learn yesterday that the Justice Department moved to drop the case against General Michael Flynn.  Though it took several years, it is encouraging to see that justice finally prevailed.  As we move forward as a country, it’s important to take these revelations very seriously in order for Americans to have faith in our justice system.
If the top leadership of the FBI can target a three-star general who served this country for three decades, make no mistake, they can target you.  It’s hard to believe that this happened in the United States of America.
General Michael Flynn’s life was forever changed.  He had to sell his home.  He faced financial ruin.  His family was even threatened with prosecution.  But despite all of that, here’s what Michael Flynn put out yesterday in his first reaction to the motion to dismiss.  If we can play the video, let’s go ahead and play it.
I don’t think we have the video queued, but I encourage you all to go on General Twynn’s [sic] — Flynn’s Twitter feed, and what you’ll see is a really beautiful video of his grandson talking about how much he loves this country and how everyone deserves justice for all.  And how commendable that is for General Flynn, at a time when he was so gravely wronged to say this: I still believe in this country.  I still believe in America.  I still believe in the principles that make this country the greatest on Earth.
And in the words of renowned political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu, “There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and in the name of justice.”
I hope the media will take these questions very seriously, will report the facts.  There was heavy interest in the first iteration of Flynn news from many years ago that got four times the coverage that the exoneration of Michael Flynn got today.  That was a report by Media Research Center.  So these facts are important, and thank you very much for those who have taken interest in reporting.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-050820/

4:32 P.M. EDT

MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to direct your attention to a very encouraging graph regarding test results.  It’ll be over my shoulder and hopefully on the screen for those of you watching on television.  As this chart shows, the United States has, to date, completed 7.5 million coronavirus tests.  It’s an extraordinary number.  And, as you can see, the United States leads the world in testing. 

This graph is no accident.  In fact, this graph is a testament to American innovation, including the work of the Trump administration.  For example, the FDA has issued over 70 emergency use authorizations to expand testing capacity to accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  There are nearly 80 clinical trials ongoing with an additional 30 clinical trials expected. 

This graph is also a testament to the American people who have been — and it’s no exaggeration — American warriors, as they’ve followed social distancing guidelines and taken steps to ensure that the health and safety of our vulnerable populations is protected. 

Finally, I would like to note that this graph indicates that the U.S. has conducted double the number of tests conducted in other countries.  The U.S. is providing leadership during this crisis, not only leading the world in testing, but also taking steps to help allies around the world — steps we are able to take only because of this country’s incredible ingenuity and work ethic. 

As you’re well aware, President Trump has consistently sided with the experts and has always prioritized the health and safety of the American people.  This includes issuing guidance that meant hardworking Americans had to stay home, social distance, and slow the spread of the virus.  The hard work of Americans saved many lives, and we salute the great citizens of this country for your hard work. 

As Americans across the country stayed home and businesses temporarily shut their doors, President Trump ensured American employees and employers would receive the help that they needed.  The Paycheck Protection Program provided forgivable loans to small-business owners who kept their employees on payroll. 

To date, 2.3 million small-business loans have been processed, with the average loan being $76,000.  In other words, meaning that the small businesses that needed the help the most got it.  I would remind everyone that, of the 1.6 million loans given out in the first tranche of spending, one million of those went to businesses with 10 or fewer employees.  So it truly has gone to those who need it most. 

Joe Shamess is a small-business owner.  Joe, with his co-founder Brian Steorts are two veteran special operators in the military who started Flags of Valor in 2015.  It’s a veteran-owned, veteran-run manufacturing company located not too far from here in Virginia. 

Flags of Valor builds wooden flags, among other products.  They’ve employed, over their years, 65 veterans and have raised over $1 million for veteran charities.  Flags of Valor is also proud to have 97,000 hours of American manufacturing labor under their belt.  That’s a lot of hours. 

At the start of this crisis, Joe had to furlough four of his employees, in addition to imposing a 50 percent pay cut.  His employees were, of course, disappointed but they were, quote, in his words, “all in,” in the fight against the coronavirus. 

Everything changed for Joe and his furloughed employees when he applied for the PPP loan.  Just this week, he was approved for that PPP loan that enabled Flags of Valor to rehire its furloughed employees and to boost paychecks back to pre-coronavirus levels.  “PPP was a huge lifeline for us,” Joe told me.  He called it a lifesaver. 

This is a perfect example of why President Trump fought for additional PPP funding and will continue to fight for small businesses and American heroes like Joe.  Joe is here with me today, and I’d like to invite him to come up. 

Joe, thank you so much for your service.  Thank you for all the great work you’ve done for our veterans and being a veteran yourself.  I wanted to see if you’d take to the podium for a minute or two and share your message of hope with the American people. 

MR. SHAMESS:  I’d love to.  Thank you, Kayleigh, and thank you, President Trump, for allowing me to be here today.  I’ve got a couple props.  This is examples of one of our products that we make, and here’s another one.  This one, my son Gabriel made. 

And when — when you talk about hope and what’s going on, it’s a — it’s a challenging time for small business.  We lost two-thirds of our revenue like that.  Gone.  And so trying to get that back, and when you think about a small business that generally is running maybe it’s 10 to 20 percent profit margin, two-thirds is a killer. 

And so when you think about the Paycheck Protection Program, the two biggest fixed costs for most businesses is people and property.  And that’s exactly what the PPP focused on. 

So, for us, it was a lifesaver.  It was an absolute game changer.  We went from trying to figure out how we were going to limit our cash burn every single day to stay alive as long as we could, with as many people as we could, to finally bring them back.  And when you have to furlough someone, I’m telling you, it is one of the worst things you can do because you’re talking about family.  These are people.  These are their — their wives, their husbands, their children.  They’re a part of your ethos. 

And so what we’ve experienced has been challenging, sure.  But when there hasn’t been all the revenue, there’s been people helping other people.  And the way we approached it was, how can we be better?  How can we exit COVID-19 a better version of ourselves?  How can we innovate? 

And so we saw people like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the SBA step in.  We saw our partners at Under Armour step in.  We saw innovation — you see companies making respirator masks.  You see all kinds of stuff going on.  And we created the flag boat kit because families were at home with their kids.  They didn’t know what to do with their children.  And we believe this is our nation’s family crest.  So, what better thing than allow families to build American flags together and talk about that and what it means? 

And then we started a twice-a-day, daily pledge at 9:00 a.m. in the morning on the East Coast and again at 9:00 a.m. on the West Coast.  Every day we’ve got thousands of kids and their families joining us to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  It’s phenomenal.  And all that’s happening by people coming together, by people thinking and innovating. 

And — and I can’t tell you enough how grateful we are to the U.S. government, the bipartisanship that took place to pass the Paycheck Protection Program.  It was all hands on deck.  It wasn’t like — there was no script for this.  And they built the parachute on the way down. 

And when you think about it, you want to talk about the Lakers got it or somebody else got it — think about the millions of businesses that are being benefitted by this.  And it’s, I think, 47 percent of U.S. private-sector employees are in small businesses.  They work for small businesses. 

And so, all the big businesses we love, they started as small businesses.  And I hope to be a big business someday, but for now, I’m happy to be alive.  I’m thankful for your support.  And thank you, Kayleigh, for letting me be here. 

So, join us at FlagsofValor.com.  Thank you. 

MS. MCENANY:  Joe, if you want to take a seat with the reporters, you can ask me some questions. 

MR. SHAMESS:  I’m happy right here.

MS. MCENANY:  Joe, it’s veterans like you that make our country great.  It’s small-business owners like you that are going to bring this country back.  And employees like the one we heard from last week — Michael Heup, the employee of Bitty & Beau’s Coffee — that keep this country going.  So thank you so much for the example you’ve set and to the hardworking business owners across the country, to the employees across this country who are working during this time.  So, thank you, Joe.  Thank you for your service.

As I said, PPP has changed lives across this country.  And as President Trump has said, the American people are warriors and we will fight together to defeat the invisible enemy.

And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-050620/

2:11 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, good afternoon.  I have an announcement for you on hospital funding as appropriated in the third phase of coronavirus relief.
The Trump administration will distribute a total of $12 billion in Provider Relief Fund payments to 395 hospitals across the country that have been hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These hospitals have collectively cared for over 70 percent of the 184,000 Americans that required hospital inpatient care.  Ten billion of the twelve billion will go towards hospitals treating 100 or more COVID-19 admissions.  HHS is distributing an additional $2 billion to these 395 hospitals in proportion to the amount of care they provide to low-income and uninsured patients.
This is consistent with our effort to ensure that Americans who need federal government assistance the most receive it.  We’ll be releasing a breakdown of the states receiving this funding and the counties receiving this funding.  But for your awareness, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois received the most funding by states, while New York, New York; Bronx, New York; and Cook, Illinois received the most funding by county as determined by our metrics.
Our healthcare providers, as President Trump has repeatedly acknowledged, are our heroes as we work to defeat the invisible enemy.  This relief funding will help these heroes defeat this virus.  In reacting to CARES relief, I love what this one provider said.  So he said, “Thank you and God” — “Thank you and God for this relief.  I have tears in my eyes out of gratitude for these funds.  Thank you so, so, so much.”
Additionally, 100 flights as part of Project Airbridge have been completed to date.  These flights have expedited nearly 1 billion pieces of PPE for our healthcare heroes.
The third phase of coronavirus relief also included $320 billion in additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, which, as you all know, provides forgivable loans to small businesses in order to keep their employees on payroll.
This program has been extraordinarily successful during the first round of PPP loans: 1.6 million loans were issued to small businesses.  Of those 1.6 million loans, 1 million of them were given to companies with 10 or fewer employees.  So it has gone to small businesses and businesses that need it most.
But the PPP — look, it’s not just another government program.  This is supporting everyday Americans who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves in this predicament.  We saw this firsthand at the White House on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, President Trump welcomed small-business owners and employees to the White House.  These small businesses received PPP loans, which helped them pay their employees during the pandemic.
Bitty and Beau’s was among the small businesses welcomed to the White House.  Bitty and Beau’s employs 120 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  It’s a coffee shop not too far away from here.  Bitty and Beau’s had to temporarily close its doors, but because of PPP loans, Bitty and Beau’s was able to rehire all of its employees.
I had the real honor of getting to meet Michael Heup.  He’s one of the employees at Bitty and Beau’s, and he offered some words of encouragement to our country.  And they really touched my heart, and I think they’ll touch the heart of America, if you guys wouldn’t mind playing those remarks.
(A video is played.)
Michael is an incredible young man.  I gave him a call yesterday and asked him what he was up to, and he said he and his fellow employees were literally handwriting notes to put in with their coffee packages that they send out to consumers.  I received one of these notes from another company, and it really does put a smile on your face.  And Michael is doing that each and every day.
And Bitty and Beau’s, they represent the hope and opportunity that is on the horizon for America’s workers as their body, their — their business, rather, embodies the American spirit.  Workers, like Michael, show that this country is not broken and that we will recover together.
Michael, thank you.  You’re an American hero.  Thank you for sharing that message of hope.

5:38 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today I’d like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus.  Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens — we’ve had such tremendous support all over — we continue to see encouraging signs of progress.
Cases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining.  Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St. Louis are all stable and declining.  All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better.  In all cases, getting better.  And we’re seeing very little that we’re going to look at as a superseding hotspot.  Things are moving along.  Really, a horrible situation that we’ve been confronted with, but they’re moving along.
As we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains, however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy.  We grieve by their side as one family — this great American family.  And we do grieve.
We also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus.  We’re doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually re-open our nation, and to safely get our people back to work.  They want to get back to work, and they want to get back to work soon.  There’s a hunger for getting our country back, and it’s happening, and it’s happening faster than people would think.
Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation.  These goals work in tandem.  They work side by side.
It’s clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives.  For those who are infected, we have taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world.  The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment, as you know — in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it; some of our greatest executives — some of the greatest anywhere in the world — and distributed over 10,000 ventilators.
And we now have, in a very short period of time — many have been delivered, and hundreds of thousands are being built.  And frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with.  They’re actually shipping them to different locations, and we’re shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world, because we have ventilators like — the job that they’ve done in getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible.  You don’t hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way.
We’ve launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise, on Earth.  The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests — nearly double the number tested in any other country.  More than twice as much as any other country.  Think of that.
Moments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger.  We’re joined by leaders of those great companies.  And we also have with us the leaders from the world’s top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers: Thermo Fisher, LabCorp, Quest, U.S. Cotton, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association.  These are great — great companies.
These private-sector leaders, along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic, and Cephe– Cepheid, have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the states’ capabilities and our country’s capabilities.  The job they’ve done has been incredible.  The testing that’s been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing.
I want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they’ve done.  I want to thank Roche.  And in particular, those two have really stepped forward.  Abbott with a five-minute test that people can take, and in five minutes they know what the — what the answer is.
I’d like to ask, if I could, the executives of these great companies — and they are — they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period.  We’re talking about a 45-day period when many of us met.  And since then, what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing.
So I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company.  Plus, they’re going to make a big contribution to our country.
Please.  Come forward, please.  Thank you.
MR. RUSCKOWSKI:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for — all of you for being here today.  And what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made.
The last time we were here was March 13th, and we’ve made tremendous progress.  And none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock, working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need.
As far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress.  We are currently, at Quest Diagnostics, testing about 50,000 tests per day.  We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number by the end of May.  We’ll have 100,000 tests per day — about 3 million tests — and these are the molecular tests that we do today.
We have also brought up serological testing.  We started that this past week, and by the end of May, we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month.  So you put those two numbers together, and it’s about 10 million tests by the end of May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics.
We’re doing that also in a quicker way.  Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue in the early days.  We’ve reduced that to one to two days.  Our turnaround time for people in beds — hospital beds — is less than 24 hours.  And we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA, delivering the quality that you all expect.  And convenience will improve, as well, with convenient solutions that we’ll be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer — the ability to have consumers choose a test online with a telehealth provider.
So with that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
MR. SCHECHTER:  Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today.  Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible.
Just 45 days ago, we said we could do several thousand tests a day.  We can now do 60,000 tests a day, and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.
In addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier.  We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test.  That test, right now, is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks, and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers.
At the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing, and we can currently do about 50,000 today, and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May.  And we’re going to be working with the retailers — our colleagues that are here today — to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country.
And lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development business, and we will continue to work with our colleagues in the pharmaceutical and the biotech — biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Please, go ahead.  Please.
MR. CASPER:  Mr. President, thank you and thank — and thank the administration for all of the collaboration to enable Thermo Fisher Scientific to be able to produce the test kits that companies like LabCorp and Quest and the public health labs around the world run.
We met our original commitments of producing 5 million kits a week, and we’re up to scaling that to double that in the coming weeks in terms of supporting testing around the world.
I’d like to thank my 75,000 colleagues around the world for their tireless effort to make that a reality and supporting all of — all of our customers to have the testing necessary to get America back to work.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
MR. NIMS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m John Nims with U.S. Cotton, and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits.  We have about 1,200 people in our company.  And in our Cleveland operation, they have pivoted from, as you’ve said, the Q-tip-style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits.
Our Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this, and I’m very — they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort.
So thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
MR. MERLO:  Mr. President, thank you.  I’m Larry Merlo with CVS Health.  And it was just over a month ago that we opened up our first drive-through test site.  And since that time, we have opened large-scale testing facilities across five states in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, and Michigan.
And these sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with real-time results.  We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week.  And this afternoon, we announced plans to expand that capacity even further.
Beginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to 1,000 CVS pharmacies.  We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing.  So again, you’ll see that coming online, you know, in May.
And we also recognize the fact that the virus is disproportionately affecting our minority communities.  So we’re working in partnership with organizations like the National Medical Association to bring testing and care into the traditionally underserved communities.
We’re also beginning to implement mobile capabilities with which to do that.  And as businesses are restarting their workforce, we’ll also be looking to assist them, you know, as they begin to come back to a normal operation.
And finally, as my other colleagues, I just want to thank my CVS colleagues.  They have done a phenomenal job in terms of helping people in many different ways all across communities in the country.  And they’re part of this army of healthcare professionals and, you know, front-store and, you know, first-line supervisors and workers that are doing terrific things to bring our country together.  And, for that, we owe them a huge amount of gratitude.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.
MR. ASHWORTH:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Appreciate the invitation to be here today.  And it was just 45 days ago when we were here.  I’m Richard Ashworth.  I oversee Walgreens in the U.S.  And I just want to start off — Larry, like you — thanking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers — you know, giving them essential daily needs; the prescriptions, obviously, that they need; and even COVID testing while we’re here.
We also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all states, including Puerto Rico.  We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now, in partnership with our lab partners, and we’re excited to be able to do that.
We’re really excited with the public-private partnership that we have here, because that’s what’s enabling us to do this, and we look forward to working with the additional states to get these sites up and running as fast as possible.
As a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing: I’m really proud to be part of this profession.  And not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them, across grocery — mass, independents.  You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for: to help patients, counseling them on their medicines, and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing.
You know, pharmacy is right here in it with everyone, together in the community, and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now; serology, whatever that might look like in the future; and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come.
So thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you very much.
MR. ASHWORTH:  Thank you.
MR. MCMULLEN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  We appreciate all you’re doing to get America back to work and doing it safely.
I represent Kroger, and my name is Rodney McMullen, and I am so proud of our nearly half a million associates that are doing everything, every day, to keep customers safe and our associates safe.
And one of the things that we were able to do is provide the basic practices we’re doing.  We call it “blueprint.”  And it’s the things that all of us can learn from on how to get America back working.
We also announced earlier today, continuing to accelerate our practice on testing.  We are actively engaged in six states.  Next — in the next couple of weeks, we’ll take that to 12 states, and the number of tests that we do continues to grow faster than that.
Together, we will win.  Together, we will solve this problem and move on.  America is always great.  Thank you again.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
MR. MCMILLON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My name is Doug McMillon.  I’m a Walmart associate.  And I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our stores, Sam’s Clubs, distribution centers, and in our e-commerce fulfillment centers.  They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can-do attitude and step up.  It’s much appreciated.
We started 45 days ago, as did everyone else, and we’ve been operating sites for a while now.  We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 states.  By the end of next week, we’ll be to 45, and by the end of the May — end of May, we’ll be at 100.
We also — a few weeks ago, Vice President Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia — a food distribution center.  He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated.
And the President and Vice President were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns, and the President asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns.  And we don’t normally buy those, so I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that.  But I’d like to thank our apparel team, and McKesson in particular, for partnering with us.  We’ve been able to, in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns.  And by the end of May, we’ll have an additional 6 million available to help.
So thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doug.  Great job.  Thank you.
MS. DONIGAN:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country.  I’m Heyward Donigan with Rite Aid.  And we are currently operating 40 percent of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight states.
And we had the — I had the opportunity, as I was driving up, to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates — whether it be security or pharmacy front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much.  It was really amazing to see.
And I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times.  It’s been quite amazing.  And we too are going to expand our testing, and we’re doing about 1,500 a day.
Thanks.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
So thank you all very much.  It’s incredible what we’ve done together over a short period of time.  I want to thank our Vice President for the task force and the work.  Every day, it gets better.
And we had a fantastic goal with the governors today, and I would say that they are as — as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country.  It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way.  And the whole world is suffering because of it — 184 countries at least.
But I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they’ve done.  They have been fantastic with us, working with us.  And, as you know, for several weeks, my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in states.  Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity.
Then, one week ago, we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their states.  Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket.
On Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number — bigger than any country anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time; a number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day.  So we much more than doubled it, and that will be doubling again very shortly.
We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening.  And the reopening process — we want to get our country open.  And the testing is not going to be a problem at all.  In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.
Today we’re releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the states as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening.  Our blueprint describes how states should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks, and conduct contact tracing.  We have it all.
Other countries are calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it.  And we’re helping them.  We’re dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing, just like we did on the ventilators.
I directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need.  And the pharmacies — as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing.  And we have other testing locations that we’re going to be allowing also, but having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal.  We’re also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program.  So they’re going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid.  So it’s a big — that’s a big deal.
So we’re deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help states, cities — to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast.  There’s tremendous energy in our country right now.  There’s energy like people haven’t seen in a long time — a spirit that they have not seen.  And we’re doing very well — very well — considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others.
This is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time.  You can probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time.  You all know what happened in 1917.  That’s over 100 years ago.
With that, I’d like to introduce, if I might — Dr. Birx, if you could come up.  And then, Admiral, you’ll come up.  And between the two of you, you’ll explain the entire process and how much progress we’ve made and where we’re going.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  So the blueprint lays out the roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private sector and the public sector, bringing together state and local governments with the federal government to ensure that we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives.
If we can have the first slide.  The core elements of the testing plan include both three elements: robust diagnostic testing plans developed in partnerships with state — and I just really want to thank the governors and the health officials, both at the state and local levels who have been working with us day and night to work through these issues, and also all the laboratory directors in many of those states, as well as the American Society for Microbiology, who have been working with us to ensure that the plans were efficient and effective.
Within the robust diagnostic testing plans, it was really unlocking the full capacity of the state: increasing the number of testing planforms — we now have multiple tests for different platforms; increasing the ability to collect samples; increasing testing and laboratory supplies; and ensuring that we work together to make sure that every client receives the test that they need.
This is added with timely monitoring systems.  And what do I mean by that?  Systems where we bring together the ability to not only diagnose the symptomatic, but proactively and interactively work with individuals that we know are at higher risk.  We’ve worked with states to look at where the outbreaks have occurred when they’re not in the large metros, and we see that it occurs very often in places of close settings, among our Native Americans and among our long-term care facilities.  So an active monitoring program that’s active, integrated, and innovative.
And then combining this with the third element, which is the rapid response program, relying on CDC to be working with state and local governments to ensure that every symptomatic case — and, critically, the asymptomatic cases — are quickly tracked and traced to ensure that we can not only control this epidemic, but predict outbreaks before they expand.
And then, finally, the plan includes an approach of using science and technology to develop even newer platforms, more efficient testing, really ensuring that the antibody tests that are utilized and recommended by both FDA and CDC have high quality and predicting both exposure to the virus and antibody development.
And then, finally, working on innovative tests that could be high throughput and point-of-care — an antigen-based test or a point-of-care expanded nucleic acid test.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you.  Good job.
Admiral, please.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you, Ambassador Birx.  If I could have the next slide, please.
I want to spend just a couple minutes about telling — going over where we’ve been, but more importantly where we’re going.  I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct phases.
First is our launch phase, when we were really engaging the emerging epidemic and the types of things we need to do.  For example, mobilize the private sector to develop tests and have EUAs.  And I think you know, over the past two months, the FDA has issued 67 emergency use authorizations, which is far outpacing anything that has been done or could ever have been imagined.  Galvanizing the research community and the commercial labs — the reason why we’re here with ACLA labs, having done about 3 million tests, is because of that day when it was galvanized by the President and the Vice President.
We also set models in the community.  Those first community-based testing sites that were federally supported and, really, under the direction of the U.S. Public Health Service — people who had been in Japan, testing people on the Diamond Princess, to assure that it would be done right and it would be done safely for everyone involved.
Then we moved to, really, scaling.  That phase was very, very important because we knew we needed to be at an immense scale to enter the third phase about supporting opening again.  This again — for example, a lot of my life is about swabs.  It was enhancing the production capability of a small company in Maine, called Puritan, that you’ll hear a whole lot more about that has — that is, sort of, the swab provider for the country — but also, because of the FDA actions and the actions of scientific community, being able to broaden the types to spun polyester, so U.S. Cotton can now come in and start delivering, within the next couple of weeks, 3 million swabs per week of a different type.
It also did things like expanding the community-based testing sites.  Whereas we started small with the commercial partners, you see today, right now, we have 73 of these 2.0 sites going to 110.  And very importantly, this demonstrated the model.  And 68 percent of those sites are in communities of moderate or high social vulnerability.  And 22 percent are in the highest social vulnerability communities so that we can make sure that testing gets where it needs to be.  You’ve just heard that that could be expanded to thousands of sites.
And finally, stage three, which is very exciting: coordinating with governors to support testing plans and rapid response programs.  Over the past week, a multidisciplinary team from the White House, HHS, FDA, FEMA has met virtually with multidisciplinary teams from every state, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to understand what their testing aspirations are and to make sure that we can meet those demands.  We’re going to have another round of those calls this week.
But as we talked about earlier today, we will be able to supply every state with the — with the supplies and the tests that they need.  That will dramatically increase the number of tests we’ve done to this point.  And just to give you an idea, the supplies that we will be providing to states — the minimum that we’re supplying to states is approximately double, in that month, than the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months to now accumulated — to give you an idea of the amount of testing that we’re going to be — going to be doing.
So I’m very exciting right now, as we complete this ecosystem with the large reference labs — the LabCorp and Quest providing the very high-throughput, large-scale testing; the galvanizing of the hospitals and academic labs that Dr. Birx has done, by a machine to machine, understanding and promoting that with the governors; and, of course, using point-of-care testing when and where that’s very important to stop outbreaks or in remote areas, like in the Indian Health Service or in Alaska.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  Thanks, Brett.
Okay.  So with that, we’re here to answer some questions, and Mike is up here also.  So, we’ll answer.
Steve, please go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-33/

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Thank you.  We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level.  Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly.
Last week, roughly 38 percent of the tests in New York were positive.  This week, that number is down to 28 percent.  New cases in New York are down 50 percent compared to a week ago.  And fatalities are down 40 percent over the same period.  In Louisiana, the rate of positive test result had declined from 25 percent down to 15 percent in the last seven days alone.
Eighteen states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days.  So, over the last seven days, there’s been very, very significant progress.
Half of all Americans live in states that have now taken steps to open their economies.  Just yesterday, Governors Gavin Newsom, California; Tim Walz of Minnesota; and Bill Lee of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors.
We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings.  We’re opening our country.  It’s very exciting to see.  We have a lot of talent involved, from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors.  There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country.  The country is a great place, and it’s going to be greater than ever before.  I really believe that.  I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift.
I spoke with Tim Cook, today, of Apple.  And they have a good sense of the market, and he feels it’s going to be a “V.”  The “V” is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.
Today, I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll.  Thirty billion dollars of the Paycheck Protection funds will be reserved for small financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American small-business owners and their employees.
The bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals — so badly needed for hospitals; they’ve taken a very big hit — and medical providers.  In areas less affected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care.
Under the CARES Act, we’re sending back payments to millions of American workers.  More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment: $3,400 for a typical family of four.  Three thousand four hundred dollars.  That’s great.  And you deserve it.
The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving.  To fulfill the requirement, the Treasury Department is mailing a letter to me.  It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrived — direct deposit, check, or prepaid debit card — as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family.  And that’s what’s been happening.
The whole world is watching us.  You have 184 countries out there that have been hit, and now it’s probably higher than that.  But they’re all watching us.  They’re all watching and they’re calling, and they respect what we’re doing, so much.
I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today.  They’re asking if we can send them ventilators, and I’m agreeing to do it.  We have tremendous capacity — now, over-capacity of ventilators.  We’re filling up stockpiles for our states and for ourselves.  The federal government has over 10,000 ventilators, and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that.  But we’re helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France.  We’re sending to France.  We’re sending to Spain.  We’re sending to Italy.  And we’ll probably be sending to Germany, should they need them.
Over the last three years, we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen.  Greatest economy the world has ever seen.  Nobody has ever done anything like what we were able to do.
And we will rebuild that economy.  Our economy in the not-too-distant future, I really believe, with all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve done, will be just as strong and maybe stronger than ever before — even stronger than it was just two months ago.
Some interesting note is that the FDA approved the first at-home COVID-19 test kit.  It just got approved.  And Dr. Stephen — where is Stephen?  Stephen Hahn.  Stephen?  — is going to say a couple of words about that and some other things.
I want to thank Stephen.  The FDA has been incredible. They’ve been approving not only this, but they’ve been approving many things at a pace that’s never happened before.  And they’re being very safe about it, as Stephen told me.  He’s told me — told me very strongly.  But at the same time, they’re approving things at record numbers, in a record — at a record rate.  And it’s really been helpful.
Many tests are going on — many vaccine tests and tests of every different kind.  And things are happening.  Just like this event, things are happening very rapidly.  And I’d like to have Stephen tell you a little bit about it.
Thank you very much.  Stephen, please.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I appreciate the opportunity to tell you about what’s happening at the FDA.  We have a team of more than 18,000 employees, including 10,000 scientists, doctors, pharmacists, and nurses, and they’ve been working around the clock because, as you probably know, many of the medical products that are being used for the COVID-19 outbreak are, in fact, regulated by FDA.  The staff have been hard at work authorizing tests and other medical products.
As part of these efforts to support diagnostic test development during this global pandemic, the President has asked us, and under his leadership, to actually cut down as many barriers as we possibly could to get medical products into the medical community, and we have done that, of course recognizing the urgency of the situation.
I do want to emphasize what the President said, that — is that we are very much paying attention to safety and with respect to test validity and reliability of those tests.
And I think it’s really important to understand how far we’ve come in just a few short months.  The academic community, which I come from; the private sector; the government — we’ve come together to develop diagnostics for a completely new infectious disease.
And it’s really important — we’ve heard from many test developers, both in academia and in the manufacturing world: This normally takes years to develop.  You’ve heard Dr. Birx talk about the fact that HIV tests has taken many, many years to develop.  This has happened in weeks and months.  We’ve been laser focused on working with both industry and academia to actually make this happen.
To date, under our emergency use authorization approach, we’ve quickly reviewed and authorized 63 tests, both diagnostic, as well as serologic — that is the antibody test.  We’ve had several point-of-care tests, and that’s important because those can be done in the emergency room or in a doctor’s office, et cetera, and much more convenient for the patient.
And this week, as the President said, we authorized the first at-home test by a company called LabCorp.  This is a test where, under certain circumstances, with a doctor’s supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient and the patient can perform the self-swab and then mail it back and get the results after that time — all under the guidance of a licensed physician.
And we’re not just letting up with these 63 tests we’ve approved.  We are working with more than 400 test developers who are pursuing authorization for their diagnostics under our current policies.  And under our regulatory approach, which is quite flexible, many other tests are becoming available.
We are — we have heard, and have reported to us, 220 labs around the country have begun patient testing using their own validated tests.  This has allowed us to increase, significantly, tests around the country.
I updated you earlier this week on serologic tests — these antibody tests that are used to detect natural immunity — and the FDA’s approach to help make these tests available.  While these are just one part of our larger response effort, they can play a role in helping move our economy forward by helping healthcare professionals identify those who have immunity to the COVID-19.
And just finally, when it comes to therapeutics, we are leaving no stone unturned in finding treatments for COVID-19.  You do know that we don’t have any approved currently therapeutics for COVID-19, but we are actively involved with both the academic and the commercial and private sector to find those.  Seventy-two trials of therapeutics are underway in the United States under FDA oversight and 211 are in the planning stages, so we expect to see more.  This includes convalescent plasma, as well as antiviral therapies.
Work continues on vaccines.  And two firms have announced that the FDA has authorized their trials to go forward, one of which we’ve mentioned here before.
And finally, in response to the President’s and Task Force’s request, we’ve stood up the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.  We are leaving no stone unturned, as I said, and we’re working around the clock to develop these therapeutics for the American people.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-32/

5:48 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.  I’m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses.
At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.  You see states are starting to open up now, and it’s very exciting to see.  I think it’s very awe-inspiring.  We’re coming out of it, and we’re coming out of it well.
And we’re — really, I’m very happy the governors have been — the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it’s — it’s, really, pretty impressive to see.  I’ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we’re leading the way.  We’re really leading the way in so many different ways.
I’m also very pleased that Harvard — as you know, it’s Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us.  And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at.  And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it’s about $350 million, and they’ve either not gone out or we’ve renegotiated it and they’re not getting them.
So — and it’s — in a couple of cases, they’re sending them back and sending them back immediately.  So I think it was very nice.  I want to thank Harvard in particular.  They acted very quickly and decisively.  And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it.  So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions.
The bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses.
As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we’re making great progress.  In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak — week.  Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases.  Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms.  That’s a big number.
To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance.  And we all understand that very well; we’ve gone over it many, many times.  This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering.
A safe and phased reopening of our economy — it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way.  On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back.  We’re winning this, and we’re going to win it, and we’re going to keep watching.  We’re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy.
With each passing day, we’re learning more and more about this enemy.  The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces.  The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments.
I have to say that, very excitingly, we’re going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while.  It was a great report you gave.  And he’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight.  Wait until you hear the numbers.  You won’t even believe them.
U.S. trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK, and China.  That’s big news.  And we’re — a lot of trials are going on.  We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this, both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics.
We must be careful in all conditions, but we will — we will get this done.  We’re very close to a vaccine.  Unfortunately, we’re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time.  But we’ll get it done.
And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he’s going to be doing and what he’s going to be saying and the report that he’s about to give.  I think it’s going to be something that nobody has ever heard.  It’ll be brand-new information and very important information.
My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies.  We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days.  And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process.  Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask.  So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks.  And it’s working very well.
We just want the hospitals and the institutions, where it is, to use it.  A lot of people don’t use it.  They’re so used to getting a new mask, they don’t want to use it.  They want to go and immediately get a new one.  We’re asking them to use the sterilization process.  Every bit as good — up to 20 times.  Think of that.
In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch.  It’s really a military operation.
The Vice President is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by-county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection.  And this is equipment and things that are incredible.  It’s personal protective equipment.  It’s incredible, and it’s all brand new and at the highest level.  We’re getting only the highest level.  And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak.
This way, the governor should know exactly what’s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge.  We’re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state.  When we can’t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors.  And we’re getting them fast, and we’re notifying them very strongly so they know it’s there.  Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed.
Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation’s incredible county emergency management teams who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end, to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies, and save countless American lives.  We salute these heroic officials on the frontlines.
As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus.  The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick — and frankly, those that are very sick.  Nearly 3,000 patients are now enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, receiving transfusions nationwide.
And I want to thank all of the people that recovered, for what they’ve done.  They — as I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they’re saying, “I want to donate blood.  I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.”  It’s really quite incredible.
Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type.  This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high-risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place.  A very big deal.
Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks, and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution.  I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you’re doing, because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help.  And they’ve been so great, and I just appreciate it.
My administration has also partnered with leading — and we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence.
Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies.  And we’re collaborating with tech firms, universities, and our national labs to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines.  That search is going on, and it’s being — I think you’ll see in the future — you’ll see it’s very successful.  Ultimately, it’ll be a tremendous success.  Great progress is being made at a rapid pace — a pace like no other.
We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology, and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague, and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity.
Our country is going to do fantastically well.  You see what’s going on.  There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better, and that’s what’s going to happen.
So with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up — Vice President.  Say a few words please, Mike.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon.  Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met.  And while our hearts are with the families of those who have lost their life to the coronavirus and those who are struggling with serious illness today, our team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, informs us that the data continues to show promising signs of progress.
The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be past their peak.  And we are seeing consistent declines in hospitalization and cases in regions across the country.
Our only conclusion is that we’re getting there, America, because the American people have put into practice the President’s guidelines of social distancing because you’ve been listening and adhering to the guidance of state and local officials.  We are — we’re making — we’re making meaningful progress.  In a very real sense, sparing Americans to be exposed to the coronavirus and, no less extent, saving lives.
Our task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead — as states implement their policies, including phased reopening — that we’ll preserve those gains.  We do believe, by early summer, we could be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us.
Earlier today, we also had a conference call led by Secretary Ben Carson and leaders from HUD about the President’s announcement yesterday that he is repurposing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority communities.  Secretary Carson will convene the council tomorrow, and we’ll be reporting tomorrow afternoon on their progress.
We want to thank the more than 270 leaders of organizations dedicated to housing, homelessness, and improving the lives of people across our urban communities — not only for being with us today, for the way they have partnered with our administration and partnered with state and local officials to put the health of all of their constituencies first.
As the President mentioned, we’ll — you’ll receive a report that our task force received formally this week from Bill Bryan of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security.  He will outline, as the President said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer.
On the subject of testing: At the present moment, we have reports of 4.93 million tests having been performed across America.  And encouraging news: As states have been engaging commercial labs at a higher level across the country, yesterday our commercial lab system did more than 100,000 tests in a single day.  So we’re beginning to activate all of the capacity.
And tomorrow, at the President’s direction, our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation’s governors to talk about the progress that they are making on testing.  And we’re going to hear from governors about the practices that — and methods that they are employing to significantly increase testing following our briefing about capacity in laboratories this past Monday.
For instance, Governor Mike DeWine just announced that Ohio’s testing has been greatly expanded after the FDA approved Thermo Fisher’s new extraction reagent, saying, in his words, that the action, quote, “probably doubled, maybe even tripled testing in Ohio virtually overnight.”
Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota announced, along with the state’s healthcare system, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota, what he described as a breakthrough for rapid, widespread testing — able to test more than 20,000 people using a molecular test per day.
Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa launched the Test Iowa Initiative that will triple testing capacity by partnering with Nomi Health and DOMO.  She also worked with the University of Iowa Hospitals to leverage further capacity.
And Governor Eric Holcomb and Governor Andy Beshear, of Indiana and Kentucky respectively, both announced additional drive-through testing locations.
Our priority has always been to focus first on those impacted by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare workers ministering to their needs every day.  And I know, Mr. President, how proud you are that our men and women in uniform have come alongside our healthcare workers in communities most impacted, and I know the American people are proud as well.
As of today, FEMA reports that 35,000 National Guard have been deployed across the country to aid in our coronavirus response.  Governor Kevin Stitt of Ohio [Oklahoma] actually deployed the National Guard to hospitals across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it in to state emergency management and FEMA.
And Governor Greg Abbott of Texas actually mobilized more than 1,200 National Guard and 45 teams to provide greater access to testing.
Along with the National Guard, at the President’s direction today, more than 4,500 active duty military doctors, nurses, and medical assistants have been deployed across the country.  Yesterday, 1,013 medical professionals in our military were actually deployed to 19 hospitals in 7 states to support those amazing healthcare workers.
And with 4.4 million more Americans filing for unemployment in the past week, I joined the President in welcoming passage in the House today of the Paycheck Protection Program.  It’ll support working families.  It’ll allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for a period of two months.  But it also, as the President requested, included $75 billion to assist hospitals across the country.
And in that spirit, the President and I will continue to urge states across the country: Given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries, wherever possible — either statewide or on a county-by-county basis.  We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals and we’ll be working with states to enable that.
In that vein, Governor Doug Ducey exec- — issued an executive order not long ago, allowing elective surgeries beginning May 1 for hospitals that meet certain preparedness criteria.
And Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, is allowing elective clinical procedures to begin on April 21st.
Finally, Mr. President, the task force received today our first report on state reopening plans.  At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans.  Thirteen of those were actually released since you unveiled the Opening Up America Guidelines to our governors and to the nation last week.
And to your point, Mr. President, states are beginning to make those plans.  And we’re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that’s contemplated in our Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.
For instance, Governor Mike Parson of Missouri announced the “Show Me Strong” Recovery Plan as two initial phases intended to protect the most at-risk.
Governor Tom Wolf announced the Plan for Pennsylvania that would begin May 8th — will end a stay-at-home order for just portions of Pennsylvania.  But the plan, again, requires regions to have fewer than 50 new positive cases per 100,000 for a period of 14 days, and it also lays out a phased reopening roadmap.
Governor Kate Brown of Oregon updated their framework for reopening, doing three phases — again, on a county-by-county basis.
And Governor Brad Little of Idaho released “Rebound Idaho” in just the last few days that will consist of four phases and require specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen.
Mr.  President, with the — with the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, states are making plans.  And at your direction, our task force will continue to work very closely, providing them with the data, providing them with the resources to be able to implement those plans in a safe and responsible way.
So, with that, let me just end where I began, and to say thank you to the American people.  The progress that we are seeing is a testament to what all of you have done; to our extraordinary healthcare workers; to a partnership between the federal government and to state and local official.  And I’m confident it’s also owing to the prayers of millions of Americans each and every day.
All of that combined, we’re — we’re slowing the spread.  We’re protecting the most vulnerable.  We’re saving lives.  And every single day, we are one day closer to opening up America again.
With that, Mr. President, I’d be pleased to call Bill forward.  Bill Bryan leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security and now will make a presentation on their recent study.
ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:  Thank you, Mr.  Vice President.  Thank you, Mr.  President —
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bill.
ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: — for this opportunity to do this today.
Good afternoon everybody.  My name is Bill Bryan and I lead the Science and Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Over the last several months, we’ve intensified the Department’s R&D efforts to identify and deliver information that informs our response to COVID-19.  S&T is working to identify, develop, deploy, and deploy the tools and information to support our response to this crisis.
As part of our efforts, we’re leveraging the unique capabilities of S&T’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center to study the biology of the COVID-19 virus.  This center is a high-biocontainment laboratory located in Frederick, Maryland.  It was established in the early 2000s, in response to the Amerithrax attacks, and where we study, characterize, analyze, and develop countermeasures for biological threats to the homeland.  We work closely with the CDC, FDA, HHS, and also our Department of Defense colleagues and many others.
Yesterday, I shared the emerging results of our work that we’re doing now with the Coronavirus Task Force.  And today, I would like to share certain trends that we believe are important.
If I may have the first slide, please.  And while that’s coming up, our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus — both surfaces and in the air.  We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus.
So let me illustrate with this first slide.  If you look to the right, you’ll see that term “half-life,” with a bunch of timestamps on there.
First, let me tell you what a “half-life” is.  We don’t measure the virus as far as how long we live on the surface; we have to measure the decay of the virus in terms of its half-life, because we don’t know certain elements.  We don’t know how much a person expectorates when he — when he spits — right? — when he sneezes, whatever the case may be.  We don’t know how much virus is in there.  So it’s — that has a long — a bearing on how long the virus is going to be alive and active.  So we measure it in half life because half-life doesn’t change.
So if you look at an 18-hour half-life, what you’re basically saying is that every 18 hours, the virus — it’s the life of the virus is cut in half.  So if you start with 1,000 particles of the virus, in 18 hours, you’re down to 500.  And 18 hours after that, you’re down to 250, and so on and so forth.  That’s important, as I explain in the rest of the chart.
If you look at the first three lines, when you see the word “surface,” we’re talking about nonporous surfaces: door handles, stainless steel.  And if you look at the — as the temperature increases, as the humidity increases, with no sun involved, you can see how drastically the half-life goes down on that virus.  So the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace, just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity.
If you look at the fourth line, you inject summer — the sunlight into that.  You inject UV rays into that.  The same effects on line two — as 70 to 35 degrees with 80 percent humidity on the surface.  And look at line four, but now you inject the sun.  The half-life goes from six hours to two minutes.  That’s how much of an impact UV rays has on the virus.
The last two lines are aerosols.  What does it do in the air?  We have a very unique capability — I was discussing this with the President prior to coming out; he wanted me to convey it to you — on how we do this.  I believe we’re the only lab in the country that has this capability.
But if you can imagine a Home Depot bucket — a five-gallon Home Depot bucket — we’re able to take a particle — and this was developed and designed by our folks at the NBACC.  We’re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperatures, various humidity levels, multiple different kinds of environmental conditions, to include sunlight.  And we’re able to measure the decay of that virus while it’s suspended in the air.  This is how we do our aerosol testing.
We worked with John Hopkin Applied Physics Lab, and we actually developed a larger drum to do actually more testing.  And it’s four times the size of that.  So this is the capability that we bring to this effort.
So, in summary, within the conditions we’ve tested to date, the virus in droplets of saliva survives best in indoors and dry conditions.  The virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva.  And that’s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done, number one, with the COVID-19 virus, and number two, in saliva or respiratory fluids.
And thirdly, the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.  And when you — when you look at that chart, look at the aerosol as you breathe it; you put it in a room, 70 to 75 degrees, 20 percent humidity, low humidity, it lasts — the half-life is about an hour.  But you get outside, and it cuts down to a minute and a half.  A very significant difference when it gets hit with UV rays.
And, Mr. President, while there are many unknown links in the COVID-19 transmission chain, we believe these trends can support practical decision making to lower the risks associated with the virus.
If I can have my next slide.
And when that — while that comes up, you’ll see a number of some practical applications.  For example, increasing the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminated indoor spaces appears to reduce the stability of the virus.  And extra care may be warranted for dry environments that do not have exposure to solar light.
We’re also testing disinfectants readily available.  We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.  And I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that’s with no manipulation, no rubbing — just spraying it on and letting it go.  You rub it and it goes away even faster.  We’re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva.
This is not the end of our work as we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our findings into practical applications to mitigate exposure and transmission.  I would like to thank the President and thank the Vice President for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in addressing this pandemic.  I would also like to thank the scientists, not only in S&T and the NBACC, but to the larger scientific and R&D community.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bill.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-31/

6:10 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  A lot of tremendous things are happening.  The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide.  Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing.  The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what’s going on.  And they’re going down; they’re going in the right direction.  Cases in the Boston area are now declining.  The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific.  And Detroit is past its peak.
These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen.  It’s very exciting.  It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what’s happening.  And people are getting ready and they’re all excited.
I do want to mention a man who’s done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield.  He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus.  Totally misquoted.  I spoke to him.  He said it was ridiculous.  He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time.  And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we’ll take care of.  We’re going to knock it out.  We’ll knock it out fast.  But that’s what he was referring to: coming together at the same time.
And I think rather than waiting, I’d ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn’t say it was a big — a big explosion.  The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate.  The statement wasn’t bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is — as I say, that’s fake news.  And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew.  They were asked to change it, and they wouldn’t do that.  And it was false.
So I’ll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain.  Please.  Thank you, Doctor.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I really do think it’s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people.
When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of the fall, winter — next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time: influenza and the coronavirus-19.
But I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say.  I didn’t say that this was going to be worse.  I said it was going to be more complic- — or more difficult and potentially complicated because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.
I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation’s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to sustain the containment mode.  Those of you who heard me talk before, I’ve told you that in January and February — up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases.  We were in the containment mode.  And then, unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into this extreme mitigation.
We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter season so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring.
I have confidence that our public health response of early case recognition that we’ve talked about, isolation, and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective public health strategy so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode.
Again, that will be supported by the American public’s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate.
The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence.  One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.
Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-30/

5:46 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much everyone.  We had a very big day today.  I want to start by saying that our love and prayers of every American continue to be with our fellow citizens who have lost a cherished friend or a family member to the virus.
Amidst our grief, we’re making tremendous strides against this invisible enemy.  Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals, our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world.  And that’s due to a lot of — a lot of things, but our medical professionals have been incredible.
Since we announced our “Guidelines on Opening Up America,” as we call it — we say “Opening up America,” and we add the word agun [sic].  I think we can add the word, probably, “again.”  But that’s what it is: We’re opening up America again.
Twenty states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future.  So that’s 20 states; that’s about 40 percent of our country.  They’re moving along pretty quickly.  Three announced today, as you know, and they’re going to be doing it safely.  They’re going to be doing it with tremendous passion.  There’s — they want to get back to work.  The country wants to get back to work.
A short time ago, the Senate passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act, with additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, hospitals, and testing.  A lot of money for all of them, especially for our workers and our small businesses.
My administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical 482-billion-dollar funding package.  We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small-business support to keep workers on the payroll; $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid, and very badly — I’m very proud of that; and $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts.
I urge the House to pass the bill, and they’re going to be voting on it, I imagine, very — very soon.
I think while we’re here, and so he’s a very busy man, as you know — Secretary Mnuchin — he’s going to be running back, so I thought we’d do — we’ll talk about that now, and we’ll take a couple of questions on that.  And then he can go and start phase four, as the ink is drying.
Probably, they’ll be voting tomorrow in the House, but shortly.  Shortly.  And I think we have tremendous support.
So, Steve, please come up.  Say a few words.  Steve?  Yeah.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you for all your work with us to get this passed.  I’d especially like to thank Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and the entire Senate for passing this.  I’d also like to thank Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, who have been working with us around the clock as well, and our Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, who was also very instrumental in this.
Let me just comment.  We’ve had tremendous support for the PPP.  This gives us another $310 billion for the PPP.  We look forward to the House passing this tomorrow and being up and running quickly after that.
This also gives us $50 billion for disaster loans, EIDL loans.  That will allow the SBA to make $300 billion of disaster loans, all for small businesses.  It also allows us, as the President said, more money to hospitals and an unprecedented amount of money for testing.  And again, I think we understand hospitals — not only the hospitals that have been impacted by coronavirus, but more importantly, many hospitals that have been shut down, and making sure that the doctors and nurses get money.
Now, let me make just one more comment on the program.  We have over a million companies that have received this with less than 10 workers.  So there is very broad participation in really small business.  I will comment there have been some big businesses that have taken these loans.  I was pleased to see that Shake Shack returned the money.  We will be putting out some FAQs.  There is a certification that people are making.
And I asked people — just make sure: The intent of this was for business that needed the money.  We’ll put out an FAQ.  But again, the intent of this money was not for big public companies that have access to capital.
THE PRESIDENT:  And not for Harvard, you might say, Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-3/

5:39 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everyone.  Thank you.  Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence; we’re going to have a resurgence, too.  At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion.
During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody has become very familiar with.
We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.  For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially.  You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30 percent, 25 percent.  In Detroit, as an example, it’s down by over 50 percent.  Congratulations.  And, in New Orleans, where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65 percent.
Thirty states have just one case or less per 1,000 people — far fewer cases per capita, as an example, than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.
My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs.  We hope to have an agreement very soon.  And hopefully tomorrow, the Senate is going to be able to vote.  A lot of progress has been made on that — tremendous progress.  It’s a great plan.  It’s a great plan.  It’s helped a lot of people.  So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate.
And based on the record-low price of oil that you’ve been seeing — it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people — we’re filling up our National Petroleum Reserves.  Strategic — you know, the Strategic Reserves.  And we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves.  That would top it out.  That would be first time in a long time it’s been topped out.  We’d get it for the right price.
We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional $75 billion — our deal; the deal we’re talking about — $75 billion for hospitals and other healthcare providers.  Many providers and their employees have taken a huge financial hit in recent weeks.  And visits, elective procedures, surgeries, et cetera, et cetera, were canceled.  We think that they can all get back online.  They’ll get it done.  The hospitals have really been fantastic.  The hospitals, they’ve — they’ve stepped up to the plate.  They’ve really done a great job.  We appreciate it so much.
For areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments.  HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country.  We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African American and Hispanic American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need.
Earlier today, Vice President Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus.  He had a great call.  It was a great call — very positive in, I’d say, every way.  Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states — many, many labs.  We’re providing you with the list.  We’ll show it to you now if you need it.  We’ll give you the details.  But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able.
Some of the governors, like, as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list.  He didn’t understand too much about what was going on.  So now I think he’ll be able to do that.  It’s pretty simple.  But they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out.  We’ll work with him and work with all of the governors.
Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity.  Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand.  And it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it.  The governor, as an example, Pritzker from Illinois did not understand his capacity.  Not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support — I mean, you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing.  And they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up.  And you’ll be seeing that; we’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it.
I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomo’s remarks during his press conference today.  He said: The President is right.  The states’ testing is up to the states to do, which will implement the test and logistically coordinate the tests.  We have about 300 labs in New York and they do it.  And they’re great labs, actually.  And it’s my job to coordinate those 300 labs.  I think the President is right when he says that the states should lead.
And the governor is really — they’re really getting — they’re getting it together in New York.  A lot of good things are happening in New York.  And I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow.  He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon.  Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people.  So we look forward to that.
The — some of the articles that just recently came about — if you remember, I put out a statement today.  For a month, it was all “ventilator, ventilator, ventilator.”  That’s all people could talk about was ventilators.  And we did a great job with that.  We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly.  We have so many now that, at some point soon, we’re going to be helping Mexico and Italy and other countries.  We’ll be sending them ventilators, which they desperately need.  They were a position — they were not in a position to build them themselves.
But we have thousands being built.  Every state has had — they have the ventilators.  If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our Federal Reserve — our “stockpile,” as they call it.  And we did a great job with the ventilators.
Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it — other than the fair press.  But — so then you say, “Gee, I — they need ventilators.”  We don’t need ventilators.  And that’s — that’s under pressure we did that.
Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one.  And a story that just came out: “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story.”  I’m sure you love to see that.  That’s by Rich Lowry, a respected journalist and person.  “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story” — which, unfortunately, you did.
And here’s another one that just came out.  Kyle Smith.  “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t.”  “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t” — because we got it fixed.  And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators.  So if a thing like this should happen again, they’ve got them.
The stories on testing are all over the place — that we’re actually in good shape.  I’m going to have the Vice President and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time.  You’re going to see some interesting things.
I thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who has done an incredible job, tell you where we are.  You know we’re still building beds and hospitals for people that need them.  I guess the hospital business generally is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re — we’re creating a lot of space for people, just in case.  And in some cases, they probably will be using them.
But I thought the general — he’s been so impressive and done such a great job.  I thought, on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government, he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now.
Thank you very much.  General.
LIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:  Well, thank you, Mr.  President.  I just want you to know that, on behalf of all of us in the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those patients and all those victims that have been affected by this terrible virus.
And the President of Vice President talk all the time about the heroes, but when I’ve been out there, I’ve seen the doctors, I’ve seen the nurses, and all those that have worked very, very hard, and we’re just — we’re just so proud to be part of this noble calling.
I — for my team, I really made it very, very simple.  I said there’s three legs of this stool, and they all have “S’s”: There are “sites” — in other words, hospitals; we’ve got to worry about “supplies”; and we’ve got to worry about “staff.”
And so, right when Governor Cuomo called the President, about almost 30 days ago, he said, “I need some help” — worrying about what could be tens of thousands of hotel room — I mean, of hospital room shortages.
So the President and Secretary of Defense asked us to fly to Albany with a team.  And on the way up, we understood how complex of a challenge this was, and we knew there was no way you can solve a complex catastrophe with a complicated solution.  We needed a very, very simple solution to be able to then work with HHS, to be able to work with FEMA, to be able to work with the Vice President’s task force, and then to be able to power this down all the way down to the local level.
Some of the governors asked us to try to build a hospital in a parking lot or a field in two or three weeks.  You can’t physically do that.  So what we said was, “Let’s go to where there’s an existing facility.”  And I’m going to kind of make this in two big pots: those that are either hotel rooms or college dormitories, smaller rooms — or those that are in real large areas, like field houses or convention centers.
And we designed those standard facilities that could be either non-COVID or COVID, and then we got that approved here at the federal government to be able to then power that back down.
So we went to Governor Cuomo, and he said, right up front, “I love the concept.  I need you in the Javits Center.  I’m ready to start having you work tomorrow afternoon.”
So when we flew back that afternoon, the next day, we basically built this standard design and then continued to be able to power it down, all the way down through the rest of the team.
So I just want to show you a couple of slides here.  And we’ll — we’ll kind of let you know where we’re at right now, Mr President.
We had to do a bunch of assessments, so somewhere in the order of over 1,100 different locations we went to.  And we work for FEMA, and we work for the President, and we work for governors and mayors.  And we said, “What do you think your demand is going to be?”  And based on a lot of the modeling that’s been in this room here, we were able to understand when the peak curve was, but we also were able to understand where’s the bed shortage.
So then, these 1,100 facilities — right now today, sir, we’re actually executing 32 different facilities.  That’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds.  Eight of those are all done.  We’ve still got a lot more to complete.  And in the next week and a half, we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities.
We’ve got some pending.  Some mayors and governors are still wondering do they have enough bed space.  And what’s important here is we need a very agile plan.  You can’t do something three weeks ago and think that this is going to continue to stay, because this virus gets a vote.  And this entire team — the federal government has tried to be as agile as they can, supporting those states and those governors.
The beauty of the plan, though, was it doesn’t have to be built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  So we designed about an extra 52 facilities.  We gave those to the governors.  And I’ve got to be very, very laudatory to the governors.  They then imposed and put a lot of those on the — on the ground and did those themselves.
So let’s go to — I’m just going to show you some real simple pictures here.  Go to the next slide, if you don’t mind.
So this is an example of the Javits Center, and you heard the President talk about it quite a few times.  This one, about 2,100 bed spaces.  What you get is about an 11- or 12-foot-square cubicle.  There is lights in there.  There’s a nurse call, so if you need to be able to call the nurse station.  There are nurse spaces throughout.  There’s pharmacies throughout.  This one started as non-COVID, but then we came back in and put in central oxygen.  So everybody has oxygen right behind their bed to be able to take care of those patients.  And again built this one, and about 1,000 patients treated.
Let’s go to the next one.
I was up in Detroit with Governor Whitmer, and she walked us through and told us her intent.  Here’s what — she needed to do this in the TCF Center.  You’ll see all the cubicles that are laid out.  This is right in the middle of a convention floor where there might be like a boat show or a car show, and then we went in and we built 970 different capabilities there.
And again, a lot of great work by my guys in the Corps of Engineers and the rest of the mayors in the cities’ team all pulling together.
Let’s go to the next one.
This is called the McCormick Place.  Governor Pritzker sat us down.  He said, “Here’s, kind of, our intent on what you want to do.”  Mayor Lightfoot walked us through, and we went into another large convention center.  This is actually 3,000 bed spaces.  This was a very, very large build.  And got this one done in a relatively short time.
And then here’s another one that kind of helps you understand the dynamic here.  Go to the next one, please.
This is in Miami Beach, and I flew in to see Governor DeSantis.  And my guys had kind of scoped out about 450 beds, and he said, “Todd, how long is it going to take to build this?”  And we kind of said, “Probably until the 27th of April.”  And he went to his health people and he said, “How long do you need?”  And he said, “The day we need this is the 21st of April.”  And I told my guys, “You don’t have until the 27th.  Figure out how to get it done by the 20th.”
This is where you don’t get to build to be able to have the perfect solution.  You got to be able to get the mission essential done.  Lives are on the line here, and we’ve got to be able to get everything done to be able to save those lives.
And let’s go to the last one here.  This is one we’re doing right now: Colorado.  This is in Denver, in another gigantic convention center.  You’ll see all the different cubicles here to be able to just bring in that oxygen.  Six-inch copper pipe that comes in, and it’s all piped throughout the entire convention center.  Six miles of pipe that’s able to go in to be able to make that happen.
And in closing, I just want to be able to say that we are very, very focused in the Corps of Engineers on getting this done, but this is all about the team — the federal team, the state team, the local team.  The Vice President and his task force, and on a lot of the people sitting here, have informed us of how fast we need to go.  And it goes back to, again, all the governors and the mayors to make this happen.
But I want to reiterate: President Trump has called me three times, and Secretary Esper has been on the phone at least one of those times, and said, “What else do we need to do to set you up for success?  Is there any other knobs we can turn to be able to help you go?”  And you think about that equation of those three “S’s.”  I think that with the federal government and the mayors in the cities here, we’ve effectively taken that first “S” out of the equation.
And, sir, I can’t tell you, of all the things I’ve done in my career, this is a noble calling to be able to step up and save American lives.
So, with that, sir, I thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.  Thank you very much.  Anybody have a question for the general while he’s here?  Anybody?  Because I think he’s very self-explanatory.  He’s done an incredible job.
Jeff, do you have a question?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-29/

6:28 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I’d like to begin by saying that we’re continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of.  I think we — we’re getting close to a deal.  It could happen.  It could happen.  A lot of good work has been going on, and we could have an answer tomorrow.  And we’re going to see what — what exactly does take place.
We’re also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals, who have been hurt very badly.  The rural hospitals, for a long time, have not been treated properly.  We’re looking to help them, and beyond.  So we’re looking at hospitals also, as part of the package.  And we’ll see how that all comes out.
But a lot of good things are happening.  Some very good negotiations.  I just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury, and we have some very good negotiations going on right now.  And I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow, but we’ll see.
America continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus.  As of today, we’ve tested 4.18 million Americans.  That’s a record anywhere in the world.  The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada.
And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people.  So we’ve — we’ve done more testing than all of these countries combined: France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, and Australia, Sweden, and Canada.  That’s something.  Right?
We’re doing a great job.  We’re — we are.  This team is an incredible team, and that includes Army Corps of Engineers, a lot of our military people, our admirals, our generals.  Got one of our great admirals here, who’s done an incredible job.  You haven’t slept too much in the last two months either.  Look at him.  (Laughs.)
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  No, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s — somebody said to me, “President, you look tired.”  I said, “I should be tired.”  We should all be tired.  But we have to win, right?
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Tomorrow, the President — the Vice President will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters, Mike —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  — to review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies.  Working very hard with governors now on testing.  We want to help them out.
Before the call, we’ll send them a full list of all of the large laboratory machines in the states.  They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there, and they’re really high-quality machines, by the way.  And the potential capacity of those machines, if they’re fully utilized — a couple of them didn’t know that they could be utilized in a different manner.  They’re only up to 10 percent, and they can go 90 percent more.
Many governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them.  As an example, commercial laboratories, such as Quest and LabCorp — these are massive laboratories that can handle a lot more than they’re being sent.  A few days ago, it was at 30 percent.  They’re only at 30 percent capacity now.  I don’t know — probably the same, but they have a lot of capacity.
In addition, academic laboratories, big research labs — there’s tremendous capacity out there.  And some of them want the fast — you know, the instant Abbott machine, which just came about due to the research during this little short period of time.  And it’s very quick, but these labs can do them very quickly also, and they’re — they’re massive.  They can handle much more — much more than the machine, the small machine, can handle.
We continue to procure millions of swabs, test collectors.  I have something here.  Just happen to have it.  It’s a swab.  It looks innocent.  Not very complicated.  Anybody like to see what it looks like?  Should I open it?  Does everybody?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-28/

5:09 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Good afternoon.  We continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak.  It’s been very devastating all over the world.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.  Probably more.  That number was as of a week ago.
Dr. Birx will walk through some of these trends in a few moments, but they’re very positive trends for winning.  Going to win.  We’re going to close it out.
While we mourn the tragic loss of life — and you can’t mourn it any stronger than we’re mourning it — the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country, with the possible exception of Germany.  And I think we’re as good or better.
On a per capita basis — remember that: On a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of Western Europe, with the lone exception of possibly Germany.  This includes the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France.  Spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the United States, but you don’t hear that.  You hear we have more death.  But we’re much bigger countries than any of those countries by far.
So when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the United States is number one — but we’re not number one; China is number one, just so you understand.  China is number one by a lot.  It’s not even close.  They’re way ahead of us in terms of death.  It’s not even close.  You know it.  I know it.  And they know it.  But you don’t want to report it.  Why?  You’ll have to explain that.  Someday I’ll explain it.
Since we released the guidelines to open up America again — and this was two days ago — a number of states, led by both Democrat and Republican governors, have announced concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual, and phased opening.
Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions.  And I can tell you the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he knows what he’s doing.  He’s a great governor.  He knows exactly what he’s doing.
Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.  Ohio, North Dakota, and Idaho have advised non-essential businesses to prepare for a phased opening starting May 1st.
Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken unprecedented actions to rush economic relief to our citizens.  As an example, you don’t hear anymore about ventilators.  What happened to the ventilators?  And now they’re giving you the other; it’s called “testing.”  Testing.  But they don’t want to use all of the capacity that we’ve created.  We have tremendous capacity.  Dr. Birx will be explaining that.  They know that.  The governors know that.  The Democrat governors know that; they’re the ones that are complaining.
Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve already processed nearly $350 billion to 1.6 million small businesses across the nation to keep American workers on the payroll.  So we’re asking the Democrats to get it done.  This should be bipartisan.  This should be 100 percent vote.  And it’s really been incredible.  The $350 billion that’s been approved is so popular, and it’s keeping businesses open.  It’ll be open hopefully forever.
Our swift action is directly supporting 30 million American jobs.  Amy Wright, from North Carolina, as an example, said the program is a “game changer” for her and her family.  It’s coffee shops.  And she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities.  And now they’re all staying, and they’re getting paid.  And she’s got a dream, and it’s going to take place very quickly when she opens again.  So, Amy, good luck.  North Carolina — great place.
Scott and Julie Alderink helped lead a church and own a restaurant in South Dakota, with about 15 employees.  They were already starting layoffs.  Layoffs were moving along rapidly.  But now they’ve hired their employees back, and they can keep the restaurant open.  And it’ll be moving quickly — very quickly — as opposed to not having anybody and probably not having a place to have all of these people employed.  She would have been out of business.  She would have been done.
The Paycheck Protection Program funding is now fully drained.  It’s out.  It’s gone.  Three hundred and fifty billion dollars to small businesses.  And, in turn, it goes to the employees of those small businesses.
Lawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay.  The Democrats have to come onboard.  I used to read that these were Democrat programs, not Republican.  It seems to have switched around a lot, hasn’t it?  Huh?  Switched around a lot.  The republicans want it.  I think the Democrats probably do too.
But they also want other things that are unacceptable.  This is about COVID.  This is about the plague and what it’s done to us.  This isn’t about extraneous things that they’ve been trying to get for years and that our country doesn’t want them to have.
As we enter the next stage of our battle, we are continuing our relentless effort to destroy the virus.  My administration is taking steps to protect high-risk communities by providing funding for 13,000 community health center sites and mobile medical stations.
In order to equip them with the most advanced and robust testing capabilities, these sites are incredible.  What they can do is incredible.  The job they do is incredible.  These centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions, including many African American and Hispanic communities.  We’re taking care of them.  And it’s so important, because you’ve all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on African American, and you’re reading a little bit less about Hispanic, but likewise Hispanic communities.  The numbers are disproportionate.  In fact, we’re doing big studies on it right now.  We don’t like it.  Not right.
Nationwide, we’ve now conducted over 4 million tests, and Deborah will be talking about that.  It’s double the number conducted by any other country on Earth.  So that’s more than two times, actually, the number conducted by any other country on Earth.  You hear so much about testing.  What we’ve done is incredible on testing.  And I started with an obsolete, broken system from a previous administration — or administrations.  But I would really say “administration” for a different reason because testing has become so advanced over the last number of years, and we have the most advanced of all.
I spoke with other nations this morning — the leaders — and they all are talking about our great testing capability, and some of them want to know what to do; what — how can they get involved, because they need it for their own countries.
In Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and other hotspots, we have also tested more people per capita, by far, than Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, and all other major countries.  So think of that.  In New York, for instance, per capita testing is 6 percent higher than in Singapore.  In fact, there’s a typo.  It’s 67 percent higher.  That’s a big difference.
I’d say there’s a big difference between six percent and sixty- — I was looking; I said, 6 percent doesn’t look too good.  It’s 67 percent — good job out there — higher than Singapore; 64 higher than South Korea; and 47 percent higher than Australia.  So it’s 67 percent higher than Singapore, which is a very advanced place in terms of what they’re doing.
My administration has also been speaking frequently with many of the governors to help them find and unlock the vast unused testing capacity that exists in their states.  Dr. Birx discussed yesterday the commercial and academic laboratories, and the states have tremendous unused capability, which they can use.  The governors should use it.  Tremendous unused capability, and they’re waiting for business from these governors that — some of them complain.  I must tell you, for the most part, we’re getting along great with them, but some of them like to complain.
But I still go back because the hardest thing of all, by far, by a factor of 20, is the ventilators.  And now we’re the king of ventilators.  We have ventilators.
We’re going to be helping other countries very soon.  We’re going to be helping Mexico.  I spoke with the President of Mexico.  He’s great.  A great guy.  And I told him we’re going to be helping him.  They desperately, in Mexico, need ventilators, and I told him we’re going to be helping him very substantially.  We’re in a position to do that.  We’re building, now, thousands a week.  And they’re coming in rapidly, and they’re very, very high quality.
But we’re also helping governors to develop strategies to smartly deploy their testing capacity to protect vulnerable and underserved populations, while getting Americans at lower risk safely back to work.
So, again, we have tremendous testing capacity.  Now, a lot of people like the Abbott test that we came up with.  Abbott is a brand-new technology, brand-new test.  It’s great.  It’s five minutes, boom, you put it in.  And we’re making thousands of machines.  Abbott is making thousands and thousands of machines.  But not everybody is going to get that one, but they’re going to get others.  We have numerous platforms which we’ll talk about in a minute.
Unfortunately, some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing, which they shouldn’t be doing, because I inherited broken junk.  Just as they did with ventilators where we had virtually none, and the hospitals were empty.  For the most part, the hospitals didn’t have ventilators.  We had to take care of the whole country, and we did a job, the likes of which nobody — we assembled an army of young, brilliant people.  For the most part, young; a couple of older ones.  But for the most part, they were young, brilliant geniuses that did a job like nobody would believe.  I wish you could have seen it.  Around the clock.
And now the rest of the world is coming to us, asking if we could help them with ventilators because they’re very complicated, very expensive.  They’re very hard to build.  And we have them coming in by the thousands.  But you don’t hear that from even the governors.  Nobody is complaining about ventilators.  And if there was a surge, we could have ventilators to them within hours, because we have in stockpile almost 10,000 ventilators.
You don’t hear about hospital beds.  When I first started, everyone was talking, “Oh, hospitals beds.  Hospitals beds.”   The governor of New York correctly asked me for hospital beds, and we got the Army Corps of Engineers out, and they built them.  He needed them.  I mean, he — we went — I know he said that we were projecting.  We’re not projecting New York.  We’re listening to the governors.  He wanted them.  He needed them.  And we gave him thousands of beds in Javits Center.  We brought the ship.  And then the ship, we had it converted to COVID-19.  And that was a big deal, by the way, because of ventilation and all the things we had to do.  But we did.
And fortunately for him — and for us, all of us — they haven’t used either one very much because the numbers have gone down significantly.  But it was there, and it was built, and it was beautiful.  Two thousand nine hundred beds.  It was incredible what they did.  They did it in a matter of a few days.
But, unfortunately — and it was very good; the relationship was very good.  And I’m, frankly, glad they don’t need them, but they were there.  Louisiana, the same thing.  I think the governor — a Democrat, good guy — and he will, I think, tell you a story that we had more than enough, and I said, “Well, we’re supposed to build one more.”  I called him and I said, “You know, if we don’t have to build this hospital” — it was an additional anywhere from 500 to 1,000 beds.  “If you don’t need it, would it be possible that we don’t build it?  We’d like to build it someplace else, or not build it at all and save money,” which is okay for government to use it someplace else.  And he called call me back the next day and he said, “Sir, we don’t need it.”  I said, “That’s great that you say that.  I appreciate it.”  And he didn’t need it.
But we were ready to go, and we took good care of Louisiana.  We took good care of Michigan.  We took good care of every place.  We didn’t — we didn’t miss a trick.
And we’re in great shape on testing.  We have different platforms.  We actually have nine different platforms.  And on Monday, we’re going to be adding one; that’ll be 9 to 10.  I don’t like to count on them before they’re up, but we’ll have anywhere from 9 to 10 platforms with a tremendous testing capability.  And people can go, and especially with phase one.
Now, at the same time — just like with ventilators — we’re building now the best ventilators.  Just like with ventilators, our testing is getting better and better.  I took the first test.  The first test was not pleasant.  This was not a pleasant thing.  I said, “You got to be kidding” to the doctor.  “You got to be kidding.”  Up your nose and then we hang a right, and it goes down here.  And then we’ll wiggle it around here, under your eye.  And then we’ll pull it out and we’ll say — I said, “No, that’s — there’s no way that can happen.  Is that the way it goes?  You sure?”  This was a very unpleasant test.
And then I was tested a few weeks later with the new test that just came out, the Abbott, where they just touch your nose, basically.  And they put it in a machine, and literally, a few minutes later, they tell you if you’re fine.  And I was lucky in both cases, because I’ve seen the damage that this does to people.
But we have great tests.  They’ve really gotten better and better and better as we go along.  But we have a tremendous lab capability — laboratory capability all over the country.  And for some reason, the governors, they’re not — a lot of them are, but some of the governors like to complain, and they’re not using it.  We have tremendous capability.  We’re ready for them.
And, as we go along, just like with ventilators, we’ll get better, more advanced, and, you know, it’ll be — we’ll be able to do things that nobody would have even believed possible.  But we started off with a broken system.  We inherited a broken, terrible system.
And I always say it: Our cupboards were bare.  We had very little in our stockpile.  Now we’re loaded up.  And we also loaded up these hospitals.  And, you know, we’re talking about payment.  We gave billions of dollars’ worth of things to hospitals, and we’ll have to work that out at some point.  In fact, I guess they’re going to be working that out with Congress.
But we loaded up hospitals.  The federal government loaded up hospitals with things to take care of people that are very desperately — we’re not — we weren’t worried about payment at that time.  We said, “You’ll take care of it at the right time.”
But we gave billions and billions and billions of dollars’ worth of medical goods and medicines and equipment to hospitals.  And we’ll — we’ll work it out with them.  But people don’t like to talk about that.
So we have done a job that nobody believed — this was a military and private enterprises march.  We marched — and, unfortunately, with the other side, because they’re viewing it as an election.  “How did President Trump do?”  “Oh, he did, uh, terribly.  Let’s see.  He did — uh, yeah, he did terribly.”  “Oh.”  But we just got them the ventilators that they didn’t have, that they should have had.  We just got them hospital beds by the thousands.  We just got them testing that they don’t even know how to use.  In some cases, they have machines that they’re only using 5 percent and 10 percent of the machine, because they have an advanced machine and they don’t know how to use it.  It can use — it can do much more.  So we’ve had people explain how to use it.
So, I don’t know, I don’t think I do that on the other side.  I don’t — I really don’t.  I think that here we have a crisis that we have to work together, and I hope we’re going to work together.  But we’re moving along, and we’re moving along well.  We’re moving along well.
This should not be a partisan witch hunt — you know? — like the Russia hunt that turned out to be a total phony deal.  Unfortunately, some of these voices, though, are attempting to — to bring this into politics.  And whether it’s testing or ventilators or hospital beds, or other dimensions of our sweeping public health response — we have had a sweeping response.
In speaking to the leaders of other countries this morning, they said, “This is incredible the way you’ve done this so quickly.”  You know, we’re only talking about a few weeks since everybody knew this was such a big problem.  And the rest of the world is watching, and they respect what we’ve done because I don’t think anybody else — I know nobody else could have done what we’ve done.  And we started with garbage.
As our experts said yesterday, America’s testing capability and capacity is fully sufficient to begin opening up the country, totally.  Indeed, our system is by far the most robust and advanced anywhere in the world, by far.  The rest of the world will tell you that.
I spoke this morning to a friend of mine, President Moon of South Korea.  He just won the election.  He won it by a lot.  He had a big victory, which I was happy about.  And he was saying what a great job we’ve done in this country.  I told him the same thing.  He said what a great job we’ve done here in this country.  So I appreciated that.  He had a great — by the way, he had a great victory and we’re very happy about that, from the standpoint of our country.  We’re working very well with them — South Korea.
As we approach — and the approach that we use — but as we approach, hopefully, the downward side of what’s going on, I think you’re going to see some incredible hard facts and evidence that what we did was right.  There’s a lot of talk about herd — the word “herd.”  I don’t want to show you charts of people that went a different way, but it’s scary.  It’s scary.
We would have had, I think, millions of people die had we done a different way.  And I think numbers are just coming out where they’re estimating 60,000 people will die.  That’s horrible.  I always say one person is too much, especially in this case, when it could have been stopped in China.  It could have been stopped in China, before it started, and it wasn’t.  And the whole world is suffering because of it.
But this herd concept — and everybody had to think of it at the beginning, because, look — look at us: We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.  Better than China; better than any country in the world; better than any country has ever had.  We had the highest stock market in history, by far.  And I’m honored by the fact that it has started to go up very substantially.  That’s because the market is smart.  The market is actually brilliant.  I’ve seen it.  And they’re viewing it like we’ve done a good job.  They view it that way.
Because if you would have told me that we’re at 24,000 or beyond, and the highest we were ever was — we never hit 30.  We were getting close to 30, so let’s say around 29,000.  We’re at 24.  If we were heading down, I would start to say, “Oh, wow, we may be heading into territory where I started.”  I didn’t like that.  Now we’re way up.  But if you would have said to me with what we’ve gone through — not caused by our country or our people or any — I mean, not caused by certainly anybody within our country.  But if you would have said that, after going through this horrible plague, that we’d have a stock market that’s much, much higher than when I started, much higher than where I started — and I think it’s — you know, I think we have tremendous momentum.  We have a big election coming up, but I think we have tremendous momentum.
First, we get rid of the plague.  And because of what we’re doing with the PPP, what we’re doing with the Paycheck, as we call it, I think we have a chance to have these companies get back to action quickly.
But our approach to testing is based on facts, data, and very hard evidence, not partisan agendas or coordinated political talking points.
Mike Pence, who’s a phenomenal guy, he’s making the commencement address right now at the Air Force Academy, where they’re being very politically correct.  Everyone is standing not 6 feet but 10 feet apart.  Okay?  And it’s very different.  I made that speech last year.  I’m going to West Point.  I think they’re changing the date to June 13th because of what’s going on in New York.  They’re moving into June 13th.  West Point.
So I’m doing their commencement speech, and they’re going to have — it’s sad because — but it’s a big start — they’re going to have the cadets.  They may not have the parents, but they’re going to have the cadets.  The parents are so proud of them.  I know at the Air Force Academy, where Mike is speaking right now, they don’t have the parents; they have the cadets.  They’re very, very widespread.
And you talk about social distancing — I mean, they are really spread.  I looked at it.  They using 10 feet.  So he’s — he’s doing that.  But they’re having it.  It’s very important to have it.  And that’s a great thing.  That’s a great thing.  That’s a big start.
So he’s there right now.  And I will tell you, they — he’s a gentleman, Mike Pence.  A real gentleman.  And they requested — the Democrat senators requested a phone call with him yesterday.  And I think they had, for the most part, all of them on — like, approximately 47.  I heard it was just about all of them, whatever it might be.  I don’t want to be wrong by 1 or 2 or 10 and have the press say, “He lied.  He told a lie.  Terrible, terrible.”  Whatever it was.  But they have 47, and I guess most of them were on.
I heard they were so rude.  I used a term today — I said, rude and nasty.  But I heard they were so rude.  No matter what he said, which was all very positive in terms of winning this battle against the invisible enemy — no matter what he said, they were fresh.  They were nasty.
And it was, I heard, just a terrible thing.  And I said, “Mike, that’s politics.  That’s what it is.”  If we came into this room today and said, “The battle is over.  We have won.  It’s 100 percent gone.”  The Democrats would say, “The President has done a horrible job.  He has done a disgraceful job.  It is a shame how bad he is.”
You know, it’s — it’s — this is the talking points; this is political.  And it would be nice not to have that, especially when we’ve done the job we’ve done.  I mean, all you have to do is look at the big — the big “V” for victory or “V” for ventilator.  Take a look at it.  Everybody said they had us on that; they had us.  They thought they had us, but we got them done at numbers that nobody would have believed.
And we did use our Act, our Production Act, and we used it.  But didn’t use it — we didn’t need it like a hammer.  All we had to do — for the most part — we used it, actually, in a number of cases.  But for the most part, all we had to do is talk about it.  All we had to do is say, “We’re going to use it if you don’t do this.”  And everybody was, you know, for the most part, good.  We used it a couple of times because it didn’t work out the easy way, but it worked out the hard way.
But whether it was masks or ventilator, it was incredible what we’ve been able to do.  So this is a very critical time for the American people, and the American people deserve real information, and responsible and thoughtful dialogue from their elected leaders and from the media.
The media has been — some very honest, but some very dishonest.  You know that.  You know that.  I mean, I even read a story where Mark Meadows — a tough guy — he was crying; he was crying.  This was a Maggie Haberman.  You know, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of Russia, but she was wrong on Russia.  So was everyone else.  They should all give back their Pulitzer Prizes.
In fact, it turned out that the crime was committed by the other side.  The crime was not committed by this side; it was committed by the other side — a bunch of bad people.  You saw the reports coming out over the last two weeks.  They got caught.  So Maggie Haberman gets a Pulitzer Prize?  She’s a third-rate reporter.  New York Times.
And we put her name up here last week.  You saw that.  People thought it was a commercial.  It wasn’t a commercial.  It was like a commercial, but it wasn’t a commercial.  It was just clips.  And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said Mark Meadows was crying.  And they made it sound — I said, “Mark” — and it’s okay if he did.  I wouldn’t — you know, look.  But I think he was crying probably — really, for the wrong reason they had it down.  But he’s not a crier.  And if he was — I know criers.  I could tell you people that you know that are very famous.  They cry, and that’s okay too.
But it was a nasty story in so many ways.  It was fake news.  And she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter.  She is.  I’ve known her for a long while.  I haven’t spoken to her in a long time.  I made the mistake: I take a picture with her at the desk, a long time ago.  Every time she does a story, if I say — I haven’t spoken to her in long — many, many, many months, maybe years.  I don’t speak to her.  She’s fake.  A lot of people are fake.  A lot of people  We got a lot of fake people.
But what happens is she writes this story as retribution.  Puts it in the New York Times.  And the New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper.  It’s my opinion.  It’s not an opinion.  It’s actually, from my standpoint — you know, the very hard thing to figure, though: Most people wouldn’t know that, but I know it because I know the facts.
And they make up — I said it today; they make up words.  “Sources say…” Most often used: “Sources say…”  You know what “sources say” means?  “Sources say” means they have nobody.  And they make it up.  Okay?
And they have a few other type statements that mean the same thing.  But “sources say” is the most often-used express- — in the Washington Post; New York Times, especially; CNN — fake news.  CNN.
They should really be mandated, and I mean mandated to use a name.  If there’s a source, use a name.  Say that Kayleigh — “Kayleigh McEnany said…” or somebody.  And you’d find out that the — number one, the source wouldn’t say it.  The sources don’t exist.  I don’t believe the sources exist.
And I try and tell this — you know, the beautiful thing about doing these conferences is that we have tremendous numbers of viewers, and I’m able to reach the viewers without having to go through fake news, where they make a good story into a bad story.
So, with all of that, it’s been an incredible period of time.  We’ve done a fantastic job.  We’re the talk of other nations.  The leaders of other nations are calling us for help.  They’re calling us for equipment.  They’re calling us for testing capacities.
Now, with the testing, we are going further.  Deborah is going to talk about that now.  With the testing, we have some other tests coming up that are going to be, I think, phenomenal.  I think they’re going to blow away everything as soon as they come out, and we’re going to get them out as soon as possible.
But I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words about where we’ve come, how far we’ve come, and more importantly, where we’re going from this point.  Because honestly, it’s — it’s quite amazing.  Thank you very much.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  If we could have the first slide.
I wanted to give you an update on where we are as states and as counties and as cities.  I know you all are watching carefully.  The numbers have shifted over the last few days.  What happens when nations — when states change the reporting from “confirmed” to “probable”?  So now all probable cases are included.  They had to add them back in.  Even though the cases may have been from March, they were added over 14, 15, and 16th of April, and states may continue to be adding them.  Eventually, we’re hoping that those get accounted for on the day when the presumptive cases or the probable cases were counted.  But right now, they’re added in, in one fell swoop.
So this is New York and New Jersey, and I think we all know how difficult and what a difficult time both New York and New Jersey have had.  I call your attention to the axis; it goes up to 250,000 cases.  So you can get a frame of how we’re talking about some of the other metro areas.
Next slide.
This is the 25 metro areas — the top 25 metro areas.  And you can only see the New York metro area in this slide.  Again, the axis goes up to about 300,000.  It includes the New Jersey part of the metro area, as well as part of southern Connecticut.
Next slide.
But if I take New York out — and the reason I wanted to do that — now the axis is one-tenth of the previous axis.  So that previous ax- — the previous slide, 300,000.  This slide, 30,000.  So that will give you a frame of reference for some of these other metros.
The reason I wanted to show you this is this is cumulative cases.  And we are still tracking, very closely, the issues in Chicago and Boston.  But on this slide, I hope you can see the yellow line; that is Detroit.  And Detroit and this mayor of Detroit has really done an extraordinary job, and the people of Detroit have done an extraordinary job with their social distancing.
The other line I want to call your attention to is the line here.  This is New Orleans.  And I think — frankly, I was concerned about New Orleans because they had a lot of preexisting comorbidities.  They only — they have two or three major hospitals, but a large cover, a very large area of geographic area.
And that other blue line that you can see — it’s down right here — that’s the Seattle line.  And you can see that their response, because of the nursing home alert, they were one of the first states and the first metro areas to really move to social distancing.  And so they’ve really never had a peak, like many of the other metros.
Next slide.
Then I just want to take you through some of these new case graphics.  That was cumulative cases.  This is daily cases.  And obviously, there’s a lot of variability, and variability in reporting, but you get a sense over time, when you look at daily cases.
So New Orleans is on the — on panel on your left, and Baton Rouge on your right.  But you can see clearly, New Orleans, about a month ago, very low levels, probably less than 50 cases.  Large peak and spike around the beginning of April.  And they have come down, and they have it down to very few cases.  Again, I showed you before how both their syndromic cases have come down, as well as their actual case — number of cases.
Next slide.
This is Seattle.  So you can see they had a much lower peak.  And this is — when we talked about flattening the curve, this is what flattening the curve looks like.  It becomes a longer, slower decline, but it ever gets very high, and then goes back down.
Next slide.
And then this is Detroit.  And we always look at the metros as a consolidated.  So this is both Wayne and Oakland in Michigan.  And we really want to thank the mayor for the incredible job that they have done to really ensure that everyone is receiving the adequate healthcare and testing, and they’ve done quite a good job with testing in Michigan.
But all of these states — Louisiana and New York have tested 30,000 per million inhabitants.  Those are some of our highest numbers across the board.
And next slide.
And so the President talked about the case fatality rates, and we really — we’ve lost a lot of Americans to this disease, and we pray and hope for each one of them that are in the hospitals and the excellent care.
What this graph illustrates is the amazing work of the American people to really adhere to social distancing.  This was some — this was nothing we had ever attempted to do as a nation, and the world hadn’t attempted to do.  But they were able to decrease the number of cases so that, in general, most of the metro areas never had an issue of complete crisis care of all of their hospitals in the region.
And so you can see our case fatality rate is about half to a third of many of the other countries.
THE PRESIDENT:  And, excuse me, does anybody really believe this number?  Does anybody really believe this number?
DR. BIRX:  I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this could be.  When highly developed healthcare delivery systems — the United Kingdom and France and Belgium and Italy and Spain — with extraordinary doctors and nurses and equipment have case fatality rates in the 20s, up to 45, and Belgium’s extraordinarily competent healthcare delivery system, and then China at .33, you realize that these numbers, even — and this includes the doubled number out of Wuhan.
And so I wanted, really, to put it in perspective, but I wanted you also to see how great the care has been for every American that has been hospitalized and how extraordinary work of our doctors and nurses in our laboratorians on the front line who have been doing an excellent job.
Next slide.
And then we also wanted to show —
THE PRESIDENT:  If I might add, though, also —
DR. BIRX:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  — the number for Iran.  Does anybody really believe that number?  You see what’s going on over there.  Does anybody — put that slide back, if you would.  Does anybody believe this number?  Does anybody believe this number?  You saw more bags —
DR. BIRX:  And this is why —
THE PRESIDENT:  — on television than that.
DR. BIRX:  This is why the reporting is so important.  And I think you remember, almost six weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was telling you what Italy was showing to us and what France was telling to us, and the warnings that they gave to us and said, “Be very careful.  There’s an extraordinary high mortality among people with preexisting conditions.”  And we used their information to bring that to the American people.
That came — that alert — that alert, before we even had significant cases, came from our European colleagues on the front line.  And that’s why we keep coming back to how important, in a pandemic and a new disease, it’s really critical to have that level of transparency because it changes how we work as a nation.  It allowed us on — over March 15 to make an alert out there about vulnerable individuals and the — really, they need to protect them, and my call-out to millennials to really protect their parents, protect their grandparents, and get that information out to everyone that there were preexisting conditions that put people at greater risk.  That information came from our European colleagues who were in the midst of their battle themselves.
And so there is never an excuse to not share information.  When you are the first country to have an outbreak, you really have a moral obligation to the world to not only talk about it, but provide that information that’s critical to the rest of the world to really respond to this credibly.
And I really want to thank our European colleagues who have worked so hard to get us that information, even in the midst of their own tragedies.  And I think that really shows how important transparency is.
And we go to the next slide.
We can show you this really encouraging and great news: So we know that fatalities will continue to lag because people are in hospitals still, and some are still sit in intensive care units.
But these COVID-like illnesses — this is our hospitalizations that are related to flu per 100,000 Americans.  This is this year’s flu season.  And you can see our COVID-like illnesses.  And this is all of them, probable and confirmed cases.  Our hospitalizations are declining.
Now, I showed you metros that have made tremendous progress, and we’ve been up here many times talking about it being 6, 10, 15 additional cities.  And now we’re really just focused on Chicago and Boston and Massachusetts, and really some issues that Providence is starting to improve now.  So their relationship to the two large outbreak cities.  But this is really reassuring to us, the progress we’re making across the country against this disease.
And I’m — just really want to conclude by thanking again the American people for making these type of graphics possible; thank the data team who puts these together for me.  So they are working until about 3:30 every morning to make sure that we have the most up-to-date information.  That’s the data that goes to our supply-chain individuals to ensure that every hospital in every state and every community has what they need based on data, and to make sure that we’re serving the needs of the American people as effectively as possible.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.  Fantastic job.  Is this yours?
DR. BIRX:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
The fact is that we’ve been learning a lot from Deborah and Tony and so many of the professionals, the director.
PEPFAR: We’re spending — the United States, without help, to the best of my knowledge — mostly in Africa, $6 billion a year.  And that’s on AIDS.  What we’ve done for AIDS in Africa is unbelievable.  We spend $6 billion a year.  That’s been going on for a long time.  Nobody knows that; you’ve never heard that.  I’ve never heard that.  Six billion dollars a year.
Millions of people are living right now, and living very comfortably, because of the fact that we have found the answer to that horrible, horrible plague.  That was a plague.
But we spent $6 billion a year.  And from what I hear, it’s very well spent, done by professionals, including this great professional right here.  That was the thing that you worked hardest on and something that was very close to her heart.  So it’s — you know, it’s something that I think people should start hearing.
The World Health Organization: We’re just finding more and more problems.  And we spend this money really well.  There are other ways we can spend the $500 million.  That’s $500 million; this is $6 billion.  But we can find other ways to spend it where people are going to be helped, we think, in a much greater — in a much greater way.
We’re doing some research on certain people that take a lot of credit for what they do.  And NIH is giving away a lot of money — a lot of money.  We’d give away for years — for many years, they’d give away a lot of money.  And some people complain and some people don’t.  Some people are extremely happy.  So we’re looking into that also.
They’re giving away approximately, as I understand it, recently, more than $32 billion a year.  Thirty-two billion.  And so we’ve been looking at that for a while, and we’re going to be having some statements to be made about that.  Thirty-two billion dollars a year.  It’s a lot of money, and we want to make sure it’s being spent wisely.  And we’ve been doing that, by the way, and we’ll have some statements on that.
And those are much bigger numbers then what we’re talking about with national — if you — if you look, with the — with our friends from wherever they come from.  You know, 500 — 500 million is a lot of money, but it’s not a lot compared to the kind of money that we give out.  I think, over the years, it’s been averaging about 32 billion dollars.  Thirty-two billion.  So we’ve had our eye on that one for a while.
We also talked about the lab in China where, I guess, $3.7 million was given some time ago.  And we’re looking at that very closely.  Chief of Staff has that pretty much under control.  But it’s money that — too bad it got spent there.  But that was spent — what year was that, Mark?  That was four or five years ago?
MR. MEADOWS:  That was over the last six years.  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Six years ago, approximately.  So we’re looking at that.  And that’s the lab that people are talking about.
All right, so we’re looking at a lot of things.  There’s tremendous waste in our government.  We found it in many different ways and in many different forms.  And this is one of them.  This is one of them.
We can spend — I was talking to Dr. Birx — we can spend $500 million using all of it in a much more efficient manner if we’re — if we choose to do that.  And it’ll be to the good of many more people than are getting it right now.
But you look at the mistakes that were made — I mean, so late, long after I said we have to close off our country.  They were actually against our closing off our country to China.  When I did that in January, they were against that.  They didn’t like the idea of closing off our country.  They said it was a bad thing to do, actually, and they’ve since taken that back.  But it was a very lucky thing that we did it.  Very lucky.  We would have had numbers that were very significantly greater.  Tony Fauci said that.  He said it would have been very significantly greater had we not done that.
So we’ve made a lot of moves that were good moves, but it’s still a very depressing subject because it’s a lot of death.  And if it was stopped very early on at the source, before it started blowing into these proportions, you have 184 countries that would have been in a lot better shape.  But our country is getting back, and I expect that we’re going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.
All right, we’ll take a few questions.  Jeff.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-2/

6:22 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I just had a great conversation with the leading faith leaders of our country.  It went extremely well.  We learned a lot.  I learned a lot.  And we’re working on some things that are very interesting and very positive.  I thank them all for being on the call.
And yesterday, we unveiled detailed guidelines for America’s governors to initiate a phased, safe, and gradual reopening of America.  That’s what’s happening.  The guidelines provide governors with the fact-driven and science-based metrics they will need to make the decisions that are right for their own particular state.
To view the guidelines, you can go to the website at Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica.  So that’s Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica.
Treasury has sent out economic relief payments to more than 80 million Americans who have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS.  And an incredible success it has been.  If you have not received your check, please visit IRS.gov/GetMyPayment.  How about that one?  IRS.gov/GetMyPayment.  That way, the IRS can get you your payment in days — and they’ve done a fantastic job, I have to say — and you won’t have to wait for a check in the mail.
I have some very good news: We sent out 80 million deposits, and less than 1 percent had even little problems.  A couple had minor glitches, but it’s substantially less than 1 percent.  So out of 80 million deposits, less than 1 percent.  And that gets corrected immediately.  So just please do as I say.  You’ll get that very quickly, very easily.
Today, I’m also announcing that Secretary Perdue — who happens to be right next to me; handsome man — and the Department of Agriculture will be implementing a 19-billion-dollar relief program for our great farmers and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic.  Very honored to be doing this.  Our farmers, ranchers — we have — these are great people, great Americans.  Never complain.  They never complain.  They just do what they have to do.
The program will include direct payments to farmers as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat, and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need.
The USDA will receive another $14 billion in July that will have funding to continue help our — helping.  And this will help our farmers and our ranchers, and it’s money well deserved.  So not only were they targeted at one point by China — and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening.  And they never complained, but that worked out very well.  Twelve billion dollars they got, and sixteen billion dollars they got.  And now it’s $19 billion.
And I’m just going to ask Secretary Perdue to explain
exactly how we’re going to handle it.  Thank you.
SECRETARY PERDUE:  Well, Mr. President, you may remember earlier this year, you tweeted a message to our farmers and ranchers that, no matter their circumstances, you pledged to stand behind them.  And while none of us could ever have anticipated this type of pandemic that we’re currently in, I think today’s announcement is proof that you’ve put our — you have our farmers’ backs and that you will continue to do what it takes to support them.  And they are very grateful.
We’ve heard a lot recently — all of you — about our food supply chain.  I think America now knows that, more than ever, the wholesome food that our families depend upon, it starts with America’s farmers and ranchers.  America agriculture has been hard hit, like most of America, with the coronavirus, and President Trump is standing with our farmers and all Americans to make sure we all get through this national emergency.
So today, thanks to your direction and leadership, Mr. President, USDA is announcing the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.  As you mentioned, this new 19-billion-dollar program will take several immediate actions to assist farmers, ranchers, and consumers in response to the COVID-19 national emergency.
The program is really divided into two parts.  One is a direct payment — $16 billion in direct payments to farmers, ranchers, and producers who have experienced unprecedented losses during this pandemic.
Since we wanted to get the payments out to producers as quickly as possible, we decided to use the funds in the CCC — the current funds of 6.5 million — billion dollars, combined with the 19.5 of COVID money, rather than wait for the replenishment of the CCC funds in July.  Based on industry estimates of damage, Mr. President, it is becoming apparent that we’ll need the additional CCC funds as we continue to track the economic losses.
Secondly — and this is really important as well — the USDA will be purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat products to be distributed to Americans in need through our food bank networks, as well as other community and faith-based organizations.  Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking, as well, to those who produce them.
This program will not only provide direct financial relief to our farmers and ranchers, Mr. President, who will allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance in this country to help our fellow Americans in need.
So in recent weeks, we’ve seen — all of us seen the heroic patriotism of our food supply-chain workers, and they’ve shown, day in and day out, doing the work to serve the needs of fellow Americans.
Our farmers have been in the fields planting and doing what they do every spring to feed the American people, even with a pandemic, as we speak.
I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your unwavering support.  They want to thank you for your unwavering support for America’s farmers and ranchers.  And I want to commit to you, Mr. President, and to the American people that USDA will do everything in our power to implement this program as quickly and as efficiently as possible to help our farmers, ranchers, producers, and consumers during this great time of need.
So thank you very much for having me here today.  And God bless you.  God bless America.  God bless American agriculture.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, Sonny.  Fantastic job.  Thank you, Sonny.
So, our great Secretary of Agriculture was the governor of Georgia for eight years, and the only reason he isn’t still there, frankly, is that he was term limited.  And I said, “Let’s get him for agriculture.”  And you’ve done a fantastic job.  We want to thank you very much.  Eight years at Georgia.  We really appreciate it.  Great job.
Even as we prepare to rebuild our economy, America continues to wage an all-out medical war to defeat the invisible enemy.  To date, we have conducted more than 3.78 million coronavirus tests — by far, the most of any country; it’s not even close.  In the hardest-hit areas, such as New York and Louisiana, we’ve also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country.
The United States has the most robust, advanced, and accurate testing system anywhere in the world.  As of yesterday, we have distributed nearly 660,000 Abbott IDs.  Now, that’s a — an incredible test.  It’s called the ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic test.  And it’s fantastic.  It’s a hot — it’s the hot one.  The problem with this business is it’s the hot one until about two days from now, because we do have a saliva test that just came out, and that can be self-administered, and it’s said to be fantastic.
I want to thank Abbott Laboratories.  They have been incredible.  I want to thank Roche.  They’ve likewise been incredible.
Over the last several days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests conducted by hospitals and academic institutions, which have now performed nearly 600,000 tests.  There is a tremendous amount of unused capacity in the states available for governors to tap.  We have tremendous unused capability within those laboratories, and I hope the governors are going to be able to use them.  The governors are responsible for testing, and I hope they’re going to be able to use this tremendous amount of available capacity that we have.
It’s up to 1 million additional tests per week — when you think of that.  In the next few weeks, we’ll be sending out 5.5 million testing swabs to the states.  Swabs can be done easily by the governors themselves.  Mostly, it’s cotton.  It’s not a big deal.  You can get cotton easily.  But if they can’t get it, we will take care of it.
Yesterday, the FDA announced a new collaboration with United Health Group, the Gates Foundation, Quantigen, and U.S. Cotton to greatly expand the supply of essential swabs, including a new polyester Q-tip-type swab for the coronavirus testing.  All of these actions will help our testing capability continue to grow dramatically.
So we’re helping people, even with swabs.  We get ventilators.  We’re now the king of ventilators.  We have hundreds of thousands under construction.  We don’t need them ourselves.  The governors are in great shape.  If we do, we have a great stockpile that we’ll immediately send to the state in need.  But we’ve handled that situation incredibly well.  I hope people understand it.  I wish the media would get the word out.  What we’ve done in ventilators is amazing, because they’re big, expensive, and highly complex.
We’re speaking to other countries.  I spoke to the President of Mexico today — a great gentleman — and I told him that we are going to be helping him out with ventilators, helping Mexico out.  And we’ll be helping some other countries too.  We have a lot of very high-level, high-quality ventilators.  And they’re here, and they’re also being manufactured as we speak.
Following the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and in politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity — it’s totally false and misleading — demonstrating a complete failure to understand the enormous scope of the testing capabilities that we’ve brought online.  And we started, really, from ground zero.  We started from really being very, very outdated and obsolete as a country, from the past.
And I will say this: If they didn’t understand it, it’s just really — unfortunately, I hate to say this because we’ve been getting along very well, but it would be false reporting, because they understand the capability.  And it’s going to be up to the states to use that capability.  The states have local points where they can go — a governor can call the mayors, and the mayors can call representatives, and everybody — everything is perfect.  And that’s the way it should work and always should work.
We’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing.  We have to get even better.  And some people think a little bit differently.  There are areas where you have vast amounts of area where you have very few people and almost no people are infected.  And those places will be looked upon differently by different governors.  And I think you’re going to have a lot of news coming out about that over the next few days.  I think certain states are going to come online, and they’re going to start the early stages of the puzzle that we’re putting together.  And it’s going to be together sooner rather than later.  A lot of really incredible things are happening.
And at some point in the not-too-distant future, we’re going to have our country back.  And it’s going to be, I think, really — with what we’re doing on stimulus, and helping people keep their businesses together and their lives together and their jobs, it’s going to be better than ever before.  I hope so.  I really do.
The current conversation is reminiscent of what happened on ventilators — you remember that — when requests were made far beyond what was objectively needed.  We were hearing from a certain state and we were hearing from a lot that they needed far more ventilators.  In one case, they wanted 40,000 ventilators — 40,000.  It turned out that they had plenty and they had a number of about 7- or 8,000, and that was plenty.  We supplied them with a lot.  But that was the right number; we got it just about right.  And if they did need more, we’re ready to give more, but I think the surge seems to be over.
And there are a lot of governors just doing a great job.  And they’re working with us, but we’re all working together.
The research and development that we’ve done at the federal level has been absolutely incredible.  The media will be accepting of these figures when they get to see the end result.  I think they’re going to see it and I think they’re already seeing it.  That includes not only ventilators, but beds.  We’ve built, in most cases, far more than they even needed, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.
This is what the governors wanted.  They wanted a certain amount in Louisiana.  I spoke with the governor; I had a long talk with him.  And I said, “Do you think you’ll need that final hospital?”  And they actually didn’t need it.  We built a lot of — a lot of beds.  So, I appreciate it, from the governor.
And we saved — building a hospital in New York, we did a — I think, just a spectacular job at the Javits Center.  And even sending the ship up became — we brought it into COVID, but they didn’t — they didn’t really need it.  It didn’t get much use, but it was there and ready.  It wasn’t supposed to be used for that purpose; we changed it into that purpose.  And it was there — ready, willing, and able.  Same with Javits, but they didn’t quite need the rooms that we — the beds that we — we produced.
So we produced almost 2,900 beds, and I think I’d rather tell you that we were over-prepared that we were — than we were underprepared.  And that was a good-faith effort by New York, I have to say that.  A very good faith effort.  But it’s nice that we didn’t need that, instead of needing it.  It was not very occupied, but it was ready to go.  It’s still there should something happen, but I think they have it under very good control.
As you’ll hear from our experts today, we’ve already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide for states to begin their reopenings.  And I think you’ll be hearing a lot about reopenings in the coming weeks and months.  Most excitingly, in the coming weeks, I think you’re going to see some very, very dramatic steps taken and very safely.  We’re putting safety first.  We may be opening, but we’re putting safety first.
And when you look at the numbers, when you look at the possible number of death — deaths at 2.2 million people — and it could have very well been that.  It could have been more.  Frankly, I’ve been looking at numbers where it could have been higher than that — 2.2 million people dying.  If you figure we lost 500,000, maybe 600,000 in the Civil War.  2.2 million people.
A minimum, if we did nothing, would have been 1.6 [million].  If you cut that in half, you’re talking about 800,000, 900,000, a million people dying.  But we did a lot of work, and the people of this country were incredible, I have to say.  And I think we’re heading to the other category, and that would be if we did work and if it was successful, they had between 100,000 and 220,000 to 240,000 on the upside.  And I think we’ll be substantially, hopefully, below the hundred number.  And I think, right now, we’re heading at probably around 60-, maybe 65,000.
And one is too many.  I always say it: One is too many.  This is a horrible thing that happened to our country.  This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries all over the world.  This is a horrible thing, and there was no reason for it.  It should never, ever happen again.
In a few minutes, you’ll be hearing from Dr. Redfield, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, and Admiral Giroir to explain these facts in — in really great detail.
Earlier this week, the FDA authorized two new antibody tests — which is very exciting — that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the virus, bringing the total to four authorized antibody tests already.  This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity.
Ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America’s scientific brilliance.  There is nothing like us.  There is nobody like us.  Not even close.  I wish I could tell you stories — what other countries, even powerful countries, say to me — the leaders.  They say it quietly and they say it off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do.
And our country is at a point — a few weeks ago, think of it — four or five weeks ago, we were at a level that nobody had ever attained: the best job numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had.  Every company virtually was doing better business than ever before.  The stock market was at all-time highs.
And then one day, they said, “You got to close it up.”  And we did the right thing.  We saved maybe millions of lives by doing it the way we did it.  But we’re paying a price, but that price is very unimportant compared to the number of lives we’re talking about.
The NIH and others are conducting clinical trials of 35 different therapies and treatments — therapies being so exciting to me, because that’s really like — if something happens, you’re going to get better reasonably quickly and without such a horrible deal, as some people have to go through.
To that end, today NIH announced that it is launching a public-private partnership with more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies.  They’re — HHS, FDA, CDC, and the European Medicines Agency, they’re all working together.  We’re working together with a lot of other countries.
The partnership will marshal and coordinate the vast resources, knowledge, assets, and authorities of more than a dozen organizations and agencies to accelerate development of the most promising therapies and vaccines.  The vaccines are coming along really, really well.  Johnson & Johnson is very well advanced.
One thing is they have to — we’re having great, great success, but we have to test them and it takes a long period of time.  It takes probably over a year, unfortunately.  But therapies likewise are coming along very, very well.  Therapies are immediate.  When we get that, that’ll be a big day.
We’re also equipping our medical warriors on the frontlines.  In total, we have the Project Air Bridge — and the air bridge has been incredible; the National Strategic Stockpile; and every other channel the federal government has deployed.  If you think about this: 44.5 million N95 masks, nearly 524 million gloves, 63.5 million surgical masks, and more than 10 million gowns.  And we have 500 million masks coming in very soon, between manufacturing and orders — 500 million masks.
The last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of our nation.  This invisible enemy is tough and it’s smart and it’s vicious.  But every day, we’re getting closer to the future that we all have been waiting for.  I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel; we are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel.
And it’s happening, and I want to thank everybody in the room.  I want to thank — I actually want to thank some of the media.  We’ve had some fair coverage — some really fair coverage — and I appreciate it.
What I’m going to do is I’m going to introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence, and he’s going to take over for a little while.  I’m going to leave and I’m coming right back, and we’ll take some questions.  They’re going to go over our tremendous testing capabilities.  And again, I’ll be right back.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President, and good afternoon all.
Today, as the President just reflected, it remains a challenging time in the life of our nation.  But because of the extraordinary efforts of the American people, because of the strong partnership the federal government has forged with states across the country, we’re making progress, America.
Despite the — the tragic loss of more than 36,000 Americans, according to our best data reporting this morning, we continue to see new cases low and steady on the West Coast.  And we continue to see cases and hospitalizations declining in the Greater New York City area, in New Orleans, and Detroit, and elsewhere.
This is a tribute, first and foremost, to our — our healthcare doctors, nurses — all of those working on the frontlines.  But it’s also a great tribute to the American people, who have put into practice the social distancing, the guidelines, the guidance of state and local officials.  And we — we hope that every American is encouraged by the steady progress that we are making.
We’re continuing to bring, at the President’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to bear.  Today, the President approved a major disaster declaration for American Samoa, and now all 50 states and all territories are under major disaster declarations for the first time in American history.
At this present moment, 33,000 National Guardsmen are on duty; 5,500 active duty military personnel have been deployed to 9 states, including 716 medical professionals, doctors, and nurses who deployed out to 14 different hospitals today.  Among those were 10 hospitals in New York City.  And military personnel were also serving today in hospitals in Connecticut, Texas, Louisiana, and New Jersey.
Yesterday, as the President reflected, we unveiled the President’s Guidelines for Opening up America Again.  There were two parts at the beginning of those guidelines.  First, the criteria that we hope will guide governors in their decisions about reopening their states on either a statewide level or a county level.  And then also, we outlined what we believe would be the most important state responsibilities to have in place before moving into a reopening plan.
For phase one, the President’s guidelines, you’ll recall it advised that states that have a downward trajectory in cases over a 14-day period of time and ensure that they have proper capacity in their healthcare facilities could move to phase one with the easing of some of the social distancing and the criteria that have been in place.
But for states that meet the criteria, we outlined specific responsibilities protecting workers in critical industries, particularly protecting the most vulnerable, those who live and work in senior care facilities.  And we also encouraged states to have a plan for testing symptomatic individuals and ensuring testing to our most vulnerable populations.
As the President has made clear, governors will decide the time and manner that their states reopen, and we will look to support them in that effort.  But as we assured the American people yesterday, at the President’s direction, our administration will continue to work with governors across the country to ensure that they have the equipment and the supplies and the testing resources to reopen safely and responsibly.
On the subject of supplies, today we issued a letter to our nation’s governors summarizing all the medical equipment and supplies that have been distributed to their state from FEMA between the first of this month and April 14, through Project Airbridge and through the commercial supply network.  We’ll be speaking with our nation’s governors on Monday and detailing that information at that time.
As of April 16th, as the President reflected briefly, FEMA has coordinated the delivery of millions of pieces of medical equipment, including 44 million N95 respirators, 63 million surgical masks, more than 10,000 ventilators, and of course, deployed more than 8,600 federal medical station beds.
On the subject of testing resources, we’re going to take some time to speak about our administration’s approach and partnership with states to continue to expand testing across the country at this briefing.
But from the very outset of this epidemic, President Trump made efforts to essentially reinvent testing in America.  The traditional testing in this country that takes place at CDC or at state labs was designed for basically the kind of diagnostic testing that is routinely required.  But the President, early on in this effort, brought together the leading commercial labs in America, and we forged a public and private partnership.  And six weeks ago, we had performed some 25,000 tests, and at this day, we have performed 3.7 million tests.
We believe that labs and hospitals are now performing more than 120,000 tests a day.  And we’ve actually stood up a team from Walter Reed, under the direction of Dr. Deborah Birx, that is working around the clock to identify additional testing capacity across the country.  We believe that states could actually more than double the amount of daily testing that is happening today by simply activating all of the labs.  And Dr. Birx will detail some of those resources today, and we’ll be going over those very specifically with governors on Monday.
We’ve also been promoting the development of new and innovative tests.  We all know about the 15-minute Abbott test, but the FDA is currently working on an antibody test that literally could add 20 million new tests to our supply, even before the end of April.
I want to assure the American people that we’re going to continue to work with your governors and with your state health officials to scale testing in the days ahead.  But as you’ll hear from all of our experts tonight, our best scientists and health experts assess that states today have enough tests to implement the criteria of phase one, if they choose to do so.
Let me say that again: Given the — given the guidance in the President’s new Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, states that meet the criteria for going into phase one, and then are preparing the testing that is contemplated by going to phase one, our best scientists and health experts assess that, today, we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a phase one reopening, if state governors should choose to do that.  And you’ll hear more detail on that in just a moment.
At the President’s direction, we’re going to be presenting an outline of our approach to testing in partnership with states, during this briefing.  Our approach will continue to be locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.
Dr. Fauci will give us a brief introduction to the overall approach to testing that is contemplated to deal with the coronavirus.  Dr. Redfield and the CDC will describe our plan to mobilize CDC officials in all 50 states to specifically monitor coronavirus — coronavirus incidents that occur in every state in the union.
Of course, Dr. Deborah Birx will describe not only our tests, but also the current capability and the capability that we could expand to very readily.  And Admiral Giroir of the U.S. Public Health Service will summarize our approach.
But I want to assure the American people that, at the President’s direction, we are going to continue to work every single day to make sure that our states and communities have the testing they need to reopen at the time and manner of their choosing.  And we’re going to work every day to make sure our states have the resources and the supplies to reopen their states and reopen America in a safe and responsible way.
With that, Dr. Fauci.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  So, as the Vice President said, I’m going to give you a brief introduction to, kind of, answer the question that we’ve been asked a lot.  In fact, we had a very productive teleconference with the Senate Democratic Caucus just a few hours ago, and they asked a number of questions which were really reasonable questions — questions that are on the mind of a lot of different people.  And one of them was the question that was just posed a moment ago, is: Are there enough tests to allow us to be able to go through this first phase in a way that is protective of the health and the safety of the American people?
So I just want to spend a couple of minutes clarifying a few things and maybe providing some information on a broad 40,000 foot, which you’ll hear some of the more granular details from my colleagues who will be following me.  I think they — they asked me to give the “40,000 foot” one because I’m not a testing person; I didn’t run a testing lab, but I’m part of a team that is looking at this of how we can best make sure that this happens in the right way.
So, first of all, let me say something that we’ve said before, and I apologize if I’m repeating things that you already know, but I think in some respects it’s important to do that so that people have clarity in what we’re talking about.
There are two general types of tests, even though within each general type there are different subgroups.  One of them is to actually test for the infection: is a person infected.  The other — and I’ll get back to that in a second.  The other is to test, as we just mentioned, if someone has been infected — usually someone who’s been infected, who has recovered.  And as I’ll get to in a moment, that you could assume — although, we need to do some more work on that — that that person is actually protected against subsequent exposure and infection with an identical organism.
So what are some of the pluses and minuses of each?  Because the pluses and minuses are really going to impact how we best use the test and how the test actually should be used.
So let’s take the test for whether or not you’re infected. The test of whether or not you’re infected is a test that, right now, is called a nucleic acid test.  It’s not an easy test to do.  There are some that are more rapid.  There are some that have a high throughput.  There are different groups within that.  The good news about that is that it’s a sensitive and specific test, so that if you’re infected, you know you’re infected, so that — as I’ll get to in a moment — if you need to do something with that — get that person, put them in care, take care of them, get them out of circulation — that’s important.
The point about that that I think is often misunderstood is that if you get a test today — like I did today; it’s negative — if you get a test today, that does not mean that tomorrow or the next day or the next day or the next day, as you get exposed, perhaps from someone who may not even know they’re infected, that that means that I’m negative.  Which means, if you take that to its extreme, in order to be really sure, you would almost have to test somebody either every day or every other day or every week or what it is to be absolutely certain.  That’s an issue.
Now, the problem that I talk about when I try and compare this to other situations, with what testing means to you — I, as I think most people know, have been involved in HIV/AIDS for 38 years, 39 years — from the very first week of HIV.  So that’s what I do.  If you get a test for HIV and you are negative, and you do not practice any risk behaviors, you can be guaranteed that next month, six months, one year from now, you will be negative if you don’t have a risk behavior.  So there’s a big difference there about what testing actually means.
So the point I think you’re getting is that, although there is clearly a place for needing to test somebody for a given reason, a test means you’re negative now.
Now, the other test is an antibody test — a test that tells you, in fact, that you’ve been infected.  That’s really good.  You’re going to hear about that — a bit about that from my colleagues in a moment.  Because that will give you a broad view of two things: one, what the penetrance of the infection had been; and number two, you can make an assumption — though we still need to prove that.  I mean, we are assuming that if you’re infected and you have antibody, you’re protected.  And I think that’s a reasonable assumption, based on our experience with other viruses.
But what we want to make sure that we know, and these are some of the challenges: What is the titer that is protective?  How long is the protection?  Is it one month?  Is it three months?  Is it six months?  It’s a year?  So we need to be humble and modest that we don’t know everything about it, but it really is an important test.
The other thing is the difference between testing and monitoring out there — what’s out there.  The difference between what we really need it for, for phase one, is to be able to identify, isolate, contact trace.  A very important part of when you’re putting — pulling back gradually and slowly on the mitigation, and you have people who might be infected — you want to know they’re infected; you want to put them in care.  That is something that we absolutely need to do.
But there are other ways we — I want to make sure people understand that — not to underestimate the importance of testing.  Testing is a part, an important part, of a multifaceted way that we are going to control and ultimately end this outbreak.
So please don’t anyone interpret it that I’m downplaying testing, but the emphasis that we’ve been hearing is essentially, “testing is everything,” and it isn’t.  It’s the kinds of things that we’ve been doing — the mitigation strategies — that are an important part of that.
Now, just a couple of things before I hand it over to my colleagues.  No doubt — no doubt that, early on, we had a problem.  I had publicly said that we had a problem early on.  There was a problem that had to be corrected, and it was corrected.  It was a problem that was a technical problem from within that was corrected.  And it was an issue of embracing — the way we have now, and should have — the private sector, who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them for any of the things that I’ve just spoken about.
So, having said that, right now, I totally understand — and I am not alone; my colleagues understand — that although we say there are X number of tests out there — and you’re going to hear from Admiral Giroir about that — the fact is there have been and still are situations that are correctable, and will be corrected, and some of which have been corrected.
I know — I get on the phone a lot with my colleagues, because, believe it or not, some long time ago, I was where they are in the hospitals, in the emergency room, looking at very sick individuals that you need to take care of.  And I know what it means when someone tells you, “Hey, you have what you need,” and you look around and you say, “Well, maybe you think I have what I need, but I don’t really have what I need.”  So we have to figure out: How do we close that gap?
And there are a lot of things that I think we’ve learned, and that we are correcting and going to correct.  Namely, you have a situation where tests are needed and appropriate.  And either people have found there’s no tests or there’s no reagents or there’s no swabs — or a person needed a test and were told that there was a restriction; they couldn’t get a test.  These are all the things that I’m telling — you already know because you’ve heard them.  So right now — or there’s a delay of five to seven days.  And what does that mean if you want to do — if you want to get somebody out of circulation?
We understand that that existed, but upon careful examination, what you are going to hear: that many of those have been already corrected and other of those will be corrected.  Because what I think people don’t appreciate, through no fault of their own, is that there’s — that there are two issues: There’s supply and demand.  And if you have a supply that can meet the demand, but the supply is not connected to the demand, then supply/demand falls apart.
What do I mean by that?  I mean there is an existing capacity that we have that, for one reason or other, maybe has not been fully communicated as to the availability of that existing capacity.  And you’re going to hear about that now.  There’s production capacity that gets better and better and better.  And that’s what we’re talking about, because for what we need now, we believe that, with better communications, we’ll be able to make that happen.
So I know there’s going to be a lot of questions about that.  I didn’t want to go on too long, but let me just finish by saying, given what I’ve just said and what I believe what you’re going to hear, that, for what we need in the first phase — if these things are done correctly, what I believe they can — we will have and there will be enough tests to allow us to take this country safely through phase one.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony.
Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I want to make a few comments here.  First, I want to talk a little bit about CDC has developed multiple systems to monitor disease outbreaks.  I think many of you are familiar, for example, how we monitor for foodborne illness or how we monitor for antibiotic resistance in hospitals.  But we’ve also developed a system to monitor for upper respiratory tract disease.  If I can get the first slide there.
This is an example — because when we talk about what we know about this current pandemic, the reality is we know a lot because we’ve developed these monitoring systems.
Up on the slide is a system that we’ve developed initially for flu.  And what it does, as you can see, there’s multiple different flu seasons, and they track them over the course of a year.
I want you to look at the red line.  And that happens to be this year’s respiratory season.  And you see there’s a peak there up over the 50-52 week.  And that peak was when we actually had a peak of Influenza B.
This year was a little different because after that viral syndrome came down — and you can see it — that actually we had another peak.  And that’s when Influenza A was active through our country.  And you can see Influenza A started to drop.  But then you saw a third peak.  That peak was — here, we’re were looking at the coronavirus-19.
So we have systems, all the way down to the county level, that we can see where there’s respiratory tract illness.  And so it’s not just — just taking a test.  It’s monitoring these systems that have been developed over the last — over decades.  And we have multiple ones.
We have another one — this — that is monitored in emergency rooms, looking at syndrome diagnosis.  And they show the same thing.  So we’re well equipped to monitor — to see when respiratory tract viral disease will come.  And it becomes a very good surrogate for when you can begin to understand that we need to start looking more at ideologically about what’s going on.
You can see now, in week 15, we’re really coming down to the baseline background, in terms of our flu surveillance system, from the overall coronavirus situation right now.
The second thing I wanted to say is that CDC continues to enhance the state’s public health capacity to accelerate their ability — as Tony talked about, and it’s critical as we open America again — to diagnose individuals that present with influenza-like illness or coronavirus-like illness, to diagnose them, to be able to isolate them, and to be able to contact trace around them, and then diagnose the contacts.  And those that are coronavirus-positive, to go back and do their contacts.
This is the traditional public health approach, which was started in this outbreak in January, in February, and was quite successful.  And as I mentioned before, through February 27th, this country only had 14 cases.  We did that isolation and that contact tracing, and it was very successful.  But then, when the virus more exploded — got beyond the public health capacity.
But right now, CDC is enhancing that public health capacity.  And if I can get the second slide, I want to show you that — this is just showing, as we sit here today, that CDC has embedded, in these health departments and all of these state — states across this country, more than 500 individuals.  We also have an additional almost 100 individuals that are working on more than 20 coronavirus outbreaks that are going through all these states.
And finally, at the direction of the President, we’ve been asked to further enhance this deployment in each of the states, as the Vice President said, so that there’s additional public health personnel to help accelerate the state’s ability to basically move forward aggressively.  And we assist them so they can operationalize the President’s Guidelines To Open Up America Again.
So I just wanted to make those points for you today.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.
Dr. Birx.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield, for all of that clarity.
If we can have the next slide, I’m going to go back to what Dr. Fauci was talking about just to emphasize those points about the two types of tests and I’m going to talk about a third one.
So first, we all know about sampling in the front of your nose.  To all of the labs out there and to the providers, you don’t have to use the nasal pharyngeal swab anymore; you can do front-of-nose sampling.  And again, as Dr. Fauci talked about, is that is sampling for the virus itself that replicates in your nose and, as we know, throughout some of the respiratory tissues.
The second test is, of course, then your immune response to that infection that’s in your nose.  And so, that’s the antibody test.  And so those are the two tests we want to talk about.
But I want to come back to something that both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield said and we covered yesterday: Testing is a part of the exquisite monitoring that needs to occur in partnership with CDC and state and local governments, utilizing the surveillance systems that are available — what we just talked about: the flu surveillance system, because we no longer have flu, and the syndromic respiratory system.  That is across the United States, and you can see it’s going back to baseline so that we’ll be able to see, at the community level, any deviation from that baseline.
In addition, what we talked about yesterday was adding that asymptomatic component.  Because I think you’ll see, as more and more articles come out for surveillance that other — and monitoring that other states have done, higher and higher antibody in multiple individuals who don’t remember having a sickness.  And that will give us an idea — that’s our asymptomatic monitoring in these sentinel monitoring sites.  And what we talked about yesterday — we talked about nursing homes, we talked about indigenous people, and we talked about vulnerable people in the inner city, really ensuring that something that is so small, that can’t even be seen on the surveillance monitoring, will be able to be seen in the asymptomatic.
And so those are the two tests that we have: one available now, two that have been approved — or three, by the FDA.
I want to just leave you with my last concept on the antibody tests.  Antibody tests have different specificity and sensitivities.  The FDA, we’ve made that — the FDA has been very cautious about the antibody tests because I see — I know you see reports every day of countries that have ordered the antibody test and found that they were 50, 60, 70 percent faulty.  So we’re taking that very seriously because you never want to tell someone that they have an antibody and potential immunity when they don’t.  And so those tests perform better when there’s a high prevalence or a high incidence of disease.
So we want to work with mayors around the United States, as those antibody tests become available, to really see what it is in first responders and healthcare workers in the highest prevalence states, so that we can know about the quality and the real-life, real-field experience of those assays.  Because things can look very good in the lab, and then when you take them into the field, sometimes they’re not as good.  I’ve learned this lesson repeatedly in working around the globe.
The next slide.
So this is what we have asked commercial and diagnostic companies to be working on, because when you talk about multi-millions’ worth of tests, the way we do this in the United States today for strep, for influenza, and for malaria, is we test for the antigen.  Now, we don’t know, right now, if you shed antigen in the front of your nose.  And so that is the question that scientists and companies are working on right now.  Because that becomes a simpler test.
Now, the flu test — I think many of you will look it up tonight — you will see that outside of the flu season, because of the specificity of the test, it doesn’t work so well.  So these are tests we’re working on today that would be like a screening test, because if you’re positive on it, it’s a good test, but it may miss that you actually have the flu.  So then you would move into the — what we call the “nucleic acid test.”
So we’re trying to build an algorithm of tests that bring the full talent of the science of the United States into the reality of the clinic.  And so, bench to clinic.  And so this is what we’re working on for the future.
Next slide.
So as I promised both the senators and the governors, this is the United States’ current platform capacity, designated as high and low throughput.  And what do I mean by that?  There’s — we’ve talked about the high-throughput platforms of Roche and Abbott and others.  And then we’ve talked about the gene expert and other machines that may be moderate to lower throughput.
I want you to see how it’s distributed through the United States.  So these are the current testing platforms available today throughout the United States for COVID-19.  And as you heard from Dr. Fauci, everything has to be working, from the swab, to the transport media, to the laboratory, to really get those tests run and the results back to the client.
The next slide.
So then we’ve looked at all of the testing capacity from those platforms, and this gives you an idea of what that capacity is.  The darkest red — you can see, like, in Texas and New York, those are — those are states that have lots of different platforms, as you saw on the prior slide, and the ability, if you just add up the platforms and the potential for test, of over a million tests per month.
And so this is what we’re working with each of those states on unlocking that full potential.  And how are we doing that?  Well, we’re call- — we’re calling on the American Society of Microbiologists.  They have — they work closely with 300 lab directors around this — around the country; we talked with them this morning.  And the Walter Reed team who developed the entire HIV testing program for the military 35 years ago.
I’ve called them back into service and they’re calling lab by lab to find out what are the technical difficulties to bring up all the platforms that exist in your lab.  Is it swabs?  Is it transport media?  Is it extraction?  And I just really want to thank them.  They’ve already worked through over 70-plus of those laboratories to really understand.  And the American Society of Microbiologists and the academic societies of the laboratories are working together to ensure that all of this potential can be unlocked.
Next slide, please.
We talked a little bit yesterday about New Orleans, and we — and the President talked about how many tests New Orleans has done during its outbreak, which you can see now is waning.  They’ve done, throughout the last month, 27 tests per 1,000 New Orleans and Louisianians.  So 27 per thousand.  So that is a good mark, and that’s what — Italy has done about 20 per thousand.
So in evaluating an outbreak — and really to get control of this outbreak — they did about 27 tests per thousand.  So using that as a measure — next slide — we then looked across all the states of the United States of America, and looked for states that had 30 or more — ability to do 30 or more tests per thousand of their inhabitants in each state.  And you can see that, across the country, except for Oregon and Maine and —
DR. FAUCI:  Montana.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Montana.
DR. BIRX:  (Laughs.)  Montana.  I worked overseas way too long.  Thank you all.   So those are the three states that we’re working on building capacity in.  So this is just to give you a perspective of how seriously we’re taking the testing issue.
As we’ve described, we’ve measured every single platform and every single state.  We know exactly where they are, by geography, by address, by zip code, what their capacity is, what their cumulative capacity is, what their roadblocks are on non-ability to run all their full capacity.  And we’re addressing those because each one of those is different and you have to address each of them one by one with the governors, with the state and local labs, and with all of the hospitals.
I have not come across one laboratory or one laboratory director or one society that doesn’t want to contribute to solving this issue of testing and ensuring that this testing is available for everyone.
There is a strong — just as all the Americans have social distanced, and behind everyone — we don’t often talk about the laboratories; we’ll talk about the nurses and doctors on the front line — behind all of them are the laboratory technicians and laboratory directors who are coming in every day and putting things together to ensure that every single person that needs to be diagnosed is diagnosed.
And hopefully you can see from these labs — I mean these slides that, really, there is capacity out there.  It is our job, working with the states and having the state in the leadership role, and the laboratory directors in the leadership role to provide support to ensure that all the potential for testing in the United States is brought to bear.
I just want to end with — these are nucleic acid tests.  There will never be the ability on a nucleic acid test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school, but there might be with the antigen test.  And so that’s why there’s a role for nucleic acid test, there’s a role for antibody tests, and there’s a role for the future development of these other key tests to bring the full ability to the United States.
And so, when we finish this, we’ll be talking to all Americans because there’s other tests that other Americans should have.  And I think this has really brought to light the importance of diagnosis.  And we’ll talk to you further about hepatitis C and TB and other things that we can do to assure every American is healthy because I think this has really raised the awareness among all Americans about how you do test for different kinds and different parts of your disease state and what is long-lasting immunity, and what may be long-lasting immunity, and what is a nucleic acid test and what an antigen test is.
And with that, Admiral Giroir.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  And let me amplify one point, as the Admiral steps forward, to conclude remarks about our approach and the efforts we put underway.
Governors across the country have been working very closely with us to roll out the level of testing that we have today.  And all the information we presented to you is going to be reviewed in the days ahead and with all of our governors.  Our objective is to connect every one of America’s governors and state health officials and to all of the labs that are currently able to do coronavirus.
And — but Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have both described, we believe today that we have the capacity in the United States to do a sufficient amount of testing for states to move into phase one at the time and manner that they deem to be appropriate.
And with that, I’ll allow Admiral Giroir to complete our briefing on testing.  And we expect the President to return.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you to all my really great colleagues.
Can I have the — my next slide?
So I wanted to start by where we are today and just to visit where we’ve come in such a short period of time.  As everyone on the stage has said before, our testing right now is well over 3.78 million tests that have been completed.  And if you are impressed by bar graphs, that’s over 1.2 million tests reported just in the last week.
Ambassador Birx talked to me a little earlier, and she said, “You know, we only do about 2 million molecular tests a year for HIV” — something that’s been done for — developed for 35 years.  We’re now doing twice that number of tests in a month for a disease that has never been known before, that there’s never been a test developed before.  And that’s sort of where we are and where we’ve ramped up.
I also want to give you a little idea — the lighter blue or lighter gray is our ID NOW tests.  So we talk about them a lot because they are a point-of-care test that can be between 5 and 15 minutes.  And they have a very specific role, but they’re not for everybody.  If you’ve got to screen a few thousand people, four tests an hour doesn’t get you there on a machine; you have to use some of the larger, higher-throughput items.  But they have a very important role.  And, again, coming into the market at 50,000 per day is really an important adjunct to us.
She talked about the GeneXpert from Cepheid.  Very important.  We don’t talk about that very much, but it is one of the backbone mobile point-of-care — not as easy to do, per se, as the Abbott — but it is a point-of-care test that really carries tuberculosis screening all through Africa.  There are these machines — you saw that on her slide — every one of the 50 states has this in over 600 sites, and they’ve done over 700,000 tests just on that relatively low throughput, but very important platform.
Next slide, please.
I wanted to give you an idea of, sort of, how the tests are distributed and how they’re changing over time.  On the left are the state public health laboratories.  And although their numbers are relatively small — about 350,000 — the state public health laboratories are absolutely critical.  They’re — they’re an absolutely critical core component of our testing.  Not only were they there early and first, but they also do things like support outbreak investigations in nursing homes or investigations in certain plants that have close proximity with everyone because of their work environments.  They also do testing on many people who do not have the opportunity to be tested elsewhere.  And they are performing outstandingly well.
ACLA — I know we hate acronyms, but the American Clinical Laboratory Association — this is America’s commercial industrial backbone that we’re standing behind the President and the Vice President.  And when I was there a few weeks ago in the Rose Garden — this is the LabCorp, the Quest, the BioReference Laboratory, Mayo, Sonic, and ARUP.  And you’ll see they’ve done almost 2.3 million tests.  This is the very large, high-throughput machines that Dr. Birx talks about.
And I want to be clear about — about this group, is that it doesn’t matter where you are.  I just took one of the largest labs, and I said, “Map out for me where you are, within 10 miles of where you are, every site in the country.”  And when you do that, within 10 miles of a site of one of these, 93 percent of the U.S. population is covered.
These are truly national reference labs that cover almost everybody within the United States.  So if you cannot get a test at your hospital, the chances are overwhelming that you could send this to these labs that are fully caught up now.  They have no backlog of tests.  They’ve ramped up their production, so their turnaround time is about 48 hours — because you may need to transport it from the middle of America, out to a lab, and result that.  But that’s really very, very, very good.
The American Hospital Association and also academic labs — as the Vice President and the President have said, as more and more labs come online, they’re increasing the amount of testing that are done just at the hospitals or at academic medical centers — now almost at 600,000 tests.
And again, matching the other slide, I had the Abbott point-of-care tests — just to give you a distribution — and that point-of-care test is being used, very importantly, in very select populations where a point-of-care test is really needed.  That could be in some hospitals, where someone needs to know exactly if a person is positive or not to go on a clinical trial, or in a nursing home investigation, or sometimes to get people screened to go back into the work environment.
Most people don’t need a point-of-care test.  In fact, a point-of-care test does not — cannot replace the millions of tests that are here on the other slide.
Next slide.
I don’t know how interested you are in swabs.  I did not know a whole lot of swabs before a few weeks ago.  But there’s two points I want to make with these slides — is, yes, there have been constraining elements, and they’re constrained for a couple reasons.  Number one, because this is an unprecedented scale-up of this type of very sophisticated molecular tests that has never put a demand on the system like we have.  When we started out a few weeks ago, there’s very specific, one type of swab; only get it one place in the U.S., one place in Italy.  And we were stuck with that for a while because it’s not just the quantity, it’s the quality.
What I don’t want to do is put a lot of things in the system to make people believe that this is a good test, when it hasn’t been validated by the FDA, to say that a positive is a positive and a negative is a negative.  But over the past weeks, both the scientific community, the Gates Foundation, academic medical centers, the FDA, have really opened up our ability to not stick that all the way back in your nasal pharynx, but do the anterior nose, and to greatly broaden the amount of swab types that are available.
So we are really at a point, right now, that over the next — by the end of April, will put another 5 million swabs, in addition to everything that’s out there now, and, by the end of May, over 12 million new swabs in the system — more than enough to obtain the capacity that we need.
Next slide.
For these molecular tests, you take a swab and you stick it in a test tube, and that test tube has to have a specific kind of liquid in it.  And when we started, it was viral transport media — a very special kind of media.  The CDC has a “make your own recipe.”  If you’re interested in cooking, you could probably do that, but it has a lot of ingredients that go in there, but still very limiting.
We’ve worked with many, many different laboratories.  We’ve worked with the FDA.  So now, PBS, phosphate-buffered saline — a, kind of, just laboratory-grade saltwater — can be used for this.  This greatly opens the ability to expand the test to support all the capability that Dr. Birx talks about.
And again, by the end of April, we will have put well over 5 million new tubes of either viral transport media or saline into the system.
I am going to get to a conclusion here, but this was going to be more of a technical briefing.
Next slide.
So let’s talk about the fact that the science tells us that we have and will continue to have enough tests to safely go into phase one.  So let me be very granular about this: We’ve already heard that it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day.  It’s — it’s just not possible.  But it’s also a bad strategy because testing a person now just means they’re negative now.  Dr. Fauci could be positive tomorrow, because it’s brewing in his system right now and we don’t know it, or that he contacts that.  That’s not the way we go about things.
The way we go about things, as Dr. Redfield said, just — just think of the weather radar, okay?  If the weather radar is clear, you’re not going to have a thunderstorm or a tornado.  When something pops up, that’s when you’ve got to go to where the action is or know that your warning system is up.  So, sort of, think of that in the background, and I’ll go specifically about that.  So that’s monitoring.
Let me talk about how much testing we need, just for overall testing.  I’m just going to give you a number; I’m not saying that this is the number that’s there.  But let’s just take a number that we are going to enter phase one when there are 200,000 new cases per month in the United States.  Don’t get hung up on that — it’s going to be much less than that — but let’s just say 200,000 cases.  So, how many tests do we need?
Well, we need to test those 200,000 people to make the diagnosis, right?  Everybody nod your head about that.  We have to do that.  Now, what’s a safe number over that?  You know, if everybody I test has the disease, I’m not testing enough, right? But if I test 100 people to have 1 person with the disease, that’s probably over-testing.
So we kind of assume that a safe number that really gives us a good idea is if about 1 out of 10 people are positive, then we know we’re over-sampling the population enough that we’re getting all the positives.  So if there’s 200,000 cases, I need about 2 million tests.  Okay?
Now, to go to Dr. Redfield’s point, each one of those that are positive have contacts that need to be traced.  And on average, the CDC tells me that for every positive, there are about five contacts that really need to be traced.  So let’s assume that those 200,000 people have five contacts.  So now we have an extra million tests.
So 2 million tests out there to detect the 200,000 cases, an extra million out there to trace those contacts.  So we’re up to about 3 million cases.  If you want to put a fudge factor — say there’s 4 million tests, okay?
Those are generally done at the main hospital labs, the commercial labs, state and regional labs.  All this can be done — as well as some of the labs talked about by Dr. Birx.
Next slide.
The second group of testing fits exactly perfectly with the influenza-like surveillance system that Dr. Redfield talked about.  This is the monitoring.  This is, sort of, the radar — the weather radar that it would be out there — that we’re not testing people who are symptomatic.  We want to do testing on people who are asymptomatic because you can have asymptomatic carriage.  You know, you could have this virus and shed it, and not have symptoms or only mild symptoms.
So what is the strategy here?  The strategy here — this is an unprecedented strategy, okay?  This is — this is really unprecedented.  But we’re going to do, prob- — between three- and five hundred tests per week in the most vulnerable populations that we know that the virus could circulate.
And what are they?  Number one, nursing home and long-term care facilities.  We know that from the history of this — of this virus, that that can circulate and be devastating.  And it could circulate even in a way that you don’t have symptoms.  So we’re going to survey, in a very controlled way, driven by the CDC, supervised by the CDC, surveys over — we may not get to everyone, but surveying in the areas to cover, in a selective way, the 15,000 or so nursing homes.
Secondly, we want to work in vulnerable members in cities. And this is — the way we think about that is community health centers.  I’m a huge fan of community health centers that are led by HRSA.  There are there are about 30,000 community health center sites.  They take care of 30 million people — children, adults, elderly.  They care for about one third of Americans below the poverty level.  They are arrayed to take care of our most vulnerable populations.  So we want to survey asymptomatic people in those community health centers.
We also want to do in some of our indigenous population. And you know, very early, I was out here bringing machines to the Indian Health Service.  And, in fact, 1,800 members of the Public Health Service provide care to the Indian Health Service, and their Director and Chief Medical Officer are both admirals in the Indian Health Service.
Plus, workplace monitoring, particularly for workplace environments that may have very close contact or may have a high risk.  And some of those could be agricultural facilities.
So let’s just total that up.  We have 200,000 people who need a diagnosis.  To make that diagnosis, we want to test 2 million.  Okay?  So that’s 2 million.  We’re going to contact trace with a million.  And let’s just throw you a fudge factor of about 25 percent on that; so that’s 4 million.  And we have this background testing of about 400 — of about 400,000 per month.
So to safely do the testing, we need to be in the range of four and a half million — you followed my numbers, because I want you to understand — per month that —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  For phase one.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Pardon me?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  For phase one.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  For phase one.  Right.  For phase one.  And I want to tell you that’s really how it adds up, and that’s where we are.  Right now, we’re doing about 1 million to 1.2 million per week.  We’re going to continue to push that farther and further, as we open up the laboratories and we’re able to open all the supplies that we need for that.
And I think that’s where I would like to end.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you.  I’ll ask the team to step back up for questions.  And we do anticipate, as his schedule permitted, that the President be returning momentarily.

6:06 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Our nation is engaged in a historic battle against the invisible enemy.  To win this fight, we have undertaken the greatest national mobilization since World War Two.  And that’s exactly what it’s been.
We’ve marshaled every instrument of American power, and we’ve unleashed our most potent weapon of all: the courage of the American people.
These have been trying times.  A cruel virus from a distant land has unfairly claimed thousands of precious American lives.  To every citizen who has lost a cherished loved one: Your pain is our pain.  We mourn as one national family.  Our country has come together.  We draw solace from the faith that God has received, and the departed — He has taken the departed into his eternal and loving embrace.  They will never be forgotten.
Over the last weeks and months, millions of Americans have joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt the spread of this horrible disease.  The Army built field hospitals and sports arenas and convention centers.  The Army Corps of Engineers is great.  Over 20,000 beds in record time.
The Navy sailed hospital ships to our biggest cities.  Lifesaving supplies and experimental medicines were rushed to the frontlines as we launched a rapid search for groundbreaking treatments and vaccines.
We built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world, and we’ve done more testing than any country anywhere in the world.
We suspended dangerous foreign travel.  We leveraged our industrial base to produce vast quantities of critical medical gear and enacted a historic 2-trillion-dollar relief package.
Through it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before — these are our warriors — the bravery of our truck drivers — such bravery — and food suppliers — such incredible bravery, and the determination and drive of our citizens.  Through this unified national endeavor, we have made great progress.  You could really say incredible progress.
Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.  Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million U.S. deaths — if there was no mitigation, it could have even been higher than that — and between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation.  It’s looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers.
Thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection.  But there is no such thing as an optimistic projection on death.  One person is too many.
Our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us.  Nationwide, more than 850 counties, or nearly 30 percent of our country, have reported no new cases in the last seven days.
Because of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of healthcare rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen many other nations — nations which, wherever possible, we are helping.  In America, no person who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator.  We’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators.  We’ve delivered thousands and thousands of ventilators to the states.
And actually, it’s been an incredible operation.  We started with very little and we ended with a lot.  The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.
Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we’re calling, “Opening Up America Again.”  And that’s what we’re doing: We’re opening up our country.  And we have to do that.  America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.
As I have said for some time now, a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.  To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy.  Over the long haul, you can’t do one without the other.  It cannot be done.  To keep vital supply chains running, these chains have to be taken care of so delicately.  They’re delicate.  The balance is delicate.
We want to deliver food and medical supply.  We must have a working economy.  And we want to get it back very, very quickly, and that’s what’s going to happen.  I believe it will boom.
A prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health.  This includes a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing.  Moreover, many patients have put needed medical care on hold, creating entirely new hazards for public health.
Our country has suffered.  The world has suffered.  One hundred and eighty-four other countries have suffered.
Therefore, my administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states.  I’ve dealt with them now a long time, and we’ve had a great relationship — Democrat, Republican.  The relationship has been good.  This strategy is based on hard, verifiable data.
I want to thank Dr. Birx for her incredible leadership in crafting these guidelines in consultation with scientists, experts, and medical professionals across government.  Dr. Birx will explain the guidelines in more detail in a few moments.  And Dr. Fauci has been absolutely terrific.  We’ve all worked together, and we’ve worked together well.
They are interested in the health of our country.  And we’re all interested in the viability and making us truly great again.  We took the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we closed it in order to win this war.  And we’re in the process of winning it now.
Our approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life.  We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time.  And some states will be able to open up sooner than others.  Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in.
Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again, we’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.
Our strategy will continue to protect senior citizens and other vulnerable populations while allowing military and other groups of incredibly talented people to go about their real business and the business that’s supposed to be hard at work at doing.  And nobody does it better.  Our military is the greatest anywhere in the world, and we’re so thankful for what they’ve done.
Healthy Americans will now be able to return to work as conditions on the ground allow.  Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest-risk individuals.  So important.  We’re establishing clear scientific, metric, and — benchmarks on testing, new case growth, and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase.  And that’s each phase specifically in the reopening of our country.
This is a gradual process.  As the caseload in a state continues to go down, restrictions can continue to be eased and come off.  Throughout the process, citizens will continue to be called upon to use all of their weapons in this war: vigorous hygiene, teleworking when possible, staying at home if you feel sick, maintaining social distance, sanitizing commonly used surfaces, and being highly conscious of their surroundings.  Those are our weapons, and they’re very powerful weapons indeed.
Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states.  Every state is very different.  They’re all beautiful.  We love them all.  But they’re very, very different.  If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that.  And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task — and very, very quickly — depending on what they want to do.
We are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts.  We’ll have numerous cases where states have worked and will be working very, very closely together.
As we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead.  Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly.  If the virus returns in the fall, as some scientists think it may possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.
At the heart of our strategy is the vital role of medical research, especially for therapies that will significantly improve outcomes for high-risk patients and reduce the need for urgent care.  This will be tremendously valuable in allowing life to eventually return to normal.  At least 35 clinical trials are already underway, including antiviral therapies, immune therapies, and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma.  You’ve all heard about some of these events and some of these therapies.  They’ve come a long way.  What’s been done in the last four weeks is incredible.
We will also continue to expand our testing capacity.  We have now completed more than 3.5 million tests — by far the most anywhere in the world.  Areas of our country that have been hotspots have done much more testing, on a per capita basis, than South Korea.  We’ve done more than South Korea — and South Korea has done a good job, but we’ve done more.
We will continue to work with governors to advise them on how to conduct both surveillance and diagnostic testing.  We have now distributed over 600,000 Abbott ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic tests.  These are tests that are done on site, and, within five minutes, you know the answer: positive or negative.
In recent days, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests performed by hospitals and academic institutions, with more than 120,000 tests recently reported in a single day — far more than any country in the world has ever been able to do.  And our numbers are actually going up.
As these new and better testing solutions come online, we’re seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers.  For this reason, the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100,000 to roughly 75,000 tests over the last week.  The reason it dropped is because we have so many other tests and we don’t even have to go through the laboratories.  But the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity, and states feel free to use that capacity.
Some in the media falsely reported this as a bad thing, when, in fact, it is a great thing because it indicates that the states are moving to faster, more local testing solutions, including on-the-spot tests.
So this drop in the utilization of commercial laboratories is an affirmation that testing, which is at an all-time high, is growing at a historic rate.  In other words, the laboratories are great, but now we have forms of testing that are much quicker, much better, and we don’t have to use the laboratories.  But they’re there, and they have a great capacity to do the work.
As Dr. Birx has been advising our governors for weeks, we continue to have an excess testing capacity of 1 million tests per week available for use.  And our capabilities are growing every single day, especially with the new tests that are coming onto the market rapidly.
As we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad.  Border control, travel restrictions, and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work.
The sacrifices our citizens have made in this time of crisis will be remembered, studied, honored, and praised for generations to come.  We’re really all working together.  Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal — we’re all working together.  This is not about parties; this is about our country.
Now the American people are ready to rise to the occasion once again.  They are ready to show the world once more that Americans can defeat any challenger.  Together, we will rebuild this land that we love, we will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share, and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory.
I would now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Birx to further explain the new guidelines.  I want to thank Dr. Birx.  I want to thank Dr. Fauci.  And I want to thank, really especially, a man who has devoted 24 hours a day to his task force and done such an incredible job — our great Vice President, Mike Pence.
Please, Mike.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force today joined the President to meet with a bipartisan group of members of the House and of the Senate to get their counsel on the development of what the President unveiled to America’s governors this afternoon.
The new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again” are a product of the best science and the best common sense that the President has marshaled on this team and from a broad range of advisors from all across the nation.
From the moment President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force, early on he made it clear that we have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.
The President launched a whole-of-government approach.  And while we stand here, on this day, with more than 640,000 Americans having contracted the coronavirus — and our hearts go out to the families of the more than 31,000 Americans who lost their lives and those who continue to struggle with serious consequences of the coronavirus — the truth is that because of the decisive action that our President took early on, suspending travel from China and thereafter from portions of Europe and South Korea; screening passengers; because of the strong actions in partnership with every governor across America; because of the extraordinary efforts of America’s healthcare workers on the frontlines; and because of the cooperation of the American people and God’s grace, we are slowing the spread, we are flattening the curve, we have preserved the capacity of our healthcare system, and we’ve protected the most vulnerable.
In a word, because of the actions of this President, this administration, governors at every level, our healthcare workers, and our fellow Americans, we’ve saved lives.  And every American should be comforted by that.
And we can see it in the numbers, in the charts that I’ll present today.  These three maps track influenza-like illness, which, in this instance, is mostly coronavirus across America.  The first map reflects the total number of cases on the week ending March the 28th.  The next map reflects our data about the total number of cases on the week ending April 4.  And we stand here today with the final map reflecting the total number of cases across America, as of April the 11th.
With these trends underway, President Trump tasked the White House Coronavirus Task Force to develop new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again.”  Those guidelines were presented today — first, to our nation’s governors.  And it is our intention, at the President’s direction, to provide these guidelines to assist governors and state health officials in evaluating the most responsible manner to reopen the economies of their states at a time and manner of their choosing.
The guidelines, as Americans who are looking on will note, begin with what is the best criteria that our experts have developed — a downward trajectory in cases over a 14-day period of time — ensuring that states have proper capacity in their healthcare facilities.
The second set of proposals includes a description of recommendations for state preparedness.  And let me say to the American people what President Trump made clear to our governors today: that our administration will continue to work day in and day out — through our task force, through FEMA — to ensure that our states have not only the medical supplies, but that we continue to rapidly expand testing across the nation.
The President reflected on the progress we’ve made on testing, but a few statistics for that as well, which I hope are an encouragement to the American people.  On March 11, we had performed a total of 23,588 tests.  Because of the public-private partnership that President Trump initiated with commercial labs across the country, that number was 83,500 by March 18.  And as the President just said, that number is 3.5 million today.  It is our expectation that we will have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of the month of April, and we’ll continue to scale those resources.
So, testing and medical supplies will continue to be an ongoing partnership with our states, and we want our healthcare workers and people all across the country to know of our commitment to that.
Finally, the President directed us to propose a phased approach to reopening — to reopening our economy.  It is based on up-to-date data and readiness, and we’ll continue to provide the very best data to our states, working with their health officials.
The focus is on the mitigation of any risk of resurgence or the emergence of the coronavirus in states where it’s not yet emerged.  There is a focus in the President’s new guidelines on the most vulnerable.
And it’s — we made this very clear to the governors today: These new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again” can be implemented on a statewide basis or on a county-by-county basis.
With that, I’m happy to turn it over to Dr. Deborah Birx and, if I may, Mr. President, I’d like to also extend my admiration and appreciation to Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and every member of our task force that worked around the clock to develop these recommendations for opening up America.  I know every American is grateful for your leadership and for theirs.
Deborah.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  We’re going to go through these quickly because I know you have them, and many of you have already spoken to them on television.
Next slide, please.
This is a very important slide.  It talks about the gatekeeping — on the gatekeeping criteria to moving into phase one.  It’s very much related to what you just saw about influenza-like illness.  And the United States has been tracking influenza-like illnesses through the Centers of Disease Control for years.
Both the state and public health officials are used to watching this, county health officials are used to watching it, and frankly, every family around the United States knows how to access this on the CDC website in order to get update — up-to-date information to the communities.
It also looks at a syndromic emergency room-type visits — again, housed at the CDC — and really is our surveillance program that can be utilized for a lot of different illnesses, but in this case, will be utilized for respiratory diseases.
In addition, we are tracking the number of cases, and it must have a downward trajectory for 14 days — as well as the influenza-like illness and the syndromic illnesses — and a downward trajectory in the number of positive tests with persistence of high levels of testing.
For the hospitals, it’s to ensure that we can treat all patients without resorting to any crisis care and ensuring that there’s a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including frontline responders with the emerging antibody tests.
Next slide.
Now, just to show you what this looks like: So what the CDC did for me, under the direction of Bob Redfield, was to chart what would the syndromic illnesses were reporting throughout the early part of March.  And you can see, in New Orleans, respiratory diseases were starting to be seen in the emergency room.  That is the red line.  The cases are shown in the dark blue line.  The gray mountain is testing, and underneath that is the blue mountain of positives.  And you can see that the early alert was present from the emergency room about early respiratory disease.  You can see it predated the cases.
So, throughout the summer, when we do not have flu to contaminate this picture, we’ll be able to follow this syndromic pattern city by city, county by county, community by community, state by state.
Next slide.
In addition, the CDC has the influenza-like illness net distributed throughout the United States — very useful in the wintertime.  That first peak is influenza B in the red; that’s this season.  I showed you all the seasons here so you could see the seasons as they are displayed.
The first peak is influenza B, second peak influenza A.  And then you can see the coronavirus.  And you can see its decline, and it’s declining towards the baseline.  This will allow us — again, city by city, community by community, state by state — to look for variations and an early response mode in those localities that I described.
Next slide.
So hopefully you see that we’ve brought CDC and their amazing talent of individuals at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and all of their abilities to this response and also to the surveillance that we need in this response.
But I want to call your attention to the third bullet on this graphic.  So we’re tracking those two pieces that I described.  But the third bullet is about setting up sentinel surveillance sites to be able to distinguish and find asymptomatic individuals — individuals that you have heard about that may be either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic throughout their entire disease course.  We want to be able to find them in communities of particular vulnerability.
So we’ll be doing sentinel surveillance throughout nursing homes, throughout inner-city federal clinics, throughout indigenous populations, to really be able to find early alerts of asymptomatic individuals in the community.  And both for the syndromic cases that are tested, the influenza-like cases, and the asymptomatic cases: doing contact tracing, again, with support from the Centers for Disease Control, working with each state and local government.
In addition, we want to make sure that all the healthcare facilities have adequate protective — personal protective devices and the equipment to handle the surge and to ensure the ICUs can handle increased capacity.
We want every state to have a plan for the health and safety of its workers in critical industries, and to protect the health and safety of those living in high-risk facilities, including senior care facilities, as we discussed with sentinel surveillance but also additional surveillance.
When we talked with all of the states that had not had a major metro outbreak, their sentinel surveillances picked up, always, the first cases in nursing homes.  And so this is very much a big focus of the plan moving forward.  I won’t go into the rest of the details on this slide, but there’s quite a bit of details on the expectations of every state and local government.
Next slide.
You’ll recognize this slide, it’s a — next slide, please.  You’ll recognize this slide; it’s what we’ve been talking about in the 15 and 30 days to prevent the spread.  It’s continuing those critical handwashing or sanitizer; avoiding touching your face at all times; disinfecting surfaces; using face covering while in public; following state and local guidelines; and, critically, staying home if you are sick.
I know a lot of people go to the workplace when they are feeling ill.  You know when you’re feeling ill.  It won’t get better by going to work.  So we’re asking again for people to stay home when they’re sick.
Next slide is for employers to ensure that there can be social distancing and protective equipment; temperature checks; use of disinfectant in high-traffic areas, including break rooms; and ensuring that we don’t do — there’s no non-essential business travel; and then monitoring for any symptomatic individuals in the workplace.  And again, if you come — become ill at work, to immediately to go home and ensure that there’s contact tracing of all the individuals that become sick.
I’m going to go through the phases very quickly, but you have the details.
Phase one: Again, you have to go through those gating criterias related to 14 days of decreasing evidence of illness and decreasing testing, despite adequate testing.  So phase one begins with all vulnerable individuals, including those with comorbidities continuing to shelter in place and ensuring that those — the first to go out into the public are not those that are most vulnerable to bad outcomes in this disease.  And then ensuring that we continue to do six-feet maximum physical distancing in public spaces, continuing to avoid large gatherings and all non-essential travel.
For the employers — next slide — again, if a vulnerable population needs to return to work and cannot be teleworking, there should be special accommodations for all vulnerable populations, as well as options for teleworking.  We believe every employee should encourage work return in phases: from 20 percent or 25 percent, to 40 percent, to 50 percent.  And again, minimize all non-essential travel.
Phase one continued — next slide.  If the schools are already closed, they should remain closed.  All visits to senior living facilities and hospitals should be continued to be prohibited.  Large venues, including sit-down dining, can only be operated under strict physical distancing protocols and maintaining those six feet.  Gyms could open if they, again, adhere to strict physical distancing.  And elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient basis.
Phase two — next slide.  Next slide.  Again, you have to go through the criteria, again, of a continuation of another 14-day decline among those criterias that were in the gating.  Again, we’re asking for all vulnerable individuals: Shelter in place.
We did not put a timeline on any of the phases.  We want the governors, with the data that they have, community by community, to be setting up those timelines.  Again, we’re asking for the public to continue to maximize physical distance; however, we increased social settings to be able to now have 50 individuals, and non-essential travel can resume.
Next slide.
This is for the employers.  We still would like to encourage telework, and the common areas should remain closed or be physically distant.  All non-essential travel for employees can resume.  And then, again, special accommodations for vulnerable.
Next slide.
This should be a relief to many of — households that have small children.  Schools, daycares, and camps can reopen in phase two.  Visits to senior-living facilities, however, should remain — and hospitals — prohibited.  Large venues can operate but solely under moderate physical distancing.  And elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient and inpatient basis.
Phase three: And so phase three — I won’t go through in detail — it’s essentially returning to our new normal, with all of what we talked about through all phases: continuing the good hygiene practices, continuing the respect for spaces between individuals, because we know that we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread.
I do believe with this plan that we’re both confronting the issue of finding symptomatic individuals through our networks with early alert, as well as those who come and present to different hospitals and emergency room with testing and contact tracing, but critically have put in place what we believe is a safety net through asymptomatic sentinel surveillance that is centered around our most vulnerable groups — between nursing homes and our Native American people and indigenous populations, and our inner city groups that we know may be in multi-generational households and have unique risk.
I’ll stop there, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Please, Tony.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  So as you’ve seen just now from the detailed presentation from Dr. Birx, this is a rather robust program for re-entering into normality.
There’s a lot of details here, and I know it’ll take a little bit of time to digest them all.  So what I thought would be good, since I really want to be brief to allow time for questions, is to kind of take us back to the discussions that we’ve had here before and why this is a natural evolution from what we had said before.
You might recall that, on a few occasions when I was up here before you, I told you that when we get to the point where we’re going to take those steps towards trying to get back to some form of normality, that it would not be a light switch that you could turn on and off.  I meant that in two different components.
First of all, that we are a very large country and we have different dynamics in the country.  We have areas of the country that have gone through a terrible ordeal, and others that fortunately have gone and gotten — gotten through this rather lightly.  So that’s the first thing.
The second thing is that light switch, on and off, is the exact opposite of what you see here, which is a gradual gradation.  But the first thing and the only thing in mind, as the health people here — and my colleagues, who are either physicians, scientists, or public health issues — the predominant and completely driving element that we put into this was the safety and the health of the American public.
And I know there are a lot of other considerations that go into opening — considerations that you’ve heard of right from this podium.  But the dominating drive of this was to make sure that this is done in the safest way possible.
So let me just make a couple of comments to just reiterate more, from a broader standpoint, the things that Dr. Birx did so well in a very a granular detail.
First of all, in order to even consider getting into the phasing, you have to pass a hurdle.  And that’s the hurdle that we refer to as “gating in.”  Now, when you think about it and look at the map of the country and look at the differences in different parts of the country, you will see that there are some regions, states, locations that are going to be almost already into some of that gating, and will have already fulfilled some of those criteria.  Others, because of the dynamics of the outbreak in the area, will take longer to be able to do that.  But you don’t get to phase one until you get through the gating.
And then in order to make sure that safety and health is the dominant issue, the design of the phases were just that.  You go into phase one.  If you get no rebound and you satisfy the gating for yet again a second time, then you go to phase two.  If you have no rebound and you satisfy the gating criteria for a third time, you go into phase three.  So there are multiple checkpoints of safety there.
So as I’ve said, from this podium, when we were talking about the first 15 days of the mitigation and then we extended it another 30 days, I essentially pleaded with the American public to say, “Let us make sure we do the best that we can to accomplish that.”
And, in fact, mitigation works.  You saw the charts that the Vice President and that Dr. Birx put up.  It worked.  And what we hope and I believe we will be successful: If we carefully do this — again, with the attention to the safety and health of the American public — that we will be able to — and it will be staggered.  Not every state, not every region is going to do it at the same time; that’s clearly obvious because of the very dynamics of the outbreak.
But we feel confident that, sooner or later, we will get to the point — hopefully sooner, with safety as the most important thing — to a point where we can get back to some form of normality.
The one thing I liked about it that — that Dr. Birx said so well — is that no matter what phase you’re in, there are certain fundamental things that we’ve done that are not like it was in September and October.  You want to call it the “new normal” — you can call it whatever you want.  But even if you are in phase one, two, three, it’s not, “Okay, game over.”  It’s not.  It’s going to be a way that we protect ourselves because, as we know, and as I’ve said from this podium, it may very well be — as we go the cycle around — that there’ll be this virus that wants to come back to us.

5:49 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Please.  Thank you.  A big day today at the White House.  All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy.  While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working — and very strongly working, I might add.
New cases are declining throughout the New York metropolitan area.  Cases in the Detroit and Denver metro areas are flat.  Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and St. Louis are showing great signs of progress, and new cases in Houston and New Orleans are declining.
The battle continues, but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases.  Hopefully that will continue and we will continue to make great progress.
These encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we’ll be announcing.  We’re going to be talking about that tomorrow.  We’ll be having a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon.  We’re going to be announcing guidelines, and we’ll be talking about various states.  And it’s very exciting.
It’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world.  The greatest.  There’s never been an economy like what we had produced, but we’ll produce it again.  And I think we’ll produce it again very fast.
The medical and healthcare advances we’ve made are critical to our continued progress.  We’ve rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests.  To date, we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further.
Today, Abbott Labs announced that it has developed an antibody test that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity.  It’s a great test.  The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks.
My administration is also distributing vast amounts of medical supplies to states across the country through Project Air Bridge, which has been an amazing success.  We have completed 44 flights — and these are flights of very, very large airplanes, massive cargo planes — 44 flights of critical supplies as of today and an additional 56 flights scheduled in the near future.  We have some very brilliant people working on this.  It’s logistically incredible what they’ve done.  And we’ve also been working on this with the military.  And these people have been — the genius of all of them together, it has been incredible to watch.
In total, through all channels, the federal government has developed and delivered 39.4 million N95 masks, 431 million gloves, 57 million surgical masks, and 10.2 million gowns.  We ordered 500 million masks, and they’ll be coming shortly.  And we’ve distributed 100 million masks.
Following our use of the Defense Production Act, GM announced that its first ventilators come off the assembly line in Kokomo, Indiana — a great place.  They did it in 11 days, from start to finish, a remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the American worker.  GM will ship over 600 ventilators this month alone, with thousands more to come.  And we have other companies doing something similar.
And I think they said that there’s a brief clip that we have of General Motors, sent to us by General Motors.  And I think they might be wanting to play that for your benefit.  Please.
(A video is played.)
I know you got a little bit nervous when you saw there was a clip about ready to be played, but that was sent to us by General Motors, and we thought it would be a good one to play.  It’s amazing.  It’s — you know, what they’ve done in a very, very short period of time.
They’re now making thousands of ventilators, and they’re coming out of the factory very rapidly, at a clip that nobody can even believe.  But we have others also doing it.  And these are very high-grade ventilators.  So we’re helping a lot of people.  And at this moment, nobody needs them.  We have to remember, during the surge, nobody has needed him for weeks now.
But we’ll have them for stockpiles, and very importantly, we’re going to have them for other countries because nobody is able to do things like we can do.  And we’re going to be able to help other countries that are having tremendous problems, to put it mildly.
My administration is using every available authority to accelerate the development, study, and delivery of therapies — so important, therapies — treatments, and ultimately, what we want to come up with is a safe vaccine.  But frankly, the therapies, to me, are the most important because it takes care of people right now.  The vaccines have to be tested, so it takes a longer period of time.  But we have some great potential therapies already, and we’ll see how they’re working.  We’ll be able to report on that, I think, over the next week or two.  Tremendous progress has been made.
At least 35 clinical trials of promising therapies are now underway.  So 35 different genius companies.  If you look at AIDS, if you look at Ebola, if you look at so many things, they’ve come up with the answers to so many things, you wouldn’t have believed it.  And we’re very honored to be working with them.
They include antivirals, and also — and they — something which is incredible: It keeps the virus from multiplying.  A mechanism that keeps the virus from multiplying.  Immune therapies that prevent the immune system from overreaching to the virus.  And convalescent plasma treatments that use antibodies from the blood of recovered patients.
And we have a lot of patients who recover, and they’re so happy to have recovered that the first thing they do is say, “We want to give our blood.”  And they do that.  It’s incredible.  We have thousands of people that are doing that.  They recover and they feel they have an obligation because they’ve gotten such great care.  And a lot of them didn’t think they were going to make it.
As the entire U.S. government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that the key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed.  And we’re not allowing that to take place through our Congress.  They’re just not — they’re just not giving it to us.  We have many, many positions that are unstaffed because we can’t get the approvals.  The Democrats are holding us up.  We cannot get approval.
We’ve gotten judges because we go through the process.  I guess we’re up to 448 federal judges.  And that, we’ve gotten because we focus on it; we take the maximum time.  Because no matter who the judge is, they take vast numbers of days and hours to approve, and it leaves no time left for others.  Very unfair system.
If a judge is going to be approved in one hour, in one session, it doesn’t matter — they’ll take the maximum number of hours and days — you’re talking about days — to get one judge approved.  And we’re close to 250 judges, but because of the way they’re doing it, there’s no time for anybody else.  And many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years.  We have a couple that have been waiting for longer than that.
There are currently 129 nominees stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction.  Many are nominated for vacancies that must be filled to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the resulting economic challenges.  And I’ve read, over the last couple of years, “Well, I didn’t fill positions.”  I don’t fill positions — in some cases, we don’t need the position, and I’m all for that.  But in many cases, you do, but we can’t get them approved by the Democrats.  They won’t release them.
The positions include the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets of the United States, and the Undersecretary of Agriculture responsible for administering food security programs.  And Sonny Perdue, who’s going to be speaking today, is saying, “Please, can I have this man, can I have this particular person approved as soon as possible?”  He’s been telling me that for a long time, and the Democrats won’t allow it to happen.
Again, every single judge, every nominee we have goes through maximum, or at least they go through a long process.  So it takes days and days, and there’s no time left.  And it’s just a concerted effort to make life difficult.
An example is Michael Pack.  He’s my nominee for the CEO of the Broadcasking [sic] — Broadcasting Board of Governors.  And he’s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America.  Very important.
And if you heard what’s coming out of the Voice of America, it’s disgusting.  What — things they say are disgusting toward our country.  And Michael Pack would get in and he’d do a great job, but he’s been waiting now for two years.  Can’t get him approved.
The senators left Washington until at least May 4th.  The Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances — the “recess appointment,” it’s called — the Senate’s practice of dabbling into so-called pro forma sessions where no one is even there.  It has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that we’re giving — that we’re given under the recess provisions.
The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments.  We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government — and now more so than ever before, because of the virus and the problem.  We have to do it, and we have to do whatever we have to do.  They’ve made it very, very difficult to run government.  I don’t think any administration has done anywhere near what we’ve done in three and a half years.
But every block — every week, they put up roadblocks, whether it’s “Russia, Russia, Russia,” or whether it’s impeachment hoax, or whatever it may be.  It’s always roadblocks and a waste of time.
If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.  The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis.  It is a scam, what they do.  It’s a scam, and everybody knows it.  And it’s been that way for a long time.  And perhaps it’s never done before — it’s never been done before; nobody is even sure if it has.  But we’re going to do it.  We need these people here.  We need people for this crisis, and we don’t want to play any more political games.
I’ve been waiting for two and a half years, three years, for some of these people.  And they’re great people.  They left law firms.  They left jobs.  They gave up everything to do it.  And they’ve been waiting for three years, two and a half years, two years, one year to get approved.  It’s ridiculous.  And everyone knows they’re going to be approved.  But there’s only so many hours in the day, when you go through judges and you go through a lengthy hearings on judges that they know should be approved immediately.  And they could do it in one session, one — and they could do it in one hour.  And instead, it takes them many days.
In order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nations, as we announced yesterday, the U.S. government has put a hold on funding to the WHO — World Health Organization — pending a review of the organization’s cover-up and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak.  Over the objections of the WHO, we took decisive action and early lifesaving action to suspend travel from China.  They didn’t want to do it.  They were angry that we did it.  It was early on.  They were angry that we did it.  Took them a long time to realize what was going on, but I have a feeling they know exactly what was going on.
Tragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn’t do any form of ban.  And you see what happened to Italy.  You see what happened to Spain.  You see what happened to France.  WHO’s guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world.  That was a horrible, tragic mistake — or perhaps they knew.  I’m sure they didn’t know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew.  Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense.
To ease the economic pain of millions of American families, we’ve now processed $300 billion in loans to more than 1 million small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program.  This action has saved millions of American jobs.  It’s been an incredible success.  And they want to replenish it now, but, again, the Democrats don’t want to do that.  This is money that goes to the workers of our country.
Phase one was $350 billion dollars.  And now phase two, we want to do $250 billion.  This goes to workers and it goes to small businesses so we can save all the small businesses around our nation.
Mike McFarland from Nebraska recently said this historic relief has been a godsend for his small factory, and the 136 Americans who work there.  He saved those jobs.  Another small business owner, Tim Miller from Oklahoma, called the program a total lifesaver for his auto-repair shop’s four employees.  Stories like these underscore why Congress must replenish the Paycheck Protection Program immediately.  The Republicans want to do it; they want to do it immediately.  They want to do it now.  And the Democrats are stopping it.
A short time ago, CDC issued public health guidelines for critical industries.  In a few moments, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue will elaborate on how these guidelines apply to our nation’s dedicated workers in the food processing profession — because it’s a profession.  It’s incredible what they do: food processing.  And they’re keeping our grocery stores full.  The shelves are not bare like the shelves that I inherited when we took over the stockpile — the medical stockpile, where the shelves were bare.  “The cupboard was bare,” I say.
Tomorrow, I’ll also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed.  And we really think, with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we’re going to have an economy that really comes back quickly.  And we’d like to see it more than match what we had before.  What we had before was a miracle.  And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle.  We’re going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world.
We’ll also be speaking to America’s governors tomorrow and then we’ll be announcing exactly what’s happening.  You already know we’ll be opening up states — some states much sooner than others.  And we think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1st.  And I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed.
Governors are looking forward — they’re chomping at the bit to get going.  Again, not all states are the same.  They’re very different.  Some are having very little problems.  Some have done such a good job that they have very little problem and they’re ready to go.  So, Vice President Pence and I will be speaking with the governors tomorrow.  We’ll be discussing procedures.
Today, I spoke with the leaders of many of our nation’s most renowned companies and organizations on how to achieve the full resurgence of the American economy.  My discussions included top leaders in health and healthcare, transportation technology, financial services, food, beverages, hospitality, real estate, retail, agriculture, construction, energy, labor, manufacturing, and sports industries.
We want to get our country open again.  We want to have our sports leagues open.  You want to watch sports.  It’s important.  We miss sports.  We miss everything.  We want to get back.
These experts and innovators provided extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy.  They gave us a lot of great ideas.  We spoke to a lot of very, very smart people — the highest of the high-tech.  The level of I","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-26/

6:14 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Please.  Very importantly, I’d like to begin by saying that we’ve just reached agreement — the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines — to participate in a Payroll Support Program.  This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy, and protect taxpayers.  Our airlines are now in good shape, and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them.
The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus.  We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light.  We see that tunnel.  And at the end of that tunnel, we see light.  We’re starting to see it.
More than ever before, we’ve held our rate, the numbers — everything we’ve done.  We’ve been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it.  You look at what’s happening in other countries — Spain, Italy, United Kingdom.  We’re working with them.  We’re trying to help them, especially with ventilators.  They’ve been calling a lot.  They need ventilators so badly.
Fifteen percent of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases.  Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, “Wow, that looks bad.”  But they don’t have the problem.
I salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing — even you people.  It’s so different looking out there when I look at you.  Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives.
Today I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.  Everybody knows what’s going on there.
American taxpayers provide between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO.  In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less.  As the organization’s leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability.
One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations.  They were very much opposed to what we did.  Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives.  Thousands and thousands of people would have died.
Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved.  Instead, look at the rest of the world.  Look at parts of Europe.  Other nations and regions, who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world.  Many countries said, “We’re going to listen to the WHO,” and they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe.  Nobody can believe.
The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days.  The WHO’s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures.  Travel bans work for the same reason that quarantines work.  Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission.  Border control is fundamental to virus control.
Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world and, most importantly, to help prevent global health crises.  With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America’s generosity has been put to the best use possible.
The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain that and share information in a timely and transparent fashion.
The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it’s not, to independently to tell the world the truth about what is happening.
The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable.  It’s time, after all of these decades.  The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts.  There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate, and investigate immediately.
Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary.  The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency caused valuable time, tremendous amounts of time.  More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts in to examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done.  The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples, to this date, has deprived the scientific community of essential data.
New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis points to the unreliability of the initial reports, and the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality.
The silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors and on new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID-19 in the country of origin is deeply concerning, especially when we put up, by far, the largest amount of money.  Not even close.
Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source, with very little death — very little death — and certainly very little death by comparison.  This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage.
Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency.  I don’t think so.  The WHO pushed China’s misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans.  They told us, when we put on our travel ban — a very strong travel ban — there was no need to do it.  “Don’t do it.”  They actually fought us.
The WHO’s reliance on China’s disclosures likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that.
The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many.
America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions.  If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals.  We’ll have no choice but to do that.
Our countries are now experiencing — you look all over the world — tremendous death and economic devastation because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so.  It would have been so easy to be truthful.  And so much death has been caused by their mistakes.
We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms.  For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others.  All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful lettel [sic] — letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups — medically, politically, and every other way.
And we’ll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners: what do we do with all of that money that goes to WHO.  And maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won’t.  But we’ll be able to see.
As you know, in other countries hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators.  But due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our healthcare workers, and the resilience of our healthcare system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator — with all of the talk you’ve heard, where some states wanted 40,000 ventilators.  I said, “That doesn’t work,” 40,000.  And they ended up with seven or eight thousand, and they had no problem.  Forty thousand ventilators for one state is ridiculous.
The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators.  This is the system we inherited.  I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.
And you look at the states.  The states didn’t have — the states were not prepared.  I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn’t get one would die.  And that’s what we were told: They would die.  I saw another country’s doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn’t.  And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis.  Those that didn’t get ventilators were said to be in a position only of one alternative — and that was death.  Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn’t get them ventilators and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately?  I instructed my team to move Heaven and Earth to make sure that this didn’t happen.
We started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had.  And I got daily updates on the supply we had from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates.  We had a great group of people working on it.
I instructed my team to use the Defense Production Act.  And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully — more powerfully than anybody would know.  In fact, so powerfully that, for the most part, we didn’t have to officially take it out — it was a hammer; it was a very powerful hammer — in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible.
Last year, America manufactured, from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators.  And this year, the number will be over 150,000 ventilators.  It could be as high as 200,000 — far more than we’ll ever need.  So we’ll be able to stockpile.  We’ll be able to talk to states about stockpiling.
These are high-quality ventilators.  We had a choice: We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high-quality.  We’ve done a high-quality ventilator.
So we should have anywhere from 150- to 200,000 ventilators.  In addition to that, we have 10,000 ventilators right now in the federal stockpile ready to move should we need them — we might not — should we need them in New York or New Jersey or in Louisiana or in Illinois or any other state that may need them if we have a surge.
I’d like to ask Adam Boehler to come up and just say a few words.  He’s done a fantastic job — a young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation.  And I’d just like to have — have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words.
Adam, please.  Thank you very much.
MR. BOEHLER:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible.  Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly, with over 100,000 by the end of June.
At the same time, there are over 60,000 ventilators in our hospitals right now that are not in use.  Knowing this and at your direction, we reached out to the American Hospital Association to design a system that allows hospitals to lend ventilators to other hospitals right when they need it.
Within the past week alone, 20 top health systems have signed up for this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, representing over 4,000 ventilators.  Not only do we have top academic systems, like Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, but we also have top health systems from New York City, New Orleans, Washington State, and California.  Over a week ago, these places would have needed help, but now they are here to help.  There’s been no American that has needed a ventilator that has not received one.
This Dynamic Virtual [Ventilator] Reserve, combined with our strategic stockpile will ensure that this is always the case.  I’d like to thank the President for his leadership and directive to focus on public-private partnerships like this one.  I’d also like to thank Sam Hazen from HCA, Lloyd Dean from CommonSpirit for leading this effort with the AHA and the Federation of American Hospitals.
These have been difficult times.  A few weeks ago, the Vice President came into my office and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies.  We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President.
This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Fantastic job.
MR. BOEHLER:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d shake his hand, but I’m not allowed to.  Times have changed, haven’t they?  Thank you very much.  You did a fantastic job.  We’re very proud of you — you and your whole team.  Thank you.
Today, we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available ventilators.  This afternoon, I met with the leaders — the top people of many of America’s big, powerful, beautiful, and, you know, very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today.  We had a great meeting, learned a lot.  And they’ve been going through a lot and they’ve been doing a fantastic job, as everybody here will attest.
I’m pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, so that we’re going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we’re able to help our states with at a later date if there’s ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again.  It was 1917, 1918.  That’s a long time ago.  We hope it never happens again.
And I’d like to ask Rick Pollack, CEO of American Hospital Association; Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare — that’s the largest in the United States; Warner Thomas, CEO of Ochsner Health.  And if I could, Mihal- — you — are you here from Cleveland Clinic?  Somebody?  Good.  Thank you.  Come on up, folks.  Please.
Thank you.  Say a few words please.
MR. POLLACK:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve program.  This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need.
You know, as this battle against this disease has affected the country a little bit unevenly, the rates of infection, hospitalization, and ICU use varies from one region to another.  In some places with lower infection rates, some ventilators may not be in use, while other areas are potentially stretched beyond their capacity.  The database of available ventilators that we are creating will allow us to flex so that we can make sure that available equipment can be shared with those in need.
We appreciate the leadership of the health systems that are here today that has stepped forward.  And Adam mentioned a few — I don’t know if he caught Dr. Fritz Francois from NYU Langone, and David Dill, the CEO of LifePoint, as well.
We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients.  We’ll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further.  Your team has provided us with important leadership, and we look forward to working with you in making this a success.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR. HAZEN:  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team.  I stand here before you, in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country.
One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID-19 battle was to find partnerships — partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and federal.  And we’re proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership, and I think it’s going to do great good for the community.
So thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.
MR. THOMAS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s great to have Ochsner Health be part of this program.  We certainly have been a recipient, and the state of Louisiana has been a recipient of help getting ventilators to our state and Ochsner Health.
We’re currently taking care of about 60 percent of the COVID patients in New Orleans, and we did see a spike over the past few weeks.  But we’re starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction.
I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health a couple weeks ago.  We were running short on surgical gowns, and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us, and other hospitals around the New Orleans area.
So we’re excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, and we are proud to be part of that and help other communities around the country.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
DR. MIHALJEVIC:  Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation here.  On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a COVID pandemic.
In our home state of Ohio, with an early institution of social distancing, our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days.  Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with COVID infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System.
We’re also very grateful for the support from our state government, as well from our federal government.  This is a battle where we’re all in together.  We coordinate our efforts, share our resources, and work together as one.
I’m firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together.  Thank you very much for having us.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
DR. MIHALJEVIC:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job.
That was a terrific meeting.  And thank you all for being here.  Thank you very much.
The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation.  We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is, compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain.  Think of that — 34.7, we have — and 6.6 the UK.  There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not in use at this moment.  They didn’t need them.  We got a lot of them out, and they didn’t need them.  And that’s a good thing that they didn’t need them.
But a lot of good brainpower was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions.  I want to thank our Vice President for the task force.  And I want to thank all members of your task force on having done an incredible job.  You really have done an incredible job.  Thank you, Mike, very much.
Through this new partnership with the hospitals, unused ventilators will voluntarily lend them.  Where they have unused ventilators, they will voluntary lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need.
Within the last several days, more than 20 of our nation’s largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them.  And I’ve been told that if they need more, there are more there.  We’re going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which is — which started, but will really start about less than a month.
We’re going to be helping other countries, and they need it very badly.  They have no chance without these ventilators.  They have to have ventilators.
As we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients.  It’s the first one.  These tests can be self-administered by patients in healthcare settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment.  Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily.
So, by using saliva — that’s a first — they’ll be able to do things, in terms of speed and ease, that we haven’t been able to do before.  So, a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time.  And that’s innovation.  I call it “innovation under pressure.”  There’s a big difference.  “Innovation under pressure.”  Right?  Cleveland Clinic knows all about that.
As we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker.  There’s tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration’s efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it’s going to roar once it gets open.  I think it’s going to go up tremendously.
You see what’s happening with the stock market already, because a lot of the very smart financial people — the great minds — they’re looking at the stock and they’re saying, “Wow.”  Because they really — what they’re really seeing is how we’re doing.  If we weren’t doing well, the market wouldn’t be at a level that it is today.  They have a lot of confidence that we’re doing the right thing and that our country is going to be open soon and our country is going to be booming.
We’ve had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going.  So I thank them for wanting to contribute.  And we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders, seeking their input on how we can return to what was, until very recently, the greatest economy anywhere in the world — and I can say the greatest economy in the history of the world.  There’s never been an economy like we had.
Just a little bit more than a month ago, we set every record you could set: more people working than we’ve ever had working before — almost 160 million; the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had; and the best employment numbers we’ve ever had.  Everybody was doing well.  Stock market at a record — 142 days it hit a record.  And I think we’re going to top those records, okay?  And I think we’re going to top them soon, once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen.
The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized, and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody.  I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly.  And I will then be authorizing each individual governor, of each individual state, to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate.
The day will be very close because certain states, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other states.  It’s going to be very, very close.  Maybe even before the date of May 1st.  So that will be for some states.  Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape.  And we think we’re going to be able to get them open fairly quickly, and then others will follow.
The federal government will be watching them very closely, and we’ll be there to help.  We’ll be there to help in many different ways, as we’ve been — where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody has ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody has ever seen before.  Nobody can even believe.
Other foreign countries — even powerful countries — can’t believe what we were able to do with ventilators.  Big, powerful countries.  Big producing countries can’t believe what we were able to do.  We will hold the governors accountable.  But again, we’re going to be working with them to make sure it works really well.
Now, we have a list of people that I’ll be speaking to over the next very short period of time — in many cases, tomorrow.  We’re going to have elected officials, and we’ll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours.  But we have a list of different industries that I’ll be discussing by — meeting by telephone, because we don’t want people traveling right now: the American Farm Bureau Federation — Zippy Duvall, Cisco Systems, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Corteva, Tractor Supply Company, Seaboard Corporation, Grimmway Farms, Mountaire Farms, and others in the agricultural business
In banking, it’s: Bank of America — Brian Moynihan has been great; JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon; Goldman Sachs; Citigroup; Wells Fargo; U.S. Bancorp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman; Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bancorp — all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas.
And if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible.  And I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers.  I hope they’re able to get that done very quickly because it’s been an incredible success, and many are already spending that money, and the money has been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time.  It was only a week ago.  But a lot of money has been distributed already.  It’s going to keep our small businesses open.
The construction labor workforce: International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey.  These are a lot of friends of mine.  The Laborers’ International Union of North America, Terry O’Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel; Fluor; National Association of Homebuilders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO; G.H. Palmer.  So these are some of the unions — pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line.
In defense, we have: Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman.  These are all the top of each company — CEOs, chairmans, presidents.  Raytheon, General Dynamics.
Energy — we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend.  It finished with tremendous credit going to Russia and Saudi Arabia.  And it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day are cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that’s been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50 percent of the business.  It’s been an amazing achievement.  Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made.  Maybe the biggest oil deal ever made, they’re saying.  I didn’t know that.
But we were involved in getting that done, and it was very important.  We’re going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry — Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy states.  It’s great.  So we’re very happy about it.  I want to thank everybody.  We had the — it’s called OPEC Plus.  That’s OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC.
And I also want to thank the President of Mexico because he was — he was terrific.  He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done.  I want to thank him very much.
On the energy front, we had: Exxon Mobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan; Hess Corporation, Pearl Group, and a few others.  Big ones.  Great ones.
Financial services, we have: Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson & Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliott Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; MasterCard; Visa; Chubb; Sequoia; Stephens, Warren Stevens — great; Charles Schwab, Chuck Schwab, who will be here by phone.
Food and beverage: National Restaurant Association; McDonald’s; Darden Restaurants; Coca-Cola; Pepsi Cola; Chick-fil-A; Subway; Bloomin’ Brands; Yum! Brands; Papa John’s; Wendy’s; Waffle House; Starbucks; Wolfgang Puck; Thomas Keller; Jean-Georges, my friend Jean-Georges; and Daniele.  You know them.
From the transportation world: FedEx, Fred Smith; Allegiant; United Airlines, Oscar Munoz; UPS, David Abney; J.B. Hunt; YRC Worldwide; Crowley Maritime — incredible, big, powerful shippers and transportation companies.
In telecommunications, we have: the legendary John Malone of Liberty Media; Verizon; T-Mobile; Charter Communications; and Brian Roberts of Comcast.  Thank you all very much.
Healthcare: New York Presbyterian, Jerry Speyer — a friend of mine; HCA Healthcare, Sam Hazen.  Thank you, Sam.  Just met with Sam.  Ascension Health, CommonSpirit Health, Community Health Systems, Trinity Health, Cardinal Health, McKesson, 3M.  Thank you, Mike Roman, for helping us with face masks.  It worked out well for everybody.  Procter and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific — they’ve been helping us incredibly with testing.  Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche — and Roche has been fantastic on testing, the job they’ve done.  I have to call them out.  They have really — they have stepped up like very few.  Anthem; United Health Group; Aetna; Cigna; and Humana — all the big ones.
The tech companies — we have the right ones: Apple, we have Tim Cook; Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar; Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz; Salesforce, Marc Benioff; SAP — SAP, Jen Morgan; Microsoft, Satya — great job he’s done.  Thank you, Satya.  Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg; IBM; Intel; Qualcomm; Cisco; Advanced Micro Devices; Broadcom.  Incredible companies.  Companies that no other country will catch, if they’re smart.  They have to be smart.
But I’ve dealt with a lot of different countries and I will say that no — the respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies — there’s nobody even close to our tech companies.  They can’t catch them.  So they try and buy them, but we sort of put an end to a lot of that.
In sports — we want to get our sports back, so importantly.  These will be some separate calls.  Some will be together, by the way — lists — and some will be separate.  But we have to get our sports back.  I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.  But I haven’t actually had too much time to watch.  I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work.
The NBA — Adam Silver.  The Major League Baseball — we miss our base- — well, this is baseball season right here.  Rob Manfred, thank you very much.  NFL — Roger Goodell.  Thank you, Roger.  UFC, Dana White.  Great Dana White.  PGA, Jay Monahan; LPGA, Michael Whan; USDA, Patrick Galbraith.  Major League Soccer, Don Garber; WWE, the great Vince McMahon; NASCAR, Lesa Kennedy.  Thank you, Lesa.  NHL, Gary Bettman; from the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft; Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones; Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban.
And some of the thought leaders that we’re going to have — and there’s some others that we are having; we’re just waiting to hear.  But everybody’s saying yes, I must say.  John Allison; Heritage Foundation, Kay Coles James — great person.  Hoover Institute, Condoleezza Rice — another great person.  Art Laffer; Steve Moore; Steve Forbes; Larry Lindsey; Katherine Reynolds; Scott Gottlieb — just spoke with Scott; Jim DeMint — and Jim has been a terrific friend; Bill Haggerty; and Ray Washburne.
And religious leaders will be coming on Friday.  We’ll be speaking to — and we’re going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders.  We have incredible people and they want to — they want to be a part.  And we’ll be talking about churches and we’ll be talking about opening.  And we’ll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me.  We’re going to find out how we’re doing in that regard.
So those are the names that we have on our list.  They’re the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest.  And they’re going to give us some ideas.  But we’re all set, as I said.  The governors are going to be opening up their states.  They’re going to declare when — they’re going to know when.  Some can open very, very shortly — if not almost immediately.  We’ll give a date.  But the date is going to be in the very near future.
So we’ll get it open.  Individual states will — and the governors will be held accountable.  If they need things, we’ll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing.  We want them — because they’re equipped to do testing.  We’ve created incredible tests and we’ve done more testing than anybody has ever done in the world right now.  And we — we had a broken system and now we have a great system.  We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, “We want to get some of those tests.”
I want to thank Abbott, because Abbott came up with the first simpler tests.  The first one was rough.  If you were — I think it was more of an operation than a test.  (Laughter.)  The first one was — for anybody that took it, it was not easy.  But now we have a very simple test with Abbott.  Now we have saliva, we have lots of other things that are happening.  But we have millions of tests.
The governors are responsible.  They have to take charge.  They have to do a great job.  And we’re going to suggest that they check people, through tests or otherwise, coming into their states and they run their states very strong.  Eventually, we won’t have to do that.  Eventually, this will be gone.  But, for a while, we’re going to do it.  So they’re going to take charge — at their borders, they’re going to take charge of people coming in.  And maybe, to an extent, depending on what they work out with their nearby state, it may be also people leaving.  And they’ll be able to do that very shortly.
We’ll be announcing a date, but it’ll be very short.  And, frankly, it’ll be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed — the end of April.  So we think that some of the governors will be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that.  We’ll speak to them.  But we’re all set and we’re counting on the governors to do a great job.
Others are going to have to take a longer period of time until they’re in a position to say, “We’re ready to go.”  And that’s okay.  We understand that.  Some of the governors have a very tough situation.  But in almost all cases, it’s all starting to come down.  We’re very proud of the job everybody has done.
And if you look at the numbers — so the minimum, as you — as portrayed — Deborah is here.  Dr. Birx has been fantastic.  The minimum was 100,000 deaths.  And I hope to be substantially under the minimum, meaning we all hope — Mike, right? — we all hope to be substantially under.
We did the right thing because, otherwise, it would have been — the projections are 2 million people.  The actual projection was 2.2 million people.  And if you cut it in half, that would be 1.1 million people.  That’s many more.  That’s double the Civil War.  And if you cut that in half, you’re talking 5- or 600,000 people.  That’s what we lost in the Civil War.  And that’s cutting it, cutting it, cutting it.  And we’re not going to — that would not be acceptable.  It would not be acceptable.  Nothing is — one life isn’t acceptable, but we weren’t given that option.
So I’m confident that these respected people that I just read from the list will give us some great ideas, in addition to what the governors have learned.  The governors have learned a lot.  I’ve spoken to governors that, at the beginning, it was a contentious relationship, and now it’s a very friendly relationship and a really great relationship.  And I’m proud to say that some of them, I think, are friends.  In some cases, they’re Democrats, but I think they like me, and I actually like them.  I’ll tell you who they are someday.
But we’re all getting along and we all want to do the right thing.  And I think they’re going to do a great job of leading their individual states.  It’ll be a beautiful thing to watch.  They’ll go and rely on their mayors and their local town officials.  They bring it right down.
And Washington shouldn’t be doing that.  We can’t be thinking about a Walmart parking lot that’s 2,000 miles away where we’re doing testing, but a governor of a state can, and a mayor can, and right down the line.  So it’s going to be — I think it’s going to be a terrific system.  And if we’re unhappy with the state, we’re going to let them know we’re unhappy.  And if they’re not doing the job and they can’t get the job done, and, for some reason, things are happening that we’re not going to like — like the numbers are heading in a wrong direction — we’ll have to do something that’s very ser- — very serious.  We’ll have to, maybe, close them up and start all over again.  But I don’t think we’re going to have to do that.
I think the governors are going to come out at a time that — and these will be individual dates.  And the governors are going to come out at a time when they’re ready.  Some can come out very, very shortly.  And we look forward to watching that process.  So I think it’s going to be a very beautiful process.
Our discussions will focus with the people that we’re dealing with on rejuvenating the economy, and always health.  Always health.  Health and life.  Living is number one.  But the rejuvenated economy — and I think it’s going to go quickly.
We’ll be utilizing our robust testing capacity for the governors.  We’ll be giving them what they need, if they don’t have it themselves.  We hope, by now, they’ll be able to have it themselves.  We were hoping they would have had it themselves early on, but they weren’t.  But such great advances have been made.  So we’ll be dealing with them on that.
And we — they can rely on us very strongly.  They’re going to be relying on us, I think, for some help.  And we’re there — whether it’s building hospital beds, which I don’t think they’re going to need.  You look at Javits Center — a great, great job that the Army Corps of Engineers did; FEMA got involved.  We actually ended up sending our medical people.  That was not a COVID-19 center, and they asked, “Could you do that?”
And then even after we did that, it was not used very much, meaning they didn’t have to use it nearly to the extent that they thought when they conceived it.  It wasn’t that they made a mistake; nobody made a mistake.  We built it — I’d rather have too much than too little.  Err on the side of caution.  And it’s really incredible what they did, including the two ships — the two great ships.
And I just want to thank a lot of really great people, a lot of great politicians.  And, again, we’re going to be announcing the political list tomorrow.  And on there, we’re going to have a lot of senators.
And we’re going to be having a meeting with the governors probably on Thursday — a meeting by teleconference.  And a lot of things will be discussed and some of the details will be discussed.  But we want them to do an incredible job of running their states.  I think they’ll do an incredible job too.  After having gotten to know so many of them, I think each one of them will do an incredible job.
And, again, the federal government is there.  We have ventilators if they need them.  We have beds if they need them.  We have hospitals if they need them.  We have a testing capacity that’s now second to none.  We’re — again, other countries are calling us.  Countries that you thought were doing well are calling us for help on testing.  So we’re there to help.
And, with that, if you have a few questions, we’ll take them.  And if not, that would be okay too.
Yeah, go ahead please.  Jeff?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing/

5:49 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet.  We’re speaking with the governors and representatives.  FEMA is already on its way, and they got there — as soon as we heard the word, I said, “Get out there.”  So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does.  It’s, really, something very special.
So we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we’re with you all the way.  It’s a tough deal.  That was a bad, bed level five.  That was a bad group.  That’s as high as it gets.  It was a bad grouping of tornadoes.  Something that’s something incredible, the power — the horrible, destructive power.
America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus.  Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide.  Flat.  Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana.  This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines.  It’s been incredible what they’ve done.
You looked at the charts, and the charts are — and the models from early on — predictions were 100 [thousand] and 120,000 people look like.  If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish.  And we’re going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number.  So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it’s still just a horrible thing all over the world.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.
This is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning.  We appreciate it so much.  In fact, Dr. Fauci is here.  Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further.
Thank you very much.  Tony, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Just one — a couple of things, and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday.
You’re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we’ve been talking about and how things are starting to balance off.  And I think the more, as we go by each day, I think we’re going to see — and again, I never like to get ahead of myself or of Dr. Birx, but it looks like even though we’ve had a really bad week last week — remember, when I was speaking to you before, I was saying this was really a bad week — there’s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we’re starting to see in some areas now that kind of flattening, particularly in a place that was a hotspot like New York.  That’s the first thing.
The second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning, for about an hour, and they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range, about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, but specifically African American.
And, I mean, I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are, to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification, where proper and where appropriate, to isolate and contact trace if we can, but also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately.
So I just wanted to get that out of the way.
The other point I wanted to make is that I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question.  And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it’s what “would have” or “could have.”  The nature of the hypothetical question was: If, in fact, we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved?  And the answer to my question was, as I always do — and I’m doing right now — perfectly honestly say, “yes.”  I mean, obviously.  If you — mitigation helps.
I’ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works.  So if mitigation works, and you instigated and — you initiated earlier, you will probably have saved more lives.  If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives, if you initiated at a certain time.
That was taken as a way that maybe, somehow, something was at fault here.
So let me tell you from my experience — and I can only speak from my own experience — is that we had been talking, before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness or not, of strong mitigations.  So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean.
The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to actually have a, quote, “shutdown” in the sense of — not really “shutdown” but to really have strong mitigation, we discussed it.  Obviously, there would be concern by some that, in fact, that might have some negative consequences.  Nonetheless, the President listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.
The next second time that I went with Dr. Birx in — to the President and said, “Fifteen days are not enough.  We need to go thirty days,” obviously, there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects.  Nonetheless, at that time, the President went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days.
So I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were.  But, clearly, as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn’t have the chance to clarify.
Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-25/

1:52 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody, and good afternoon.  Today is Good Friday.  And this Sunday, millions of Christians celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  At this holy time, we pray that God will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes.  As American families look forward to Easter, we’re reminded that our story ends not in despair, but in triumph and renewal.  Very appropriate, isn’t it?
I’d like to provide Americans an update on our ongoing efforts in the war against the invisible enemy.  Before I do that, I’ll have a couple of notes.  The United States, in discussions last night with Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and –dealing with OPEC nations — we are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, “over the barrel.”  And Mexico is committing to do 100,000 fewer barrels.
The President and I spoke last night.  We have a great relationship, great friendship.  They’re helping us very much at the border.  They have 27,000 soldiers — Mexican soldiers — on our border right now, stopping people from coming into our country as our wall goes up.  We’re up to about 168 miles of wall.
And in speaking with the President, they have a limit.  The OPEC nations have agreed to a different limit: a reduction of about 23 percent.  So what I thought I would do — and I don’t know that it’s going to be accepted; we’ll find out — the United States will help Mexico along and they’ll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they’re prepared to do so.
And we had a great conversation, but we’ll find out how that all works out.  As you know, they’re trying to get rid of the glut of oil.  There’s a tremendous glut of oil.  And we don’t want anything to hurt our incredible industry.  We’re actually the largest producer in the world now, so we don’t want anything to hurt those jobs — those great jobs in Texas and North Dakota, in Oklahoma, and everywhere.  We have a tremendous energy — New Mexico — tremendous energy business.  And we want to keep those jobs.
So we’re — we’re working on it.  I think, eventually, it’s going to work out.  It may work out quicker than what most people thought possible.  And maybe it won’t, but it’ll work out eventually.
Our experts are monitoring the data from every part of our country having to do with the topic that we’re here to discuss.  In the midst of grief and pain, we’re seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives.  Tremendous progress is being made.  Although when you look at some of the numbers — I just spoke with Governor Cuomo; we had a good talk.  When you look at those numbers — the numbers of death, people that have died — it’s so horrible.
Now, on the other side, you have the numbers of beds being used, we were just saying, are substantially reduced.  That’s usually the sign that it’s heading in the downward curve.  So, New York, we know where that is.  But in the midst of all this grief and this pain, we’re seeing these signs and we’re seeing them very strongly.  And a lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives.  We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been.
So, nobody knows what the number is, but we had a number of 100,000 lives.  As many as that is, it’s impossible to even think of it.  And that was the low end with a tremendous amount of work and a tremendous amount of — you can call it many different things.  Our people had to be extremely strong and brave to be able to put up with what they’ve put up with.  But the minimum, if you did this social distancing at every other aspect — and I think I can say 90 percent, maybe even more than that, were able to do it — the minimum number was 100,000 lives, and I think we’ll be substantially under that number.
Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 — you could never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking.  So they said between 100- and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything.  But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people of this country.
So we’ll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we’re headed to a number substantially below the 100,000.  That would be the low mark.  And I hope that bears out.
The situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing.  Detroit has really started to go up, and now it is stabilizing.  And New Orleans is a great place; I have so many friends there.  They can’t believe what’s happening, but it’s really stabilized.  I spoke with the governor of Louisiana.  And, as you know, we’re building them additional beds right now — the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA — and that is going to be done.  And I hope they’re not going to be very well used because I think they’ve really — I don’t think they’re going to need them or certainly not very many of them.  We built them a big hospital of 1,000 beds and now we’re — we’re in the midst of doing another 1,000.  I don’t think they’re going to be using very many of them, and that’s a good thing.
There was a time, two weeks ago, where we said, “That’s not going to be nearly enough.  We’re going to have to build more.”  But we wanted to wait to see and I’m glad we waited.  It just looks like they’re doing really well.  Louisiana and the state of Michigan is doing, really, much better than we thought.
In Washington State, we’ve made enough progress that the governor is now able to return an Army field hospital, so we’re going to take that hospital.  We don’t think we need any more hospitals.  We built thousands of beds all over the country, and we think we’re probably not going to need that hospital anyway.  And if we do, we’re ready to move it to a different location.
In New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially, as I said.  And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working.
Over time, our guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions.  And we’re seeing that; it’s incredible.  I think, with no exceptions, it’s looking like it’s lower.  And again, that’s because of the people doing what they had to do.  Great people.  And working with elected representatives and — and the doctors, the nurses, and everybody — I mean, just everybody.  Everybody is so, so — has been so amazing.
I was told this morning again, “Please mention all of those people working in the grocery stores.”  And it’s true.  The checkouts and the clerks and the people that are really — and a number of those people have become infected.  So we want to thank them and a shout-out to them.
With the tireless devotion of American doctors and nurses and all of the medical people, we’ve kept our fatality rate very, very low compared to other countries.  My administration is closely monitoring the data on the virus’s impact on our cherished African American communities because they’ve been hit hard.  And the Surgeon General will be sharing more of that information right after we’re finished here.  He’ll be coming up and saying exactly what’s happening because it’s really — it’s very troublesome, I will tell you that.
I’d also like to provide clarity on the important point for many Americans on elective surgeries.  While we’ve asked hospitals to cancel surgeries and procedures that do not take place at this time, just not to do them now — the choice to delay any treatment still remains between the patient and their doctor.  We’re not advising Americans to postpone medical treatment that the doctor believes should occur now.  So it’s different kinds of surgery, obviously, but we’re really getting to the point where you can start to think about doing that surgery, if necessary, pretty soon, I think.  Pretty soon.
Yesterday, I directed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny to — Sonny Perdue to expedite aid to American farmers.  And Secretary Perdue will be using all of the tools at his disposal to develop a program — and very quickly — of at least $16 billion to provide relief for farmers, ranchers, and producers impacted by the coronavirus.
In this time of crisis, we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning — right from beginning to end.  And we’re committed to supporting the amazing men and women who produce supply.  I did, last night, a statement on social media, and I said I have directed Secretary Sonny Perdue to expedite help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are very, very badly hurting right now.  I expect Secretary Perdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable and safe, and our great farmers are prosperous and continue to be prosperous.
We’re working very hard to make sure our food supply chain is sound and plentiful, but we all know that that begins with our farmers, cattlemen, ranchers, and producers.  So we’re going to be working with the small farmers, the big farmers, the cattlemen, the ranchers — all of the producers.   We’re going to take care of them.  We’re working with them right now.  We have a lot of money that was put there through our use of tariffs and other means, and we’re going to help out our farmers.
And I don’t think — I tell you, I’ve been helping our farmers for a couple of years because they were targeted, as you know, by China and others.  And I think they’re very grateful to what — for what we’ve done.
On the medical front, the FDA — FDA has issued 47 emergency use authorizations for advancements and testing new ventilator designs, innovations, and personal protective equipment, and experimental medicines.  And Dr. Hahn is going to be talking about that.  We’ve cut through the red tape to give doctors and patients unprecedented freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, granting access to potential therapies and drugs.
Since Monday, we’ve deployed two major shipments of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile.  And it’s going to various cities.
And we are also disposing and getting, as quickly as we can, portions of it to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.  And speaking of the Department of Defense, they’re going to be sending us 10 million N95 masks that they had.  And we’re in great shape in every way.  We’re in great shape with ventilators.  We’re in great shape with protective clothing.  We have additional planeloads coming in.
But we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment.  I can speak, I think for — Vice President Pence will be talking in a little while.  We’re getting — we’re getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything.  They’re in great shape for this surge that’s coming in certain areas in particular, and that’s a good job.  You’ve done a great job on that, Mike.  Really, a great job.  I appreciate it.  The whole country appreciates it.
More than 2 million coronavirus tests have now been completed, and we’re conducting approximately 100,000 more every day.  We’re also working to bring blood-based serology tests to the market as quickly as possible so that Americans can determine whether or not they have already had the virus and potentially have immunity.
They have immunity if they’ve had the virus.  A lot of them don’t even know if they’ve had it.  Sometimes it’s brutal.  You see the Prime Minister seems to be doing well now, I hope.  He had a rough go of it, and still is, but he’s doing better.  And then some people don’t even know they had it.  It could be sniffles.  It could be they don’t feel perfect, but they’ve had it.  And they’re the lucky ones.
The NIH, CDC, and FDA are currently validating these antibody tests to ensure that they are accurate, and they’re doing that at breakneck speed.  I think we can say that, Doctor.  And we’re going to get them approved very quickly — Dr. Hahn.
When validated, we’re confident that the production will scale up to tens of millions of tests very quickly.  We’re leading the world now in testing, by far, and we’re going to keep it that way.  Other countries are coming to us, and they’re wanting to know about our tests and can they buy the tests, and can they do whatever they have to do to get the tests.  And we’re going to make that — very soon, we’ll be in a position to make that possible because it’s important for them to have it.
And we’re going to have an announcement on the World Health Organization sometime next week.  As you know, we give them approximately $500 million a year, and we’re going to be talking about that subject next week.  We’ll have a lot to say about it.  We’ll hold it.
Every American should be proud of what our country has achieved in just a short period of time.  The U.S. military has deployed thousands of personnel to build 23 temporary hospitals with more than 16,000 beds.  And we have the potential to build many more if we needed them, but we’re all ready to go.  But I don’t think we’re going to need them, which is great — great news.
And we built those hospitals in 12 states and the District of Columbia using the Defense Production Act.  And we used it like a hammer.  A lot of the media said: Oh, we weren’t using it.  We used it like a hammer to a point where all we had to do was say the words and everybody gave us max.  And they’ve done a good job.  They really have done a good job, with few exceptions.
And we’ve harnessed the full power of American industry to produce ventilators and other essential supplies.  Right now, we’re making thousands of ventilators, many of which we won’t need, but we’ll use them in our stockpile.  And we’ll build that up.  We’ll also help build up the stockpiles, which they should have had in the states.  And so we’re working with governors on that, and we’ll also help other countries or countries that are calling us for help, if they need ventilators and they’re in no no position to build ventilators.  We are.  We have Ford and General Motors, and many, many companies are building ventilators.
So we’re going to be helping — at a not-too-distant point, we’re going to be helping quite a few of the countries.
Now, we’ve launched Project Airbridge to deliver nearly 300 million pieces of personal protective equipment from and around the globe.  We’re also shipping out 60 sterilization systems to 10 different cities that can each sterilize up to 80,000 masks each day, and I’m even hearing it can go up to 120,000 masks a day — certain equipment with certain additions.  It’s a company in Ohio that makes it.  It’s a great company.  Great — I hear it’s a great product.  It works very well.
I asked that question; I said, “How come we have to buy so many masks?  Why can’t we sterilize the masks that are being used?”  And the answer was, “You can.”  In this case, they say, up to 20 times.  So we can take a mask — certain types of masks — the N95s in particular — and we can sterilize them, make them very clean, up to 20 times.  That’s a great thing.
In addition, we passed the largest emergency economic relief package in American history to save the U.S. economy and protect the American worker.  As you know, this past week, which was four active days on the stock market — Good Friday today is not — is not included; the markets are closed.  In four days, we had the biggest market increase — stock market increase that we’ve had in 50 years.  That tells you that there’s a pent-up demand.  That tells you they want to get back.  There’s something good going to happen.  I really believe that.  There’s something very good going to happen.  We have to get back.
So think of it: In this horrible period, this horrible, dark period where this — this monster came and worked its horrible, horrible spell over the world — 184 countries as of this morning.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.
We’ve done well, and I guess the market thinks we’ve done well, because we hit the biggest stock market increase without one day — we’re talking four days instead of five — that we’ve had in 50 years.  Fifty years.  Think of that.  More than 50 years, actually.
In short, the American people have launched the greatest mobilization of our society since World War Two, deploying every scientific, governmental, medical, and military resource to defeat the virus.
So I want to just start then with — we’re going to answer questions later.  We’ll have time.  I think we have a lot of time today.  A lot of people are off, as they should be.  Good Friday.
But — so I’ll stick around, and we’ll answer questions later.  I want to start with Deborah Birx, please.  Dr. Birx.  And you can go over some of the numbers we just looked at, and that’d be great.
Thank you very much, Deborah.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for outlining how well we are doing in a series of metro areas.  What also has been encouraging, for those of you who are watching epidemic curves every day — and I’m sure you are, and lot — watching them in log phase, because that’s how epidemiologists like to look at their curves — you can see for the first time that, in the United States, we’re starting to level on the logarithmic phase, like Italy did about a week ago.  And so this gives us great heart on that — not only in specific places, but we’re starting to see that change.
Obviously, a lot of that is driven by the improvement in New York City.  Remember, for a long time, they were over 50 percent of our cases and 50 percent of our new cases.  That has dramatically changed because of the impact of what the citizens of New York and New Jersey and across Connecticut, and now Rhode Island, are doing to really change the course of this pandemic and really change the trajectory of new cases.
We’re seeing that what many states and metro areas were — experienced as twofold and fourfold — fourfold increases that went to twofold — that now those are going to eight days between the doubling rate.  Watching this every day gives us hope across these metro areas, from New York and New Jersey and all through Denver, and of course, through New Orleans.
We still see cases occurring in the Boston area and in Chicago, but their rate of increase seems to be stabilizing.  And we really want to call out the work of the mayors of Baltimore and the District and Philadelphia who have really brought all of their health — health experts together and, working with their communities, are starting to really change the curves in those areas.
What we’re seeing is we’re united in social distancing, and that’s been very encouraging to all of us, and it should be encouraging to the healthcare providers that are on the frontline, many of which are serving our Americans with such dignity and respect and ensuring that everybody gets optimal care.
And as the President noted, our mortality in the United States is significantly less than many of the other countries when you correct them for our population.  And that is really solely the work of our health — our frontline healthcare providers.
And so working with — you can really — hopefully you get the theme today that we are incredibly proud of our public health leaders at the city level, at the state level, at the federal level who are working together to really change the course of this pandemic, working with their citizens in their communities to make these changes, and the American public who has really taken all of this to heart and stayed home.
I know, last week, we really asked a lot of people in the Washington and Baltimore area to consolidate, not go out frequently to grocery stores or pharmacies.  You can really see that that’s having a huge impact.
So it’s really about the encouraging signs that we see.  But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.  And so, every day, we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that’s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.
We continue to really applaud the work of California and Washington State and Oregon.  We’re learning from all three of those states, from their public health officials, about how they were able to keep the virus from ever becoming logarithmic.  And I think that’s an important lesson for all of us on how they did that, what the timing was, in case we ever have to face this issue in the future.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Tony?
THE PRESIDENT:  Doctor, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  So again, just keeping on the theme that Dr. Birx had mentioned, this is the end of the week — that famous week that we spoke about last weekend — in which we — what actually was predicted to happen, happened.  We’re starting to see the leveling off and the coming down that Dr. Birx had mentioned.
But it’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all.  I was actually hearkened [sic] by the fact that we’ve been talking about the New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, and other areas where they have really big spikes, but there’s other parts of the country, in the middle parts of the country, where they’re concerned to make sure they don’t get those spikes.
And I really want to salute the governors of states throughout the entire United States, but particularly in the central part of the country because the governors after they see us in these press conferences.  And I’ve had calls over the last several days from several of the governors — you know, from Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah.  Just about an hour and a half ago, I spoke with the governors of Arkansas and Wyoming, who are really committed to make sure that they don’t get into the situation where they’re going to have spikes in their state.  And they’re doing the kinds of things that they don’t get recognized, because people don’t talk about them much.
But we have a big country.  We have 50 states.  And it’s not only the big cities.  So if we’re going to pull out of this, we’re going to pull out of it in the big cities and we’re going to pull out in those areas that aren’t as densely populated.
And I just want to give a shout out to them.  They’re doing an extraordinary job.  I was really pleasant- — I wouldn’t say “surprised,” because I expect it of this country — but to hear what they’re doing and the commitment that they’re putting into making sure that we don’t have the kinds of situations that we’ve experienced, unfortunately, in other areas — this is very important.
I just want to close by — one other thing, something I mentioned yesterday and the day before — that there are a lot of candidate interventions that are going into clinical trials.  For those of you who are interested in it, I recommend you go to ClinicalTrials.gov, and you’ll see the design of a clinical trial, and you’ll see that many of them are the randomized control trials that are the really gold standard of how you find out whether something really is safe and effective.  And as the weeks and months — and it’ll probably be months — sometime in the summer, we’ll start to see which are working, which are not.  And to focus on those that are — we’re developing and we’re working.
I’ll be happy to answer questions later.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Please, Doctor.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
DR. HAHN:  The White House Task Force has been very focused on increasing the supply of personal protective equipment for our great providers.  I was one of those providers a few months ago and I can tell you nothing is more important than making sure they have what they need.
So, in order to increase the supply of N95 masks, FDA has worked with industry and has now authorized two companies who will supply machines to sterilize N95 masks.
Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA are purchasing, on behalf of U.S. government, 60 sterilization machines, as mentioned by the President.  And they will be positioned around the country to increase the amount of supply of N95 masks.
Each machine will be able to sterilize 80,000 95 masks [sic] — N95 masks per day.  And we hope to actually increase that further.
The Vice President and the White House Task Force challenged us yesterday, and we responded as a team.  FDA issued revised guidance regarding the laundering of gowns because gowns are another issue, in terms of supply, that we’re looking forward on.
This is not something that normally happens around the country, but issued this guidance.  It’s on our website now at FDA.  So there’s information about how hospitals can do that to increase the supply.
We’ve heard concerns that maybe hospitals might not want to do that because of regulations.  And I can — happy to tell you that Administrator Verma and I have worked on this — certified providers and suppliers who follow FDI [sic] — FDA guidance, as posted on the website, will be compliant with Medicare and Medicaid requirements.
And then finally, last week FDA provided guidance to manufacturers on manufacturing specifications for cloth gowns.  This is another attempt to increase the number of gowns.  Typically, it’s plastic or other types of materials.  And this guidance, if followed, can be used by manufacturers to actually make these gowns and no further regulatory red tape will be necessary.  They can go into circulation.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Please.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Thank you, Mr.  President.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I started off the week talking about the challenges that lie ahead, and I want to finish the week just by reiterating what you’ve heard.  Mitigation works.  It definitively and quantitatively is working.  And I want to say thank you to America for your efforts to help flatten the curve and to save lives.
But, at the President’s direction, yesterday, I met with 2,000 Hispanic leaders from their communities.  And today, the Vice President led a phone call that I was on with hundreds of African American leaders, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, including Derrick Johnson of the NAACP, including the National Medical Association and the Black Nurses Association, to talk about some of the alarming trends we’re observing regarding the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color.
And you’ve heard the stats in New York City: Hispanics represent the majority of deaths.  In Milwaukee County, blacks are 25 percent of the population but almost 50 percent of the cases and 75 percent of the deaths.  So what’s going on?  Well, it’s alarming but it’s not surprising that people of color have a greater burden of chronic health conditions.
African Americans and Native Americans develop high blood pressure at much younger ages, and it’s less likely to be under control, and does greater harm to their organs.  Puerto Ricans have higher rates of asthma and black boys are three times as likely to die of asthma as their white counterparts.  As a matter of fact, I’ve been carrying around an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack.  And I hope that showing you this inhaler shows little kids with asthma all across the country that they can grow up to be Surgeon General one day.
But I — more immediately share it so that everyone knows it doesn’t matter if you look fit, if you look young.  You are still at risk for getting and spreading and dying from coronavirus.
The chronic burden of medical ills is likely to make people of color especially less resilient to the ravages of COVID-19.  And it’s possibly — in fact, likely — that the burden of social ills is also contributing.
Social distancing and teleworking, we know, are critical, and you’ve heard Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci talk about how they prevent the spread of coronavirus.  Yet only one in five African Americans and one in six Hispanics has a job that lets them work from home.
People of color are more likely to live in densely packed areas and in multi-generational housing, which — situations which create higher risk for spread of a highly contagious disease like COVID-19.
We tell people to wash their hands, but as studies showed, 30 percent of the homes on Navajo Nation don’t have running water.  So how are they going to do that?
In summary, people of color experience both more likely exposure to COVID-19 and increased complications from it.  But let me be crystal clear: We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically predisposed to get COVID-19.  There is nothing inherently wrong with you.  But they are socially predisposed to coronavirus dispos- — exposure and to have a higher incidence of the very diseases that puts you at risk for severe complications of coronavirus.
But as the Vice President shared on the call this morning, this history — and I want you to hear me say this — it does not have to be our nation’s future.  We’re taking steps now, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach, protect, and strengthen all communities impacted by this disease, and especially our communities of color.
More details will be forthcoming.  But we are actively working, as the Vice President and the CDC director laid out today, on data collection; targeted outreach to communities of color; and increasing financial employment, education, housing, social and health supports, so that everybody has an equal chance to be healthy.
And I want to close by saying that while your state and local health departments and those of us in public service are working day and night to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect you regardless of your color, your creed, or your geography, I need you to know: You are not helpless.  And it’s even more important that, in communities of color, we adhere to the task force guidelines to slow the spread.
Stay at home, if possible.  If you must go out, maintain six feet of distance between you and everyone else, and wear a mask if you’re going to be within six feet of others.  Wash your hands more often than you ever dreamed possible.  Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.  And call your friends and family.  Check in on your mother; she wants to hear from you right now.
And speaking of mothers, we need you to do this, if not for yourself, then for your abuela.  Do it for your granddaddy.  Do it for your Big Mama.  Do it for your Pop-Pop.  We need you to understand — especially in communities of color, we need you to step up and help stop the spread so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable.
This epidemic is a tragedy, but it will be all the more tragic if we fail to recognize and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and an array of other diseases and risk factors on communities of color.  The task force and this administration are determined not to let that happen.  The President, the Vice President have said we will not let that happen.
We can’t fix these issues overnight, but I promise you we will work with your communities to quickly and meaningfully move the needle in the right direction.  Nothing less than the fate of our families and friends, my family and friends depends on it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.
Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met and — and heard from the President the gratitude then he and I and I know all the American people feel for all the dedicated workers at FEMA, HHS, U.S. Public Health Service, FDA, and all those that are literally working on your behalf around the clock to partner with states, to partner with local health officials.  And Mr. President, allow me to add my — my thanks and admiration to all of the entire team here at the federal level.
On this Good Friday, we — we remember those who’ve lost their lives to the coronavirus.  We remember their families, our dedicated healthcare workers, and our first responders.  And we do well, on this special day for Christians across this country, to remember them in our prayers.
But, as you just heard from Dr. Birx and from the experts, it’s also a good day to remember that Good Friday is always followed by Easter Sunday.  And there is hope.  There is hope in this moment that, thanks to what the American people are doing every day — adhering to the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America; thanks to the fact that Americans are listening to state and local leaders, and putting the health of their family members and neighbors first, we’re getting there, America.  We’re making progress.  But it’s imperative that we all continue to implement all of the guidance in the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”
As the Surgeon General just attested, at the President’s direction, we engaged more than 400 leaders in the African American community today.  And allow me to express my appreciation for their leadership and their efforts in communicating to African Americans and other minority populations some of the unique challenges that those communities face in the midst of this epidemic.
And the CDC, as the Surgeon General said, is working on not only studying the issue, but very rapidly issuing new guidance.  And we’ll be communicating that new guidance to all of those great leaders.
On the subject of testing and supplies, the President gave a great amount of detail.  More than 2.1 million tests have been performed and we continue to work very, very closely with FDA and suppliers around the country to expand the ability of testing.  And you just heard Dr. Hahn reflect on the fact that very soon we will have an antibody test that Americans will be able to take to determine whether they ever had the coronavirus.
I spoke today to the governor of Colorado, Jared Polis.  And we’ve been in contact with Senator Cory Gardner about an outbreak at a particular meatpacking facility in the Colorado area.  And at this time, our team is working with the governor and working with the senator to ensure that we flow testing resources.  At this point, there are some 14 people hospitalized, maybe 2- to 300 of the workforce have been impacted.  And we spoke about providing those resources this weekend.  I want to encourage people in Colorado that we will — we will work to support that effort, but I also want to emphasize that all the people that are working in food supply — from farmers, to meatpackers, to distributors, to truckers, to grocers — continue to have our gratitude, as President Trump said just a few moments ago.
On supplies: More than 5 billion have been obligated to the states, 29,600 National Guard have been activated, and, at the President’s direction, more than 4,700 active duty military personnel have been deployed — medical military personnel — in nine states, focusing on the areas of the most significant epidemic.
Air bridge, its 26 flights have been completed.  Four flights are scheduled to arrive today, bringing a quarter million gowns, 25 million pairs of gloves.  Fifty-four more flights are scheduled, literally bringing in supplies from around the world.
Finally, let me say, as we go into this very special weekend — into Easter services.  I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how grateful we are to all of the churches that have been there — and their ministries have been working under great difficulty — to continue to provide for the needs of your members.  There have been — there have been food drives, there have been phone calls, and ministry has continued.  And we are grateful for the role, on this Holy Week, that our churches, our synagogues, and all of our houses of worship have played.
On their behalf, allow me to remind you that even if you’re not in the pew this Easter Sunday, if you are able, it’s still a good idea to give, because those ministries continue to go forward.  And we encourage you — we encourage you to continue to support them.
We also want to say very respectfully to all of the — all the church communities around this country and all the places of worship to continue to heed the guidelines issued in the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America.  We know it’s difficult in this time of year, particularly, Mr. President, to avoid gatherings of more than 10.  But we’re grateful that so many churches, synagogues, and places of worship have done just that, and we urge you to continue to do it.
And to my Christian brothers and sisters across the country, let me encourage you with the words we should all remember that Jesus said, “Wherever two or more are gathered, there He is also.”  And so you can worship, you can celebrate Easter, and know that you’ll be blessed in so doing.  And you’ll be serving the nation.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job.  Thank you.
Okay, it’s Good Friday.  Let’s be nice.  Okay?  Let’s be real nice.  Yeah, please.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-24/

6:24 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  I’d like to begin by saying that we just completed a meeting with the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao on proposals regarding the airlines and the airline business.
And we’re working very closely with a lot of different people.  We’ll be probably putting out a proposal and giving them some of the details — some of the very powerful details over the weekend.  It’s moving along quickly.  The airline business has been hit very hard, as everybody knows.  And we are going to be in a position to do a lot to help them so that they keep their employees and they save their businesses.
And that’ll be taking place, I think you can say, over the weekend.  We may even have discussions with some of the airlines or all of the airlines over the weekend.  And I think it’s going to be a very acceptable package.  It’s a very big package and a very acceptable package.  It’ll be good for our country, good for the airlines, good for a lot of people.
Likewise, I just spoke with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, and we had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than it’s doing right now.  It’s — the numbers are so low that there’ll be layoffs all over the world.  There’ll be certainly layoffs in this country.  And we don’t want that to happen.
We built a great, great energy business in the United States.  So we have tens of thousands of jobs.  We had a very good talk; we’ll see what happens.  But as you know, OPEC met today, and I would say they’re getting close to a deal.  We’ll soon find out.  So that was a conversation we just had, so we had a busy hour and a half.
And let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the American people.  Millions of Americans are making profound and difficult sacrifices in their own lives because they know it will save the lives of countless others.  And that’s exactly what it’s doing.  You see what’s happening and where we are and where we stand.  And hopefully we’re going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope.
Together, our people are writing one of the most noble chapters in the proud history of our nation.  Americans are also encouraged to learn that Boris Johnson, Prime Minister, has been moved out of intensive care.  That’s a tremendous statement.  And we continue to pray for him and his fast recovery.  That’s a very — a very positive development.
As the New York metropolitan area continues its battle against the outbreak, the full power of the federal government is there to support them.  As you know, the Javits Center has now been fully converted into a 3,000-bed hospital — one of the
largest anywhere in the country — and by the incredible professionals.
I have to say, the Corps of Engineers, what they can do is just incredible.  They’ve done a fantastic job and they’re building, nationwide, 21 temporary hospitals and care facilities, adding 17,000 hospital beds.  And they did that all within a very short period of time.  It’s incredible what they’ve done.  Army Corps of Engineers.  And FEMA has been fantastic.
Our sweeping airlift operation to keep doctors and nurses supplied with protective equipment, Project Airbridge, continues to expand with more than 24 flights already completed and 49 additional flights now scheduled in the near future.  So that’s been very successful.  And that gear and those outfits are being handed out.  As they arrive, they’re going directly to point.
The American medical system continues to perform beyond our highest expectations, reminding us that the United States is blessed with the most advanced healthcare and the most skilled healthcare workers anywhere in the planet.  Other countries are looking to what we’re doing.  And our testing operation has now become far and away the most sophisticated and the best anywhere.
And we want to thank all of the heroes on the frontlines as they fight to save American lives.  We’re at the top of the hill.  Pretty sure we’re at the top of the hill, and now we’re going downward.  In some cases, we’ve already started that process.
Earlier today, I spoke with hundreds of mental health leaders and advocates from around the country to discuss the vital work and the vital work they’re doing.  We had the top doctors in the country, some international doctors.  Mental health — big factor.  Not only has the virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people, but also mental and emotional suffering as well.  Even though we’re staying physically apart, no American is alone, and we’re all in this together.  But the mental health doctors and experts — it was a very great call.  It was a very interesting call.  They’re working very hard.
We’re also seeing encouraging signs in our race to develop breakthrough treatments and therapies.  Pfizer revealed today that it has found a promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating.  And that hopes — it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials very soon.  It’s going to be very, very soon.  They have great — great feelings for this particular therapy, and they think that a lot of good things are happening.
Through the FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, 19 therapies and treatments are now being tested and 26 more are in the active planning or [for] clinical trial.  So we have 19 therapies being tested currently, and 26 more are in the active planning for clinical trials.  That’s a big statement.  That’s a lot.
Trials for Gilead’s antiviral drug, remdesivir, continue.  And the company has also expanded emergency use for new patients getting good, early results, by the way.  The companies that manufacture hydroxychloroquine are massively ramping up production.
As you know, many people are recommending, strongly, Z-Pak be added — the Z-Pak — and also zinc.  And the federal government continues to build our stockpiles and distribute millions of doses for doctors to use as they see fit.
And I’m pleased to inform you — we’re just having — a lot of good things are happening, but we’ll have to see how that all works out.  But we have — we’ve purchased and we have stockpiled millions and millions of doses, and we’re distributing it.  Some states want it very badly.  Michigan — we just sent a lot to Michigan and other areas.
I’m reporting today that we passed 2 million tests completed in the United States, first time — most anywhere in the country.  It’s a milestone for our country.  It’s a milestone anywhere.  Nobody has done anywhere close.  Our tests are highly sophisticated and highly accurate.
At the same time, we’re making important progress on the economic front of this war.  In a few moments, Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, will explain new steps that we’re taking to ensure American workers swiftly receive unemployment and paid leave benefits and that employers protect the health and safety of all workers, including essential workers on the job, working very, very closely with workers and with employers.
To provide further economic relief, the Federal Reserve announced this morning that it’ll provide up to $2.3 trillion in support to businesses, states, and local governments.  Six hundred billion dollars in loans will be available for mid-sized businesses with up to 10,000 employees.  And $500 billion will be available for states, counties with over 2 million residents and cities with a population of over 1 million.
My administration is also working with Congress to replenish the very successful — incredibly successful the way it’s going — Paycheck Protection Program, which is allowing hundreds of thousands of small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll, meaning it’ll keep those businesses open.
We need both Democrats and Republicans to come together to get this leg- — the legislation completed.  And it looks like it’s on its way, but we need both.  And it should be for people that are working for the workers.  And if you look and you see, we have a lot of people that are affected by that, and it’s a very positive development.  So we have to get a bipartisan approval of that.  And hopefully that’ll happen.
Today, the Department of Education is also announcing the availability of more than $6 billion in emergency grant funding to assist college students impacted by the cancellation of classes and the suspension of housing.  A lot of people had a lot of things suspended; housing is one of them.
Previously, we waived student loan payments for six months.  So, student loan payments have been waived for six months, and we’ll discuss it after that.  It may go further.
Although this medical war has separated our citizens for a period of time, it’s also united our entire nation, I think I can say, like almost never before.  Americans are moving forward with common purpose and shared resolve, determined to vanquish the virus and lift our nation to even greater heights.  We are supremely confident in the magnificent future that awaits the American people.
And with that, before I invite our Vice President — our great Vice President — and Gene Scalia to speak, we’ll take a few questions.  And then I’m going back into negotiations on oil and on airlines.
Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-23/

5:47 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is a holy week, when religious believers across the nation will observe Passover, Good Friday, and Easter.  Millions of Jewish families begin Passover at sundown tonight, a sacred, unbroken tradition that traces back to the ancient land of Egypt.  And on Sunday, we celebrate our beautiful, wonderful Easter, which we all look forward to.  And we’re going to have many Easters together in churches in the future.
We’re getting closer.  You see the numbers.  We’re getting much closer to getting our country back to the way it was.  We have now an extra two countries that have been attacked: 184. They’re being attacked as we speak, but we’ll all win.  At some point, we’re going to all win.  We’re going to do it sooner than people think.
Earlier today, I spoke with 10,000 of America’s faith leaders to thank them for raising the spirits of our people during these very difficult days.  While we may be physically apart, we can use this time to pray, to reflect, and to focus on our personal relationship with God.
I also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration’s ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus.  And that’s happening.  And it’s happening, I think if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought.  Maybe a lot more quickly, I hope.  And it’s something that all over the world we’re watching, but people are watching us and seeing what we’re doing, and they’re very impressed.
We’re dealing with many countries right now.  Many, many countries.  And we’re giving them whatever information we’re able to glean.
I just spoke with the representatives of the UK, and I think that their great prime minister is doing much better today, or at least better.  But certainly he’s had a tough bout, and he’s still going through a tough time, but he seems to be doing better.  And that’s good.
And we — we send our regards to Boris and his family and his friends, all of the people that really love him.  He’s — he’s become a very popular — before this happened, became a very popular prime minister.  He’s doing an excellent job.  He loves their country; he loves our country.  So we appreciate everything he’s done, and hopefully he’s going to be okay.
Speaking of great people, and people that have done a fantastic job, I have Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with us. And I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words.  And then I think what we’ll do, in order to get him back to the State Department, we’ll take some questions and we’ll then go on with the rest of what I’m going to say.  And then we’ll take some questions after that, and then Vice President Pence will take over.
So, Mike Pompeo, please.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Mr. President. Under the President’s leadership, my team and I at the State Department are doing our part to protect the American people from the virus and, importantly, to get them home.
As you know, when many countries shut down their rail lines, their buses, their infrastructure systems, the capacity to get out of those countries — they were trapped, they’re stranded — the State Department swung into action.
Since January 29th, we have now repatriated over 50,000 United States citizens back to their homes from more than 90 countries, more than 490 flights back to the United States from all across the world.  This worldwide scale of our repatriation efforts is without parallel in our lifetime.  We are coordinating with foreign governments, militaries, airport authorities, medical units, transportation companies, hotels, you name it.  We’re working with them to make sure the American people get back to be with their families.
You can see, behind me, the map of the flights, that we have brought back people —
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  — from all across the world.  Every day, I get a chance to hear some of the remarkable stories from our team.  Let me give you just a couple of examples.
Our mission in Peru: Working with the Peruvian military and police forces to send riverboats up the — up the river to get citizens that were stranded deep inside the Amazon forest.
Our mission in Nepal: Make sure that a woman who was running low on medication could get what she needed at a pharmacy before boarding an evacuation flight that brought her back here.
In Honduras: After the government imposed a very strict 24/7 curfew and closed airports, our embassy sprang into action for stranded Americans — thousands of them.
A three-year-old boy told one of our consular officers just before he boarded the flight, “Thank you for helping me get back home to my dad.”  Pretty neat.
We’ve received similar messages from lots of people.  They’re proud to know that their country will not leave them stranded and we’re going to get them back home.
One woman wrote, quote, “I was in tears when I received the e-mail approving our flight back to the United States.  God bless the United States of America.”  And another said, “I felt like I had allies there that actually treated me like a person or a family member, not just a number.”
The Repatriation Task Force at State Department, our consular officers have done great work.  I want to thank our partners in the Department of Defense who have helped with some of these flights back home and other government agencies — our sisters and brothers across the United States government in this administration that have helped get these people back.
And then, lastly, aside from our repatriation efforts, we continue to help countries around the world as well.  We’ve got CDC officials helping these countries with expertise and all the things that these countries need to get their citizens safe and healthy and back so that we can get the economy all across the world — the global economy — back on its feet when this crisis is over.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thanks, Mike.  Maybe you stick for a little while —

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
5:43 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Today, we continue to send our love to the great people of New York and New Jersey.  We support them fully.  We grieve alongside every family who has lost a precious loved one.  New Yorkers are tough and strong and brave.  New Jerseyites are tough and strong and brave, and they’re being hit very hard right now.  And for the next week, hopefully not much longer than that, it’s going to start to go in the other direction.
Our country is being hit hard, but some areas have done so incredibly well.  We’re so proud of them.  They will beat this virus.  We’re going to beat it with the grit and the heart for which they’re known and for which our country is known.  And we appreciate everything that everybody is doing.
We also — we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  He’s become a great friend of ours.  He loves this country; he loves his country.  But he loves the USA.  And he’s always been very good to us.  Whenever we had difficulty, he was with us, and we appreciate it.  So, we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  He’s going through a lot.
As we intensify our military campaign against the virus, I think that it must be brought out that we have to thank the American people for continuing to follow our guidelines on “slowing the spread” — an expression that more and more people are thinking about.  Nobody ever heard of it two months ago, and now everybody is talking about “slowing the spread,” stopping the spread.
Even during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope.  And this will be a very painful week.  And next week, at least part of next week, but probably all of it — look, if one person dies, it’s a painful week.  And we know that’s going to, unfortunately, happen.  This is a monster we’re fighting.
But signs are that our strategy is totally working.  Every American has a role to play in winning this war.  And we’re going to be winning it.  We’re going to be winning it powerfully.  And we’ll be prepared for the next one, should it happen, but hopefully it won’t.
Our massive airlift operation for critical supplies — it’s called Project Airbridge — continued today as five massive planes, flights, landed in the United States packed with personal protective equipment.  And our nation’s heroic healthcare workers will be the beneficiaries of that.  Twenty-seven more flights are scheduled in the near future, over the next couple of weeks.
The Army Corps of Engineers is constructing facilities that will support more than 15,000 hospital beds to treat patients in need.  So they’re building now approximately 15,000.  They just completed the big one in New York.  They just completed and are in the process of continuing in Chicago and many other places.  They’re incredible.  The Army Corps of Engineers — we owe them a lot.  What they’re able to do in such a short period of time — they’ll build these massive facilities.  Two thousand beds in four days.  So it’s really something very special.  I know, I was in the construction industry, and you don’t see that happen very often.
I want to remind governors and emergency managers that sharing real-time data with us about equipment and their needs is very important.  All of their supplies, hospital occupancy is critical.  A lot of the occupancy is really getting a little bit lower than anticipated, and that’s good.  We, sort of, thought that was going to happen.
And we’re getting along very well with the governors.  This whole situation with respect to talking to us about equipment and equipment needs — giving us a little bit of lead time — so important.  All the supplies — we’re getting it to everybody like they never thought possible.  But we’ll ensure that we can rapidly deploy federal assets where and when they’re needed, especially on ventilators.
We’re actually getting some ventilators back.  As you know, the State of California was great.  They sent some back, which they won’t need.  And Washington State, likewise.  And we have some others coming back, so we’re using them in areas we need them.
We are pressing forward aggressively on the scientific frontier of the medical war.  The companies I’ve spoke to — the four leading — I call them the “genius companies” — they’re doing incredibly well with respect to cures and also with respect to a vaccine that’s going to protect us — totally protect us.  And they have some great potential.  It’s going to take a little while yet, but they have some great potential. Some great early results.
And the governors have been working hard, and we are working hard with the governors.  There’s been great coordination, especially over the last little while.  We’ve given them a lot of equipment, a lot of ventilators.  But a lot of equipment of all types.  And I will protect you if your governor fails.  If you have a governor that’s failing, we’re going to protect you.  But the governors are working well with us over the last period of time.
Today, in our stockpile of ventilators — and again, we need the stockpile so we can immediately move them from place to place, wherever the monster hits.  It’s a monster.  We have 8,675 ventilators right now, in stock, ready to move.
And we have all sorts of incredible soldiers.  Our military is going to move them, should they be needed in, as an example, if we need additional in New York or the New York City area.  You have state; you have city.  And I spoke to Mayor de Blasio, and we really have a great, well-coordinated campaign with Mayor de Blasio.  It’s been really good.  I spoke to Governor Cuomo.  There’s been great coordination.  So, if they need something, we have it.
If Louisiana needs something, we have it.  Same thing with Michigan.  Same thing with Illinois.  There are certain spots that are very hot.  And we’ll see what happens, but we’ll know — pretty much, we’ll have time, and we’ll be able to move it.
In addition to the 8,675 ventilators, we have 2,200 arriving on April 13th.  We have 5,500 arriving on May 4th.  These are ones that we’re building, for the most part.  And we have, as you know, great companies building them — Ford, General Motors, GE.  We have, really, some great companies that are doing it.  On May 18th, we have 12,000.  On June 1st, we have 20,000.  On June 29th, we have 60,000 ventilators coming.  Sixty — 6-0.  So we have a total of 110,000 ventilators coming over a short period of time.  I don’t think we’ll need them.  Hopefully, we won’t need them.  I don’t think we’ll need anywhere near them.  But we’ll have them for the future, and we’ll also be able to help other countries who are desperate for ventilators.
The UK called today and they wanted to know, would it be possible to get 200.  And we’re going to work it out.  We got to work it out.  They’ve been great partners, the United Kingdom. And we’re going to work it out for them.  So they wanted 200. They needed them desperately.
We now have 10 drugs in active trials, with 15 more soon to follow, as well as 2 vaccine candidates in active clinical trials.  We’ll do whatever it takes to secure needed medical supplies and bring more production of essential medicines back to our shores.  We’re doing that.  We’re bringing them back to our shores.  A lot of these companies — they went a little bit haywire.  They went away from this great country and they had them produced elsewhere.  So, we’re going to start bringing them back.  I’ve been talking about that for a long time, not only with medical, but lots of other things.
America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world.  And I think that’s probably why we have more cases.  Because when you look at some of these very large countries, they — I know they — I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do, but they don’t report them.
We’ve performed 1.87 million tests to date.  So that’s 1 million 870 thousand — million tests.  Think of that: 1,870,000 tests to date.  And now we’re performing them at a level that nobody has ever seen before.
As we announced yesterday, CVS testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island will be using Abbott Labs rapid five-minute test. We’re down to now five minutes.  It’s a five-minute test so that people can get their results back very quickly.
And we’re actively engaging on the problem of increased impacts — this is a real problem, and it’s showing up very strongly in our data — on the African American community.  And we’re doing everything in our power to address this challenge.  It’s a tremendous challenge.  It’s terrible.  And provide support to African American citizens of this country who are going through a lot.  But it’s been disproportional.  They’re getting hit very, very hard.
In fact, while we have Tony here, I’d like to maybe have you come up and address that one, and then I’ll continue.  But if you could address that, it would be great, Tony.  Please.
DR. FAUCI:  Yeah.  Thank you, Mr. President.  We have a particularly difficult problem of an exacerbation of a health disparity.  We’ve known, literally forever, that diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma are disproportionately afflicting the minority populations, particularly the African Americans.
Unfortunately, when you look at the predisposing conditions that lead to a bad outcome with coronavirus — the things that get people into ICUs that require intubation and often lead to death, they are just those very comorbidities that are, unfortunately, disproportionately prevalent in the African American population.  So we’re very concerned about that.  It’s very sad.  There’s nothing we can do about it right now, except to try and give them the best possible care to avoid those complications.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And, Tony, I think you’re going to have some pretty accurate numbers over the next few days, right?  But they are very — they’re very nasty numbers.  Terrible numbers.
In total, 1,200 Abbott machines — Abbott Laboratories, they’ve been fantastic — have been shipped now nationwide.  Up to 500 more are being produced every week, and 50,000 testing cartridges are being manufactured per day.  That means a lot of very fast tests.  No nation in the world has developed a more diverse and robust testing capacity than the United States.
We’re dealing with other nations, helping them out because the testing is very tough for them.  And our tests are very accurate.  A lot of tests are out there, and they’re not accurate at all.  In fact, some of the tests, you don’t have a clue what’s going on.  So we’re working with other nations trying to get them help, also.
At a time when many Americans are experiencing increased stress, anxiety, and personal loss, we must also ensure that our country can meet the mental health needs of those struggling in this crisis.  There are people struggling.  They’re struggling.  And some people are getting to know each other, frankly.  Some families are getting to know each other, on a positive note.  But there are a lot of people struggling.
On Thursday, I’ll be speaking to leaders and advocates from the mental health organizations all across our country.  And we are going to be talking about resources and tools that we’ll make available to them.  They need help.  And it’s a big problem.
When you take something where it was the most successful country in the world — still is — the whole world is shut down.  Think of it: We’re down to numbers that are incredible.
As I said yesterday, I think it’s 182 countries right now.  One hundred and eighty-two countries are under attack by the — by the scourge, by this virus.
But as we wage medical war on the virus, we’re also speeding economic relief to our people.  It’s incredible.  We just had a meeting that was absolutely incredible with the banks.  I spoke with leaders in the banking and finance industry about our efforts to help American workers and employers.
As of today, small business has proc- — has processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much-needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already.
So we are going to be providing tremendous amounts of money to the small businesses of our country who have been absolutely clobbered.  And they’ll be keeping open and they’ll be paying their employees, and they’ll be all set to go.  We’re going to have a rocket upward.
I want to thank David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs; Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America; Gordon Smith, co-president, COO of JPMorgan Chase; Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo;  Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Al Kelly, CEO of Visa;  Michael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard; Noah Wilcox, CEO, chairman of Grand Rapids State Bank.  And we had numerous others also on the call.  And I just appreciate them.
They are — we’re way ahead of schedule, by the way.  We’re way ahead of schedule.  The Paycheck Protection Program has been incredible.
So based on the incredible success of the program, I’m announcing that I’ll be asking Congress to provide an additional $250 billion for the paycheck protection, which will help keep Americans employed to facilitate a quick and full recovery.
We’re doing very well.  We’re looking very bipartisan.  A lot of people want to do it.  And the — the plan is amazing.  You know, they’re processing hundreds of thousands of loans.  And this is the big banks that are doing it, the community banks.  But the biggest banks right now in our country are doing it, and they’re — they’re doing it for a lot of reasons.  One of them is they want to help people.
The WHO, that’s the World Health Organization, receives vast amounts of money from the United States.  And we pay for a majority — biggest portion of their money.  And they actually criticized and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.  And they were wrong.  They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.  And they had a lot of information early and they didn’t want to — they’re very — they seem to be very China-centric.  And we have to look into that.  So we’re going to look into it.
We pay for — we give a majority of the money that they get.  And it’s much more than that the 58.  Fifty-eight million dollars is a small portion of what they’ve gotten over the years.  Sometimes they get much more than that.  Sometimes it’s for programs that they’re doing, and — and it’s much bigger numbers.  And if the programs are good, that’s great, as far as we’re concerned.
But we want to look into it — World Health Organization — because they really are — they called it wrong.  They called it wrong.  They really — they missed the call.  They could have called it months earlier.  They would have known, and they should have known.  And they probably did know, so we’ll be looking into that very carefully.
And we’re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO.  We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we’re going to see.  It’s a great thing if it works, but when they call every shot wrong, that’s no good.
We’re in the midst of a great national struggle, one that requires the shared sacrifice of all Americans.  In recent weeks, it’s been remarkable to see so many companies and organizations and individuals, like the banks that I just told you about — biggest banks in the world.  They stepped up to help small business.  They have big business, small business.  The small business will someday be the big business.  But the small business is 50 percent of our economic strength.  People don’t realize when you add them up, but they just — they just rose to the occasion.  Everybody is rising to the occasion.  It’s been incredible to watch.
To honor and celebrate the extraordinary examples of patriotism and citizenship, we’re seeing — I’m asking Americans to use the hashtag #AmericaWorksTogether when sharing stories of how we’re all working together, get through — getting through this ordeal in a fashion that nobody would have ever thought possible.  It’s been incredible.  And that’s why the numbers are, so far, much better.  We want to keep it that way.
If you look at the original projections: If we did nothing, it would be disastrous.  If we — we decided to do something.  We closed it down; had no choice.  It was a good move.  That was a good move.  The early China move was a good move.  The early Europe move was a good move.  Made a lot of good moves.  But closing it down was a big statement.  It was a big, important thing.
But we’re looking to have far fewer deaths than originally thought.  And I think we’re heading in that direction, but it’s too early to talk about it.  I don’t even want to talk about it now because we just want to work.
And I think that people are doing an incredible job.  The doctors, the nurses, the firefighters, the police — all medical people, what they’re doing — the bravery that they’re displaying is just incredible.
Every citizen should take immense pride in the selfless — selflessness and all of the courage and compassion of our people.  The workers — the people that are working and construction workers going into hospitals, knowing nothing about this problem, other than it’s dangerous.  And they go in there to rebuild sections of hospitals.  And you have people in really big trouble right next door.  They know nothing about it.  All they know is they’re going to get it done, they’re going to fix that wing so they can have more people in there.  It’s incredible.
But this is a national spirit that won our independence and settled the frontier and explored the horizons of space.  And that’s what we’re doing.  I mean, this is all — this is all new territory.
It unlocked the miracles of science and what — we’re doing that when you — I wish you could have heard the calls I had yesterday with these great companies that come up with cures to diseases.  And the success they’ve had over the last 15 years is really amazing.  So I just want to thank all of them.  They’re working very hard.
They’re working with UK, right now, and the UK doctors — hopefully helping with their great Prime Minister.  But these people are really a — tremendous signs of success are staring us right in the face.  I think we’re going to have something that’s going to be great, in terms of vaccines and in terms of everything else that they’re doing, just helping — really helping us, helping the people of our country and helping, ultimately, the people of the world.
So I want to thank you all for being here.  I will take some questions, and then I’m going to give it over to the Vice President and they’re going to go into great detail on to what we’re doing and all of the successful supplies and medical equipment that we’re getting — all of the ventilators.  I’ve said it, but you can go over it in more detail if you’d like.  But we’re taking in and building thousands and thousands of ventilators.  And they’re very high quality.  I said, “You got to go for the quality.”  And these are quality companies doing it.
So — because there is a big difference between a good ventilator and a not-so-good ventilator, Tony, right?  We’ve seen that.  And — big difference.  So we’re going top of the line.
Steve, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-april-7-2020/

April 6, 2020
5:41 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  This week, America continues our aggressive effort to defeat the virus as we enter a crucial and difficult phase of the battle.
We continue to send our prayers to the people of New York and New Jersey, and to our whole country.  But right now, New York and New Jersey are very hot zones, and we’re with them.  We’re with everybody.  Your struggle is our struggle, and we will beat this virus.  We will beat it together.
I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery.  He’s been a really good friend.  He’s been really something very special.  Strong.  Resolute.  Doesn’t quit.  Doesn’t give up.
We have made tremendous progress on therapeutics.  I had a fantastic call today, which I’ll be talking about a little bit later.  And I’ve asked two of the leading companies — these are brilliant companies.  Ebola, AIDS, others.  They’ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs.  And I’ve asked them to contact London immediately.  They have offices in London.  They’re major companies.  But more than major, more than size, they’re genius.
And I had a talk with four of them today.  And they speak a language that most people don’t even understand, but I understand something: that they’ve really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically, and they have arrived in London already.  Their London office has whatever they need, and we’ll see if we can be of help.
We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place.  But they are ready to go.  But when you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.
So, the two companies are there.  And with what they are talking about — and it’s rather complex and has had really incredible results — we’re working with the FDA and everybody else, but we are working with London, with respect to Boris Johnson.
Across the country, we’re attacking the enemy on all fronts, including medical, scientific, social, logistical, and economic.  We’re pressing into action the full power of American government and American enterprise.  And our military has been incredible.  We’ve just sent 3,000 public health personnel.  They’re now deployed in the New York area, and they’ll be over at the Javits Center, over at the great ship.
And as you probably have heard — and I was informed that Governor Cuomo has already told you and announced — he called me up a little while ago, and he asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship, with respect to fighting the virus.  And we hadn’t had that in mind at all, but we’re going to let him do it, and we’re also going to let New Jersey.  Governor Murphy — we spoke with him a little while ago, and New Jersey is going to use it also because New Jersey is a hot — a hotspot.
So Governor Murphy and Governor Cuomo are going to be using the ship for New York, New Jersey.  And it’s a big ship, and it’s now COVID; it’s set for COVID.  And we are going to — hopefully that will be very helpful to both states.  The Javits Center, which is 2,900 beds, just built by our military, also is going to be manned now by the military.  And they should be in place tomorrow, and they’ll start sending quite a few people over to the Javits Center.  It’s convenient.  It’s right in the middle of everything.  So that’ll be something great.
And we appreciated Governor Cuomo’s nice — really nice statements and, likewise, Governor Murphy.  We have worked very well with both of them and with, frankly, all of the governors.  Vice President Pence had a call this morning with them that lasted for close to two hours.  And I understand there wasn’t a negative person on the call.  Fifty governors — or just about fifty governors — I think they were all on, from what I understood.  And they were very positive about everything their federal government has been doing for them.  And you’ll hear what that is, and it’s — it’s rather amazing, actually.
Nationwide, the Army Corps of Engineers is building 22 field hospitals — these are big hospitals — and alternate care sites in 18 states.  So you have a combination of 22 field hospitals.  In addition to that, we’re building alternate care sites, which is a little bit of a smaller version of the hospital.  And we have a lot of them, and they’re going up in 18 different states.
In total, we have deployed 8,450 hospital beds from federal stockpiles.  And, you know, if you think, this is done over a period of — really, a period of weeks.  It’s incredible, actually.  More than 8,000 ventilators have been sent from the National Stockpile to our cities and states, backed by the Defense Production Act, which we’ve used very strongly, very powerfully.  So powerfully that we don’t have to use it too much, frankly.  And it’s nice when you don’t have to.  We’re getting more than we ever bargained for.
American industry is stepping up.  Manufacturers are really going to town.  And we have thousands of ventilators being built as we speak, and we have hundreds that are being sent to different locations, and we’re ready to roll with almost 10,000 that we have in the federal stockpile.
When I say “ready to roll,” too, I mean exactly what that states: We are — wherever that monster goes, we’re able to move with it.  Great flexibility.  We have tremendous flexibility.  And we have people waiting, and they’re ready, willing, and able, but waiting to bring them wherever it may be, if they need it.  If they need it.  It’s possible that they won’t be needed, that we’re fully stocked, because numbers are coming in where, because of what the American people are doing, we’re having fewer hospital visits.  I think that could be the case in New York.  It could be the case in a few other states.  And fewer beds, fewer hospital visits mean fewer ventilators.  So we’ll see whether or not our original projections were right.
But anyway, I had a very good talk with both governors, and I think they’re very happy — extremely happy about the — what we’re doing for them, and especially going all COVID.  So that’ll take place almost immediately.
FEMA and HHS have directly distributed 11.7 million N95 respirators.  Think of that.  Get the number.  11.7 million N95 respirators.  11.7 million.  26.5 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22.6 million gloves.  22.6 million gloves.
We have also arranged for vast quantities of additional materials to be allocated through donations and existing supply chains.  We’ve also given tremendous medical material and supplies throughout the 50 states and territories.
And through Project Airbridge, we have succeeded in bringing planeloads of vital supplies into the United States from overseas.  We had an additional three.  These are massive planes, by the way.  The big planes — they’re very big, very powerful, and they’re loaded to the gills with supplies.  And rather than bringing them into our stockpile, as we’ve discussed, we bring them to all the different locations where they’re needed so we can save a big step and a timely step.
Because of my actions, under the DPA, I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement — a very amicable agreement — with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high-quality facemask — facemasks each month.  So that we’re going to be getting, over the next couple of months, 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers.
So the 3M saga ends very happily.  We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M and its CEO, Mike Roman.  I just spoke with him and I thanked him for getting it done.  And Mike was very happy to get it done.  It’s a great company.  So we’re getting 166.5 million masks, and mostly that’s going to be for our frontline healthcare workers.  Okay?  That’s 3M.  Thank you, 3M.
I also want to thank Apple, one of the many great American companies that’s taken into — that’s really leapt into action.  Today, Apple announced that it is now producing plastic face shields for healthcare workers at the rate of 1 million per week.  One million.  And these are the shields that you see on television quite a bit.  And they’re at the highest level of quality and safety.
We’re grateful, as well, to Salesforce, which has donated 48 million pieces of personal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, suits, and face shields.  So thank you very much to Salesforce.
I urge all of our nation’s governors to ensure that the massive deliveries that we’ve made to your states over the past few weeks are distributed as quickly as possible.
So again, we’re working very well with the governors.  Now, they may see you and say, “Oh, we’re not happy.”  But they’re very happy on the phone.  And Mike Pence is a straight shooter, and he had a great phone conversation to them, with all of the governors.  Teleconference.  And they’re very happy, every one of them.
Were there any negatives?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  No, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  See?  I told you.  Mike is the greatest.  Mike — and you have done a great job, Mike, and I appreciate it.  The whole country appreciates it.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.
Anthony appreciates it, right?  Aren’t you — see?  Everybody appreciates Mike.  A special man.
So a lot of the things that we’ve done, again, are going directly to the states.  The states seem to be very happy.  If they’re not, they can call me directly, they can call Mike directly, and we’ll make them happy.  But tremendous progress has been made in a very short period.
And I think, very importantly, the progress has been made before the surge comes, because the next week, week and a half, is going to be a big surge, the professionals tell us.  And I think we’re in good shape for it, Anthony.  So it’s good timing.  Really good timing.  We can have the stuff there.  It’s already there, for the most part, but we’re bringing a lot of different resources to the various locations, especially where the surge is looking like it’s going to take place.
Resources from the National Stockpile need to reach our warriors.  And they are warriors.  I tell it all the time.  I saw it again this morning, these young, in many cases — in many cases, older — but they’re walking into the hospital, and they’re putting on — I mean, as that door is opened, they’re going into this place, and, you know, it’s not exactly too safe.  And they’re going in there and they’re putting the outfits on and they’re putting their masks on, and they’re — it’s incredible.  It’s no — it’s truly — it’s like no different than you watch the war movies or you watch the old clips of war, running up hills.  It’s — to me, it’s the same thing.
Men and women, young and old, but a lot of young people, just going in there.  They’re not thinking about, “Oh, gee, this is dangerous.”  They’re not saying, “Oh, I don’t want to go in.”  They’re — they’re warriors.  They’re running through those doors.  It’s the most incredible thing.  It’s a beautiful — it’s an incredible, beautiful thing.
Resources from the National Stockpile need to reach these warriors in the hospitals immediately, and we’re making sure they do.  And again, the states have that responsibility, but we’re working with the states and we’re getting the states a lot of things that they can distribute.  Or when they tell us, we bring it directly to the hospital from the federal stockpile, or from the planes that land without even going to the stockpile.
If any state is having difficulty distributing supplies, we urge you to use the National Guard to assist in the delivery.  And I have to say, you have done a fantastic job.
Deborah, you know that you’ve done great.  Tony, you know that you’ve done great.
But what a job you’ve done.  And I appreciate it.  I really do.  Your whole group has been incredible.  That’s a lot of stars you have.  I’ll tell you that.  He’s supposed to do a great job when you have four stars, right?
But the military has been incredible, and I thank them for all of us.
Conversely, if a state believes that it has surplus equipment or supplies — very important, because we actually have gotten so much to some of the states that they’re able to now — they’ve done a fantastic job and they’ve kept — they’ve kept that line low.  And we have some states that have surplus equipment and supplies, and they’re working with us to rapidly redeploy those supplies to areas of greatest need.  We thought that might happen.  If it worked out well, that’s what was going to happen, and it’s happening.
And I want to thank Governor Gavin Newsom, who’s doing a tremendous job, who’s announced California will send 500 ventilators to be distributed to other locations.  I think some are going to Arizona.  Some are going to Washington, D.C.  We think they’re going to Delaware.  We’re working it out.  But 500 excess ventilators from the State of California.  And we’re going to get them taken care of wherever they have to go.  Those decisions are being made right now.
The members of the White House Task Force and I are in close touch with mayors and governors and hospital administrators across our country.  And we’re told that the present time — at the present time, most of the critical needs are — are being more than met.  States have to continue sharing detailed information in the amount and utilization rates of medical supplies so we know what to resupply them.  Or they can get it directly; that includes ventilators.  They can get it directly.  Ideally, if they can get it directly, but if they can’t, if they’re unable to do it, we have tremendous amounts of supplies.  And we’re building it up very fast too.  And this is before the big surge.
This information is fundamental to our ability to deliver the material when — when and where it’s most needed.
Now, Mike, in his conversation today, I think got some information as to a couple of locations where we’re going to be delivering large numbers of ventilators and large numbers of medical supplies.  And we’ll take care of that.
But some of the states are very happy.  Even Governor Pritzker, from Illinois, is happy.  Of course, he may not be happy when he talks to the press, but he’s happy.  He’s a very happy man.
We’re increasingly hopeful that the aggressive mitigation strategy we put into place will ultimately allow our hospital system to successfully manage the major influx of cases that — that we have right now.  Again, I say that we’re finding, because of the incredible job done by the American people in conjunction with everybody — governors, the military, federal government, state government, local government — had a lot of conversations with New York City and Mayor de Blasio.  I’ve gotten to know him.  I didn’t know him.  Gotten to know him.  And a lot of people are working hard.  Everybody is working hard.  A lot of people are doing a great job — I’ll tell you that.  A lot of people are doing a great job.
But the goals that all Americans have been sacrificing to achieve these last few weeks are things that a lot of people thought were not possible to achieve.  And I think we’ve more than achieved, but we have to go through.
Again, we’re going to have a rough week.  We’re going to have maybe a rough a little more than a week.  And — but there’s tremendous light at the end of that tunnel.  I said it last time.  I said it last night: There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.  There’s so many things happening with therapeutics, with vaccines, with things that we really want.
Deborah, Tony, they’re all working so hard on this.  But those therapeutics — I mean, look, the vaccines are going to be always a little bit later because of that testing period, but the therapeutics — getting the kind of things that I heard about today, talking to these brilliant companies and brilliant people on the phone was fantastic.  It was such an incredible conversation.
And I also spoke, just a few minutes ago, with Vice President — former Vice President Biden, who called.  And we had a really wonderful, warm conversation.  It was a very nice conversation.  We talked about pretty much this.  This is what we talked about.  This is what everyone is talking about.  This is what they want to talk about.  And he gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that.  And we just had a very friendly conversation.  It lasted probably 15 minutes, and it was really good.  It was really good.  Really nice.  I think it was very much so.  I appreciate his calling.
As we continue our efforts to develop treatments and cures, this afternoon I spoke with leaders of the American pharmaceutical companies.  And just to give you their names: Amgen, Genentech, Gilead, Regeneron.  These are four the greatest in the world for doing exactly what they’re doing.
And currently, 10 different therapeutic agents are in active trials and some are looking incredibly successful, but we have to go through a process.  And it’s going to be a fairly quick process, I will tell you, based on what the FDA told me.  And another 15 are in plans for clinical trials.  So they’re advancing rapidly.
And today, a second company announced that the FDA has authorized its vaccine candidate to begin clinical trials.  So you have — Johnson & Johnson is already there.  I believe they’re the one that’s first.  And now we have a second company that just — just announced.  And we were just — it was just approved.  So we have two companies at that level for the vaccine itself.
We’ve now performed 100 — well, if you think of this: 1.79 million tests.  That’s 1,790,000 tests nationwide.  And I think we’re going to put up a screen here someplace.  Good.  They’re on cue.  They’re just on cue.  And here it is.  This is the process starting on 5 March and ending right there.  Right about now.  Right?  That’s about it.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Yesterday.
THE PRESIDENT:  So — and it’s going up at a rapid rate.  Nobody has done more testing.
And one of the reasons why they say — and I think I can say this, Deborah, very strongly — but one of the reasons that we have more cases is we’ve done more testing.  If I went to some of these countries that have, in my opinion, far more people than we do, that had the problem, and if we did the kind of testing proportionately that we’re doing, they’d have many more cases than us.  But we have more cases because we do much more testing.
So when you do the testing, you have cases.  Otherwise, you wouldn’t know about the cases.  People sit home; you don’t know about it.
But we have now done 1,790,000 tests nationwide.  That’s more than any other country in the world, hence we have more cases.  And that number is growing by nearly 125,000 people per day.  Think of that one.  So it’s growing by 125,000 people per day.
I told you about South Korea.  This is a, you know, vastly faster — and we also have, they say, the most accurate of tests.
CVS is launching — and they’ve been great — two new drive-through testing sites in Atlanta, Georgia, and Providence, Rhode Island.  And each location will be able to test up to 1,000 patients per day using the ultra-fast five-minute test developed by Abbott Labs.  Now they’re down to five minutes.  They call it the “ultra-fast” and it’s very accurate.  Abbott Labs, I want to thank them.  They’ve been fantastic.
We’re also speeding urgent economic relief to the American worker and families and the employers.  As of today, tens of thousands of small businesses have applied for more than $40 billion in relief under the Paycheck Protection Program.  You’ve all been reading about it.  And it’s really — I mean, it’s only been going for a couple of days.  It’s really been performing well.  A couple of little glitches — minor glitches that have already been taken care of, what they say.
These funds will result in nearly 2 million jobs being preserved.  So we’re taking care of our workers — small businesses and our workers.
Nearly 3,000 lenders have already made loans under the program, and we’re signing up additional lenders very quickly — rapidly.
Community banks have been very responsive, and larger banks are also stepping up.  If this — if we run out of funds — by the way, we’re already preparing because it’s going so fast for the small businesses and their employees — we’ll ask Congress to refill it immediately.  But the banks have been great.  The big banks — the Bank of America was right up there at the beginning.  JPMorgan Chase was — has been great.  After the first day, they really — they really came through, and a lot of the big banks.  But the community banks have been fantastic.
As we announced last week, we are providing $100 billion in direct support for our hospitals.  And the first tranche, $30 billion, will be distributed this week.
So I want to — I want to say one other thing.  Our farmers — we love our farmers — and, as you know, as of April 1st, the China trade deal — 250-billion-dollar — they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more.  And of that, approximately $50 billion is expected to be with our farmers.
So it kicked in as of April 1st, and we’ll see how it goes.  It seems like they’re buying.  So we’ll let you know how that’s going.  But they’re buying anywhere from $40- to $50 billion worth of our agricultural product.  That should have a huge impact on our farmers — a tremendous impact on our farmers.  But we’re watching it very closely.
To fight the medical war, we’ve mobilized the unbeatable — and it just — it is unbeatable — strength of American determination, ingenuity, and compassion.  I got to see that when I spoke to the great science — because I call them “science companies” more than drug companies.  They’re scientists.
We’ve seen businesses, charities, and private citizens making generous donations.  So many people are making donations.  We’ve seen states and cities supporting and helping each other and caring for our citizens.  And we’ve seen Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs uniting together to answer the challenge and rise to the moment.  And that’s what they’re doing.
Above all, we have been awe-inspired by the exceptional courage of the doctors, nurses, EMTs, and healthcare workers who are the soldiers of this war.  No words can ever express the complete measure of our gratitude for these intrepid heroes.
One Cleveland patient credited his medical team for not only saving his life through their skill, but forever changing his life through their example of selfless devotion.  Couldn’t believe it — so generous he was with his statements.  And he talked about their bravery in an area that was in such trouble — an area of that hospital where people were dying.  And he talked about their bravery.
Another survivor in Houston said simply, “I will consider them my angels forever.”  “I will consider them” — think of that — “my angels forever.”
As our nation endures the depths of loss and grief, we are also witness to the summit of American virtue, character, and courage.  With the love and dedication of every American patriot, we will win this battle, we will defeat this enemy, and we will rise from this present crisis with new strength, unity, and resolve.  And that’s what’s happening.
Tremendous stories are coming out of this horrible moment. A very dark moment for the world.  One hundred and eighty two.  I was saying 151 for a while, and then it got up to 160.  And it’s 182, as I announced yesterday.  A hundred and eighty-two countries are being attacked by this virus.
So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to thank the American citizens for doing a great job.  Stay inside.  And let’s win this, and let’s get our country open as soon as we can.  I think it’s going to be sooner than people think.  Things are going really well.  Again, light at the end of the tunnel.
And with that, I’ll take a few questions.  And then Mike is going to take over and talk with the Admiral and with the professionals.  And we appreciate you being here.
Yes, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-21/

April 5, 2020
6:59 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  All these people have been working very, very hard today, I’ll tell you.  For a long time, they’ve been working.
But before I begin, I want to express our nation’s well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus.  All Americans are praying for him.  He’s a friend of mine.  He’s a great gentleman and a great leader.  And he’s — as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I’m hopeful and sure that he’s going to be fine.  He’s a strong man, a strong person.
Today, every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey.  They’ve really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening.  In New York, the first time where the deaths were less from the previous day.  That’s the first drop so far.  So maybe that’s a good sign; it could be.  And the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease.  It’s been very short, but perhaps decrease.
So we wish Governor Cuomo and all of the people in New York great.  And, New Jersey, your governor is doing a great job.  He’s doing a great job in New Jersey.  They got hit very hard.
I just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprise — it really is.  This is an all-out military operation that we’ve waged, and especially over the last number of weeks.  Fifty states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual.
Thanks to the Army Corps of Engineers, New York City’s Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States.  It’s designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two Army hospital units, and they’re doing a great job.  This was something that we didn’t expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops — not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders.  People are now running Javits.
Also, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York — there’s been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all.  That was not supposed to be for the virus at all, under any circumstances. But it looks like, more and more, we’re going to be using it for that.  So we’ll see.  That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it’s very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road, no — no anything on the road.  Things that would normally be taken care of, we don’t see anymore.  So we haven’t seen that in a long time.  It’s, perhaps, a positive.
But the ship is ready.  And if it has to, if we need it — if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that.  They’d prefer not, for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it’s ready, willing, and able.
We have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world.  And we’re orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done.  We’ve never done anything like this.  And, more and more, we’re using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdictions, states — in particular New York, New Jersey, the Connecticut area.  Long Island now has become a hotspot — part of New York.  We’re sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we’re sending personnel where it’s needed.  Military personnel.
As of Tuesday, we’ll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country — 3,000 — and that number is going up.  And we hope we’re seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all.  So we’ll see.  You’ll be seeing that over the next few days.  Let’s see what happens.  But we’re prepared.
In the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of Earth.  They’re coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States, where the equipment isn’t as necessary.
Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost — listen to this — 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns.  And many more fully loaded cargo planes are right now on the way.  Three big ones landed today.  And these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that that massive amount of material that we’re getting in is being delivered all over the country.
Tomorrow, we’ll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system.  It was requested — Mayor de Blasio.  We’ve been working great with Mayor de Blasio, getting him a lot of stuff.  He’s working very hard; I can tell you that.  And we’re working, really, very hard with New York City and with New York State.
And at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin, out in Long Island, we will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County, where they need it very badly.  So we’re getting that out on an emergency basis.  It should be there tomorrow.
We’ll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Polowczyk will detail shortly.  The Admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes.
Over the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey.  Five hundred.  And again, the governor has been very thankful.  We’re working very hard with New Jersey, including building hospitals.
We’ve also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana — a definite hotspot.  Three hundred to Michigan — working very well, I think, with the governor.
Amazingly, 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois.  And, I mean, there’s a governor — I hear him complaining all the time — Pritzker.  I hear him; he’s always complaining.  And yet, I just said, “Give me a list of a couple of the things we’ve done in Illinois.”  And we’re building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place; that’s the big convention center in Chicago.  And we’re helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he’s not able to do what you’re supposed to be able to do as a governor.  He has not performed well.
And we’re also sending 100 ventilators to Massachusetts.
So we have 600 to Illinois.  We have 100 to Massachusetts.  We have 300 to Michigan.  We have 200 to Louisiana.  We have 500 ventilators — 500 — going to New Jersey.  And this is being done by FEMA.  It’s being delivered by FEMA.  And it’s — that’s some job.  Just think of that.  When you think about 500 ventilators, a ventilator is a big deal.
We’re also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington, D.C., area to help Washington, D.C., and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C.
At the same time, Governor Inslee — we appreciate this — of Washington State has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country.  So the State of Washington has done very well.  They won’t be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent — about 400.  That’s a lot.  And we appreciate that he’s able to give them back.  He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks, until we can declare a final victory.
In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic.  Our warriors in this life-and-death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight.  We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support.  They make all of us very proud.  Our country is very proud.  We have people — they love our country.  The world loves our country, most of it.  Probably all of it; they just don’t say it.
I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results — gotten results of 1.67 million people.  That’s far more than any other country has been able to do.  And you remember, we inherited a broken system.  So a lot of this has been developed.
By Tuesday, 1,200 brand-new rapid point-of-care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories.  A great company.  And they’ll be distributed to all of our public health labs — that’s a 15-minute test; even less — as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and the Strategic National Stockpile.
So we’re going to have 1,200.  And on a weekly basis, we’re making a lot more.  They go very fast.  They’re very accurate tests.  And other countries are wanting them.  So, at the right time, we’ll be able to do that.  But right now, we’re getting them to all of ours.
So we’ve done 1,670,000 tests.  Think of that: 1,670,000 tests.  And we have a great system now.  We’re working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system.
And the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxychloroquine — hydroxychloroquine — which I think — as you know, it’s a great malaria drug.  It’s worked unbelievably.  It’s this powerful drug on malaria.  And there are signs that it works on this.  Some very strong signs.  And, in the meantime, it’s been around a long time.  It also works very powerfully on lupus.  Lupus.
So there are some very strong, powerful signs, and we’ll have to see.  Because again, it’s being tested now.  This is a new thing that just happened to us — the “invisible enemy,” we call it.
And, if you can, if you have a — no signs of heart problems, the azrithromycin [sic] — azithromycin — which will kill certain things that you don’t want living within your body — it’s powerful drug — if you don’t have a problem, a heart problem, we would say: Let your doctor think about it.  But as a combination, I think they’re going to be — I think they’re two things that should be looked at very strongly.
Now, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxychloroquine — 29 million.  A lot of drugstores have them by prescription, and also — and they’re not expensive.  Also, we’re sending them to various labs, our military.  We’re sending them to the hospitals.  We’re sending them all over.
I just think it’s something — you know the expression, I’ve used it for certain reasons: “What do you have to lose?”  What do you have to lose?  And a lot of people are saying that when — and are taking it — if you’re a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good.  But what do you have to lose?  They say, “Take it.”
I’m not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this.  If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early.  But we have some very good signs.  So that’s hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
And, again, you have to go through your medical people, get the approval.  But I’ve seen things that I sort of like.  So what do I know?  I’m not a doctor.  I’m not a doctor.  But I have common sense.  The FDA feels good about it.  They’ve — as you know, they’ve approved it.  They gave it a rapid approval.  And the reason: because it’s been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential.  So, based on that, we have sent it throughout the country and we have it stockpiled — about 29 million doses.  Twenty-nine million doses.  We have a lot of it.  We hope it works.
Driven by the goal of the brightest minds in science — we have the brightest minds in science, but we’re driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus.  These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.  We are working very, very hard.  I have met many of the doctors that are doing it.  These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus.
They’re staying — we strongly recommend staying at home, practicing vigorous hygiene, and maintaining social distance, so you’re — you’re just not going to catch it.  It’s the most effective weapon in this war.
And I will tell you, the — we are committing to the — to you.  We’re committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before.  They are — they are working so hard.  I see them.  I see them before my eyes, exhausted — people that I’m dealing with every day, exhausted.  They haven’t left their offices.  They haven’t left their hospitals.  We meet with them.  We see them.
And tremendous strides have been made.  I think the vaccines — we’ll have a report on that.  But the vaccines — we’re working together with other countries.  We’re also working with other countries — many other countries.  And we all want everyone else to be first.  We’re very happy.  But we are very far down the line on vaccines.  We’ll see how that all works.  Johnson & Johnson is doing a great job, working very hard.  A vaccine would be great.  Therapy — a therapy and therapeutics would be great.  We’ll see what happens.  In the meantime, you may listen to what I said about the two drugs mentioned.
My administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history.  You’ve seen what’s been happening.  Billions of dollars in small- business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Programs.
So we went out on Friday and, literally, it’s become so popular.  It’s been worked with the banks.  They get it to the small business.  It’s all about employment.  It’s all about jobs.  We want you to keep your jobs.  It gives small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll.  And we’re sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest-hit industries.  We’re saving industries.  We will be — you’ll be seeing it.  And if we do more, we’re going to do more, and we’re going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard.
But we’re going to take care of our workers.  We’re going to take care of our citizens.  We’re going to take care of our small businesses.  We’re going to take care of our large businesses: the airplane industry, the — the airline industry.  A lot of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time.
These are industries that were doing better — for the most part, doing better than ever.  The airlines were doing great.  Oil was doing great — oil and gas.  And the energy industry was doing phenomenally well, and it got hit like nobody has ever been hit before.  Just about like no industry has ever been hit before.  There’s never been anything like this.
But we see light at the end of the tunnel.  Things are happening.  Things are happening.  We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel.  And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we’ll be very proud of the job we all did.  We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we’re going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum — the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus.
In closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world.  While we may be apart from one another, as you can see from our great churches, our great pastors and ministers are out there working very hard.  But we may be apart — we can use this time to turn to reflection and prayer and our own personal relationship with God.
I would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle.  I had mentioned yesterday, where I see the nurses rushing into hospitals, and they’re putting on their outfits, and they’re putting on their masks and goggles, in some cases.  They’re rushing into war.  They’re rushing into war.
And I see people from apartment houses screaming and shouting and singing their praises.  It’s an incredible thing.  They’re warriors — these doctors and nurses.  They’re running into buildings, and they’re literally putting it on as the doors are opening.  They’re putting all their stuff and running inside.  And they’re running inside to tremendous danger.  Tremendous danger.
But, most of all, I’d like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones.  Ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief.  It’s a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world.
This morning — I was talking 151.  For four days, I said 151.  A hundred and fifty-one countries.  This morning, it’s 182 countries.  It jumped up a lot.  So, as of this morning, it’s 182 countries are under attack from this monster.
With the faith of our families and the spirit of our people, and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail.  We have learned so much.  We will be stronger than ever.
And I just want to thank everybody.  I want to thank the incredible professionals on the task force also.  We had a big meeting today.  We — were calls all day long to so many different people.  And I think our package to get everyone working when we’re ready is really turning out to be successful.  We may have to make it larger because it’s been really successful.  But all of that comes back to this country.  We want to get them back.  We want to get our people back to work.  Everybody wants to be back.  We want to open up our country as soon as possible.
So, with that, I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to say a few words, and she’s got some charts to show you.  And thank you very much.  Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  As you can see from the hopeful signs in Italy and Spain, where we see, finally, new cases and deaths declining, it’s giving us hope of what our future could be.
We wanted to give you an update on where all of the states were.  We’re looking at this as states normalized per 100,000 citizens.  It looks very similar to last week.  We wanted to update you.  We’ve been covering throughout the week the states that were moving on this map.
You can see very clearly where New York is as a state, although this is very much still centered in the New York metro area.  New Jersey is the orange line.  The green line is Louisiana.  That’s followed by Massachusetts, and then Connecticut and Michigan are together in those lines towards the bottom.  And then, of course, Washington, D.C., is now visible on this map, which was not visible before.  And the yellow line towards the bottom is Washington State.
Next slide, please.
So this just summarize all of the states we’re tracking very closely at the county level.  So we’re tracing and tracking not only the epidemic at the state level, but understanding what’s happening in county by county with new cases and, of course, also the deaths.
We’re also triangulating that with all of the laboratory data.  And just to tell you how we’re kind of doing that: For New York, which you can see at the top, their serology is now about 36 percent positive.  They were in the 40s.  So, day over day, their percent positive is finally starting to decline.  New Jersey’s is increasing, however.  They’re now up to 42 percent of the specimens that come to the laboratory are positive.  Louisiana, 25 percent.  Massachusetts, 20 percent.  Connecticut and Michigan, 20 percent.  District of Columbia, 15 percent.  Washington, 8 percent.  And then, Illinois and Colorado are at about 16 percent.  Pennsylvania, which is also new to the graphic, is it about 12 percent.
Next slide, please.
So, if we could go back one — I’m sorry.  If you go back one slide.  One more.  All of the states here, those are 38 of the states.  Thirty-eight of our states have less than 50 cases per hundred thousand.  They are testing.  Their laboratory results are consistent with that.  Their seropositivity rate for their laboratories are less than 5 percent.
So this is how we’re tracking and triangulating both case reporting, mortality or fatalities, and also triangulating that with the laboratory.
The New York metro area, New Jersey, Louisiana, and a series — and Washington State — have all tested at a rate greater than Italy and Spain.  I know many of you are tracking that. Remember, many of us, we pushed out a lot of those assays at the beginning, over the last two to three weeks.  And I want to just thank Admiral Giroir and HHS, who’s been working very closely to make sure that the states that were having an outbreak had access to all of their assays.
Next slide, please.  And then next one.
So just to give you an idea of how we’re looking at this, we look at cases every day.  I want to just thank my data team.  They spend all evening compiling data.  I get it about 2 o’clock in the morning.  And it looks at all of these metro areas by their granular counties.  So we can see the counties that have new cases.  That also helps us identify the hospitals and understand what hospitals will need ventilators or PPE.
So, this is the Detroit area; it’s Oakland and Detroit. Wayne County.
Next slide.
We also then — also track mortality.  It gives us insight into how many clients are in the ICU and need care.  And we want to make sure that we’re meeting the needs both on cases and really appreciating the frontline healthcare workers that are really saving many people’s lives.
Next slide.
This just gives you an idea from New Orleans.  We are now also tracking St. John the Baptist Parish also.  But this was the New Orleans and Jefferson County, and really tracking those on a case-by-case basis to look for changes over time.  And next slide is their mortality.  And you can see it’s starting to stabilize.
So this is how we’ve been tracking and tracing the epidemic as it moves through states and counties and communities.  But as we started, we just wanted to note again: We do see hopeful signs in Spain and Italy.  They have completed nearly four weeks of mitigation with people really doing social distancing, staying at home, ensuring they were washing their hands.  If they have to go out to the grocery store, they’re extraordinarily careful; they send one person from the family.
And so we can really see that beginning to work, and we’re very hopeful that, over the next week — although we’ll see rising number of cases of people who lose their lives to this illness — we’re also hopeful to see a stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago.
So thank you for your attention.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Admiral?  Please.
REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you, sir.  What I thought I would do is update on the average first, and then follow up on Dr. Birx and how we’re geographically aligning the supply chain.
So the average: We had three additional flights come in today, bringing a million gowns, 2.8 million N95 masks, 2.8 million surgical masks, 11.8 million gloves, 18.6 thousand gowns on three flights.  And that material will be pushed out across the nation, delivered to hospitals, nursing homes across the country.
Dr. Birx went through the geography.  And so, over the last few days, I’ve been aligning the supply chain to those areas, and then reaching down into those areas and extracting data from those areas on PPE burn rates.
So, for example, I spent the weekend talking to the chief operating officer of Detroit, Hakim Berry, for example, and talked to the leadership at Detroit Medical Center, Audrey Gregory; talked to the health officer at Oakland County, Michigan; and then also with the Chicago health officer, Dr. Allison Arwady.  So, reaching down to the — to a level to understand their needs.
So we’re geographically aligning the supply chain.  Right?  So you can see Dr. Birx went through these counties, and we’re getting down to the county level.  And then aligning it by priorities of point of care: public hospitals, first, VA hospitals, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care.
Over the coming days, we will be making a push to the geographic areas that Dr. Birx mentioned — increasing the volume through the supply chain to those areas to give them weeks, not just days’ worth of supply — primarily using our industry partners that we are directing: Cardinal, McKesson, Medline, Owen & Minor, Henry Schein, Concordance Healthcare — directing them to put product to the hospital door, the nursing home door, the first responders, directly to them.
We’re also working to push out millions of doses of hydrochlor- —
THE PRESIDENT:  Hydroxy.
REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Hydroxychlorine [sic].  Right.
We are working the distribution there to push the same thing to the same impacted areas, working to get it into hospitals and to every pharmacy.
And so my team is back there right now working the arrangements to make — make that to the hospital front door and primarily to the local pharmacies so a doctor can write those prescriptions and you can get it prior to having to go to a hospital.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you very much, Admiral.  Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Robert Wilkie, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, good.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I know you didn’t see him.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.  My last appearance here, I mentioned that the President had given the Department of Veterans Affairs very specific instructions to be as aggressive as possible in response to the virus crisis, not only to protect veterans but also to help the American people.
As many of you know, we have three primary missions at VA: One is to support veterans health.  The other is to provide veterans with benefits.  And the third is memorial services.  But we have a fourth mission, and that is to support the nation in times of national emergency, both in war and in peace.
We provide a bridge from the federal government to the states and localities during these emergencies.  As a result of that, I have ordered our veterans hospitals to begin preparing more than 1,500 beds to make them available both at the ICU and the acute-care level to the states and localities across the country.  As a result of that, we have opened up approximately 100 beds in the metropolitan New York area, in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan, and East Orange, New Jersey.
We will be informing the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, tomorrow, that we will give him access to our VA Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, to come to the aid of the people of the Pelican State.
I’ve also given instructions to initiate the fourth mission in Michigan.  We will be providing the people of Michigan access to hospital beds in both Ann Arbor and in Detroit.  We’ve also provided a pharmaceutical trailer to be used by the governor of Michigan, at Cobo Hall, to support the citizens of Michigan who will be coming into that facility for medical care.
We have also informed the state — the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that we will be helping them in their efforts to protect their most vulnerable citizens in two of their nursing homes.
So, in accord with the President’s instructions, the 400,000 men and women of the Department of Veterans Affairs are in this fight.  We are in the fight not only for the nine and a half million veterans who are part of our service, but we are in the fight for the people of the United States.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Robert.
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Mike?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And you all have just heard from several members of the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are — we are truly blessed to have the kind of leadership that we have.
And whether it be Admiral Polowczyk, who is organizing the distribution of tens of millions of supplies; whether it be Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, who are analyzing the data literally hour by hour; or whether it be that whole-of-government approach that you stood up, Mr. President, calling on every agency of government, including the VA, HHS, and every agency — I hope the American people know, at this President’s direction, we are — we are sparing no expense.  We are doing whatever it takes.  We’re marshaling the full resources of the federal government to respond to the challenges facing communities impacted today by the coronavirus and making sure every community in America has the support.
We’ve also — as the President has said so many times, we forged a seamless partnership with states around the country.  As the President just reflected, by this Tuesday, with another 840 military medical personnel arriving in New York City, there will be some 3,000 Department of Defense and HHS personnel on the ground to supplement and to provide relief to healthcare workers, really, at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the New York City area.  And you just heard the VA is opening up — opening up bed space.
In New Jersey, I spoke, at the President’s urging today, with Governor Murphy.  Five hundred ventilators, announced today, being built on the supplies that we have already provided.  We were able to coordinate with him to extent all federal coordination on testing in New Jersey through May the 30th, if the need is there, and also opening up VA beds.
I spoke with Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana and was encouraged to hear from him that, as you heard Dr. Birx say, that new cases were down slightly.  In fact, we’re seeing a trend of some leveling among all the governors I spoke to today.  And I know what the Secretary of the VA just announced — about opening up VA facilities — has been a priority for Governor Edwards, but I assured him we’re going to continue to send resources and supplies and personnel to support their healthcare.
In Michigan today, I spoke to both the governor, Gretchen Whitmer; and Mayor Mike Duggan of the city of Detroit.  Governor Whitmer and I spoke about a new program in Detroit that will make hydrochloroquine available for 3,000 patients through the Henry Ford Hospital.  They’ll be tracking, in a formal study, the results of that.
But at the President’s urging, I assured her that we’re more than prepared to make hydrochloroquine broadly available to pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the Detroit area as they deem appropriate.
I also heard from Mayor Mike Duggan, as I told you, Mr. President.  And he was so grateful to the FDA, not only for approving the Henry Ford Hospital tests that will be exploring hydrochloroquine, but also for the rapid approval of the 15- minute test.  In fact, Mayor Duggan told me that he was able to use the 15-minute test this weekend to test 150 first responders who had been sidelined because they’d been exposed to the coronavirus.  They all got the 15-minute tests.  They’re all back in the line of duty.  And the mayor couldn’t have been more grateful.
In Illinois, I spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker, as well as Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago.  As you just heard, not only have we sent 600 ventilators to the State of Illinois, but I assured — I assured the governor, I assured the mayor that while the principal focus that we have in the next several days is on the rising cases in the Greater New York City area and Louisiana, that Michigan and Illinois are in the forefront of our thinking.  And at the President’s direction, we’re going to make sure the people of Illinois and the people of Michigan have the resources, equipment, and support that they need.
The governor did express great appreciation for the fact that our Army Corps of Engineers had constructed 500 beds at McCormick Place, and before the end of this week would construct another 2,500 beds for an overflow healthcare facility in Chicago.
In fact, Mr. President, Mayor Lightfoot told me that the Army Corps was just outstanding in the job that they have been doing in constructing that extra bed space.
As I close, let me just — let me just express, as the President did, our profound appreciation for Governor Kate Brown and Governor Jay Inslee.  The State of Oregon and the State of Washington are leading by example.  Oregon sent 140 ventilators to New York City.  They looked at their circumstances and concluded that they could spare those at the point of the need. And because of the low and steady numbers in Washington State and in California, Governor Inslee today announced that they were sending 400 ventilators back to the Strategic National Stockpile.  And those will be deployed at the point of the need.
You know, not only are California and Washington State low and steady but, frankly, as I talked to governors and mayors today, I want to say to the American people that we — we are beginning to see the glimmers of progress.  The experts will tell me not to jump to any conclusions, and I’m not.  But like your President, I’m an optimistic person and I’m hopeful.
And the truth is, we’re starting to see cases and, most importantly, losses and hospitalizations begin to stabilize.  But make no mistake about it: I want to say to the American people, if that holds, if that’s happening, it’s because of what all of you are doing.  It’s because the American people are putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America.  You’re listening to your state and local officials.  You’re practicing social distancing.  You’re using drive-throughs instead of going into restaurants.
And so on behalf of your President and all of us who are working, really, at every level, I just want to say: Thank you, America.  Thank you for responding.  Thank you for putting other people’s lives in the forefront of your thinking, and putting it, again, over and above your own inconvenience and difficulty.
Because of your efforts, there is, as the President just said, light at the end of the tunnel.  And I’m absolutely convinced: With the continued cooperation, patience, persistence, and prayers of the American people, we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this a lot sooner than we first thought it would take.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-20/

April 4, 2020
4:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a busy time.  Very busy time.  And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country.  We’re fighting for you and we’re enduring all of this together.  And we will soon prevail together.  We’re making a lot of progress.
We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states.  The relationships have been, really, very good.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo.  We’re working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible.
We — as you know, we took care of the hospital, including personnel — the 2,500 beds that we build just recently at Javits, including personnel.  And we opened it up to COVID, and that’s something that we also did in Louisiana, and we’re doing it in Dallas.
So we have a lot of not only hospitals being built, but now we’re manning the hospitals because states are, in many cases, unable to get additional people to work.  It’s — it’s just an incredible situation.  There’s never been anything like this.
One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available.  And we’ve got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world, and everybody will tell you that, and we’re dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151 — still, 151 nations are going through it.
We’re working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they’re needed, and in some cases, we’re telling governors we can’t go there because we don’t think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.  And pretty much, so far, we’ve been right about that.  And we’ll continue to do it.
As it really gets — this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week.  And there’ll be a lot of death, unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn’t done.  But there will be death.
We’re looking for an obvious focus in the hardest-hit regions.  Some of them are obvious and some aren’t so obvious.  They spring up.  They come and they — they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn’t at all bothered.  You look at what’s going on in New Jersey — the governor is doing an excellent job, by the way — but how that sprang up.
Every decision that we’re making is made to save lives.  It’s really our sole consideration.  We want to save lives.  We want as few lives lost as possible.  It’s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public.  It’s just incredible.  I could name them, but it’s the same ones.  Always the same ones.  I guess they’re looking for ratings.  I don’t know what they’re looking for.  So bad for our country and so bad — the people understand it.  You look at the levels and approval ratings, and they’re the lowest they’ve ever been for media.  It’s so bad for — for our country.  So bad for the world.  You ought to put it together for a little while, get this over with, and then go back to your fake news.
During a national emergency, it’s just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science.  Many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hotspots — you know what they are — are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs.  And at the current time, they’re really thrilled to be where they are.  Whenever local shortages are reported, we’re asking states to immediately meet the demand.  And we’re stockpiling large amounts in different areas — in different areas.  And we’re going to be discussing that in a little while.
But we want distributions to be made on a fair basis.  We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country.  But no matter where we’re — we’ve been there and we’ve been there very strongly.  I want to thank FEMA.  I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.  I want to thank our military for what they’re doing.
And we’re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states — thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors.  And it’ll be a large number.  It’ll be — we’ll be telling them over the next very short period where they’re going.  And they’re going into war.  They’re going into a battle that they’ve never really trained for.  Nobody has trained for this; nobody has seen this, I would say, since 1917, which was the greatest of them all.  The greatest of this type of battle.  Probably the greatest of them all. Right?  1917.  Up to 100 million people were killed.
In addition, we’re working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized.  And that need changes.  One day it’s one state or one locale, one city.  And then all of a sudden, they’re starting to do well.  We had some very good reports coming out of the State of Washington, coming out of various parts of California — so, areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard.  We can now go to other areas.
It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard.  And Louisiana is just amazing the way it just sprang up.  And everyone is doing a good job but they’re going to be hit hard.
Areas in the country that are not experiencing large-scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require.  And we talk to them and we tell them and we explain it, and for the most part they’re good with it.  We think we’re right.
It’s very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests.  We have some states and areas where they’re just asking for far more.  I mean, look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators.  Forty thousand.  Think of it: 40,000.  It’s not possible.  They won’t need that many, and now they’re admitting they don’t need that many.  But we’re getting as many as we can to them.
Again, nobody has ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits.  But it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need, and it could intentionally and, you know — look, they — everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they’re 100 percent.  And sometimes, when they know they don’t need it, they want it anyway.  It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can’t do that.  It’s not even possible to think about it.
And that’s why — and we’re a backup.  Remember, we’re a backup.  We’re the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into the hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business, where you see we built many hospitals — numerous hospitals in some states — and medical centers.
That’s why my administration has been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the states and hospitals to meet their needs, because we want to be ready when — when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly; you see it.  You see it as sure as you can see it.  And when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it.  We don’t want to have spent everything in one area, and they don’t need it there to anywhere near the extent.
So let me be extremely clear about one point: We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens.  We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we’ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with.  We want to finish this war.  We have to get back to work.  We have to get — we have to open our country again.  We have to open our country again.  We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months.  We’re going to open our country again.  This country wasn’t meant for this.  Few were.  Few were.  But we have to open our country again.
I just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say, virtually all of the sports leagues: Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball; Roger Goodell Commissioner of the National Football League; Adam Silver Commissioner of the National Basketball Association; Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League; Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour; Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women’s National Basketball Association; Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship; Vince McMahon President of the WWE; Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer; Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR; Michael Whan, Commissioner of the LPGA; Roger Penske, Founder and Chairman Penske Corp.; and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders’ Cup.
And there were a couple of others on, and these are all the great leaders of sport.  And they want to get back.  They got to get back.  They can’t do this.  Their sports weren’t designed for it.  The whole concept of our nation wasn’t designed for it.  We’re going to have to get back.  We want to get back soon — very soon.
For example — and I have to say, we’re using the Defense Production Act very powerfully.  In some cas- — times directly; in many cases, indirectly.  Just the threat of it is usually enough.
But FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million — think of that — 180 million.  Who ever heard of 180 million N95 masks?  And we’re working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country.  And I think it’s going to be okay.  We’re going to soon let you know.  But we need the masks.  We don’t want other people getting it, and that’s why we’re — that’s why we’re instituting a lot of Defense Production Act, you could call it, retaliations because that’s what it is; it’s a retaliation.
If people don’t — if people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough, and we’ve been very tough.  Usually we don’t have to use it, but we’ve used it plenty.  It’s turning out more and more, unfortunately.  And it works very well.
Our Supply Chain Logistics Task Force, led by Admiral John Polowczyk, who’s doing a fantastic job, will ensure they’re distributed to the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements.  That’s the 60 million masks that we’re talking about and the hundred and — 180 million N95 masks.  A hundred and eighty million.  Who ever heard of 180 million masks?
And this is a incredible thing.  A lot of times — and we have to stop playing this game — if a governor wants 200 ventilators, and I say, “No, we’re going to send you 1,000.  We think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh, you got more.  Well, it’s not enough.  The President should have sent more.”  So he’s asking for 200.  We give him 1,000.  They say, “How’s the President doing?”  “He should have given more.”  Because that’s politics.  That’s politics.  And that’s unfortunate, because we can’t play that game.
And, you know, that’s one party doing it, and the other party is happy.  But they’re all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time.  Many of their cupboards were bare.
With respect to the ventilators, FEMA and HHS continue to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the states.  In order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies, we’ve been asking states to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates, because some states have more ventilators than they need.  They don’t even like to admit it.  They’ll admit it when everything is over, but that’s — it doesn’t help us very much.
This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time.  FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours.  They will have a whole different set of criteria.  Every day, it’s different criteria.  Every day, this horrible, invisible enemy changes a course.  It changes course.
If you were fighting the normal fight, you’d know what’s happening.  Here is: They hit one, they hit another, they hit another state.  They hit areas that you didn’t expect.  But we’re watching it and we’re capturing it.
Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real-time local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage.  So we have to be able to do that.  And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they’re not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones.  We have now 10,000 in our pipeline, and stockpiled 10,000 — close.
And we’re moving some into New York, so we’re going to need some additional.  We’re moving some into New York City and state, separately.  And we’re bringing them to the point where they’ll need them.
I can also report that, at my direction, 1,000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they’re needed the most.  That’s the hottest of all the hotspots.  New Jersey is right there.  It’s right next to it.  And I don’t know if that’s overflow, but New Jersey is — it’s a great state and it’s a very — it’s a crowded state also, where you have people on top of people.  It’s always tough.  But we’re bringing some of the ventilators.  We got some for New Jersey just yesterday, and we’re going to bring them some more, including doctors.
We’re getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists, and other support workers.  These are from the military.  We’re taking people now out of our military.  We’ve been doing it, but now we’re doing it on a larger basis.  And I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper, who will detail some of what we’re doing, tomorrow and Monday.
As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we’re returning a 300-bed federal medical station to a different location — so where we need it.  And we appreciate that.  They won’t be needing it, and we appreciate them letting us know.  We’re going to move it to a different location.  It was already built.
Many governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines.  They really have.
I’m also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending — they’re spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well, and they’re also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate.
And I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he’s doing every day, dealing with our nation’s governors.  Mike Pence has been working day and night on this, and we want to get it over.  He’s got to get a little more sleep than he’s getting.  He hasn’t been getting very much, I will tell you that.
And we’re all in this together, and it’s a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another.  They really are.
In addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation.  I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Boozman.  You know Senator Boozman; we all do.  He’s a great senator.  He’s a great person.  We spoke just this morning, and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors, and distributors in our nation’s prayers.  And I want to thank the senator for the incredible job he’s been doing.  And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone — everybody is working very hard.
My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection.  Working on a lot of things.  We must utilize our nation’s scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus.  We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can, because we have a lot of things happening in this country, and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work.
This week, the FDA established the Coronavirus Treatment Accelerator Program, which is expediting the development of new anti- — antiviral and other therapies, and they’re doing it on a very rapid basis.  And I think we’re having some very good results.  We’ll tell you about that.
HHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness.  And as you know, last Saturday, the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine.  And the hydroxychloroquine is a — I hope it’s going to be a very important answer.  We’re having some very good things happening with it, and we’re going to be distributing it through the Strategic National Stockpile.  It’s going into the Strategic National Stockpile to treat certain patients.  And we have millions and millions of doses of it; 29 million to be exact.
In addition to that, we’re making it and we’re also getting it from various other locations and countries.  In one case, I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning.  They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine — very large amounts, frankly.  And I said — they had a hold, because, you know, they have 1.5. billion people, and they think a lot of it.  And I said I’d appreciate it if they would release the amounts that we ordered.  And they are giving it serious consideration.  But they do make — India makes a lot of it.
But we have already 29 million.  If you look — I mean, that’s a big number.  Twenty-nine million doses.  And we’ve got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here, and it will be arriving.
We’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data.  But I’ll just speak for myself: It’s been out for a long time.  It’s a malaria drug.  It’s also a drug for lupus.  And there’s a — there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus.  They’re not — they’re not affected so much by it.  Now, maybe that’s correct; maybe it’s false.  You’re going to have to check it out.
But there’s a lot of very positive things happening with that.  That’s a game changer if that’s the case.  Obviously, we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months.  We’re doing great on the vaccines.  I think Johnson & Johnson is leading — seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we’ll see what happens.  But I feel good about that, but that’s down the road.
But tremendous promise with — with what’s just been mentioned.  In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that’s down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug remdesivir.  Now, it’s approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty — pretty good study.  Other drugs are also being studied in patients.
And this week, Oracle, a great company, donated a new web portal — Larry Ellison, amazing guy — and platform to the government to gather real-time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments.  And they have a very sophisticated site, we’ll be learning a lot from Oracle.  And thank you to them.
We’re also spending economic dollars like you wouldn’t believe, and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses.  Yesterday, the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers.  In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration, and over 1,200 lending partners, processed over 28,000 loans — it’s, so far, ahead of schedule — and billions and billions of dollars.
It’s worked out incredibly well, and I want to thank Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and a lot of the big banks that have been involved, and a lot of the community banks.  Community banks have really jumped on it.  And it’s, so far, going way ahead of schedule.
The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program — that’s great — as well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you’re familiar with, on the same terms as every other applicant.
If we run out of funding for the employee retention program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money.  This is money that’s really going directly to the people that need it — the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it.
Finally, I can — because when we open, we want to open strong, with businesses that are going.  Remember, we had the greatest economy in the world, and then one day, we were told we got to shut it down, stop it, tell everyone to stay home, because of this horrible virus.  And we did that, and we did the right thing.  But now we have to open.  We have to open our country.
Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries.  Many of those countries were terrific in helping us, and I appreciate that very much.
Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know.  And once I did, they snapped, like you wouldn’t believe.  They really helped us great.  So I appreciate that.  So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries, with no chance of getting out, and we got them back.  Four hundred flights, seventy-five countries.   Think of that.  And those countries, in almost every instance, had a big problem with the virus.
I want to thank the American people, most of all, for the selfless sacrifices that they’re making for our nation.  I know it’s not pleasant, although some people have said they’ve gotten to know their family better, and they love their family more than ever, and that’s a beautiful thing.  They’ve actually gotten to know them.  They’re in the same house with their family for a long time.  I guess it can also work the other way, perhaps, but we don’t want to talk about that.
And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread.  Sustaining this war effort is — and that’s what it is; this is a war effort — is the patriotic duty of every citizen.  While we may be more physically distant for a time, we’re closer together in the heart and in the spirit.
And through this, great national unity is happening.  We’re having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn’t think would be possible to develop like this.
And we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might.  We’re doing really well, and I’m very proud of everybody out there.  We’re very proud of you.  It’s something that nobody could have ever projected.  It’s been over 100 years that a thing like this has happened.
And the problem with this one is the contagion.  It’s so contagious.  Nobody has ever seen anything like that where it’s so contagious.  You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it.  You can catch it.  You know how long it can live on surfaces.  So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion.
So, we’re getting there.  We’re going to make sure that it’s over soon.  And just keep going.  It’s not going to be long.
And thank you very much.  And with that, I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak.  And he’s been doing yeoman’s work at the FDA.
Thank you very much.  Doctor, thank you.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m going to speak about hydroxychloroquine and the efforts around that.  Just to preface, I’d like to echo what the President said about the American people and the resiliency and the just terrific work.  Mitigation is such an important part of our fight against the COVID-19 virus.
Last week, as the President said, we issued an emergency use authorization to allow the donated hydroxychloroquine to come into the country and enter the general circulation.  We are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials, and also into general use for physicians, because as you know, physicians, based upon their interaction with the patients, their assessment of the risks and benefits can write a prescription for hydroxychloroquine if they think it’s appropriate for the patient.  Being a physician, we do this all the time.  And that assessment needs to be done between a patient and a doctor.
And then the third portion is we wanted to make sure that these drugs were in the circulation — in the supply chain, so that people who have them or need them for the other indications — lupus, rheumatoid arthritis — had them available.  So that was the purpose of the emergency use authorization.
One other thing I’d like to mention is that we, on Friday, stood up a formal convalescent plasma program.  We have a great deal of enthusiasm for that.  There are some reports that this is a benefit to patients in other countries who have had the COVID-19 virus.
And what this means is taking plasma from patients who have had the virus and who have recovered, and transferring the immunity — the immunoglobulins, if you will — the immunity from that person to someone who’s sick.  And we’re hopefully expanding that across the country.  The Red Cross is involved in that program.  And I think it shows a great promise.  It needs to be studied like other things.  But just like I said before, it provides hope.  We don’t want to provide false hope, but definitely hope.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Tony, please.
MR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I’d like to just take a couple of moments to talk a little bit about the public health aspects and how it relates to what the President just said about the need for us to begin to at least think about returning to some degree of normality.  And that has to do with what’s going to be happening as we end this week and we go into next week.
You will be seeing — and we should not be surprised because the kinetics of how this virus works — is that we’re going to be seeing that there are going to be deaths that are going to continue to go up.  But as I mentioned to this group and to the general public multiple times, there really is a cascading of events where you have new cases, hospitalizations, intensive care, and deaths.  So at the same time that we may be seeing an increase in deaths, we want to focus on the effective mitigation is really the number of new cases.  And that’s what we’re going to be thinking about and looking about.
So we’re going to pay close attention to that, and hopefully the kinds of mitigations that we’re talking about are going to have the impact to allow us to begin to think about maybe changing a bit.
So the question arises is: Is the mitigation working?  So let’s look historically and then just look at the reality of it.  Clearly, in the countries — China included — that have implemented very strict kinds of programs of mitigation, clearly it works.  In our own country, we’ve seen indication of that in Washington.  Remember, Washington State was the first to get hit.  But they put in a really good program of mitigation.  And if you look at the charts that Dr. Birx showed the other day, they’re still down, they’re doing well.
And the reason is — again, what I’ve said before, but I think it’s worth reiterating — that we have two opposing forces here: the virus, which wants to do what the virus wants to do.  Viruses transmit from people to people.  When people are separated from each other, virus does not transmit; it doesn’t go anywhere.  And that’s the reason why something as simple as the physical separation — because if you look at the Vice President’s chart that he shows all the time here from this podium, every aspect of that, ending the COVID outbreak in 30 days, has some aspect of it, a physical separation — whether that’s avoiding crowds, whether that staying six feet away from people, whether that’s doing teleworking.  All of it does that.  That’s our most important tool.  We’ll be talking about vaccines and drugs and things like that that will mitigate later.  But this is what we really have to do.
And I want to — I want to actually just plea, as I do multiple times from here, to the American public: You know, as sobering and as difficult as this is, what we are doing is making a difference.  So we really need to continue to do that.
I must tell you, I was just mentioning to the Vice President as we came in: Last night, when I wasn’t here, I went out with my wife and actually did a little powerwalking down Massachusetts Avenue — for those who live in Washington, know what I’m talking about — and we passed a couple of restaurants where people were getting takeout food.  The restaurants were closed to people going in, but they were open to takeout.
And I saw something that absolutely made me feel really, really good.  They were separating themselves by at least six feet.  In fact, some of the restaurants had little things on the floor that said, “Stand here” and then “Stand there.”
And I think if we as a nation pulled together to do that, hopefully when we keep coming back here at these press conferences, we’ll be able to show you that that curve that we keep talking about is going in the right direction.
And I’d be happy to answer questions later.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Okay, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-19/

5:25 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  I just had a meeting with Kevin McCarthy, future Speaker of the House, I hope.  And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California.  And also, the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you look at the — at the bump.  You take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there.  So I congratulate everybody out there.
But I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words.  So, Kevin, please.
LEADER MCCARTHY:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And I would like to thank you.  On the basis of California, Governor Newsom says the work that you’re doing together has been — you’re working very closely — has been effective in California as well — the Vice President and the President.
You know, today, Mr. President, I want to thank you, especially for the work that Secretary Mnuchin has done, especially for small businesses.  Just today alone, I saw Bank of America had more than 10,000 loans in two hours.
And for anybody who’s in small business — My first small business was when I was 20 years old.  You don’t have income coming in right now, you get a loan, but for your rent, paying your employees, and paying your utilities is a grant.  That’s part of the CARES Act.  And I think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back, keep them afloat through the next two months, and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus.  So I just want to thank you for all that work.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job you’re doing.
LEADER MCCARTHY:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  You go ahead.  I’ll talk to you later.
Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America.  That seems to be the hotspot right now.  But you have some others, as you know, that are very — very bad.  Very bad.  Louisiana is getting hit very hard.  Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard.  New Jersey is — is –surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought.  They’re doing a really good job.  The governor is doing a really good job out there.
New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure.  They’re the best in the world.  We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial, medical, scientific.  We will not spare anything.  We’ll get it back into shape.
The Empire State — the governor is doing an excellent job.  They’re all working very hard together.  At the request of the governor, as you know, the Javits Center, we have 2,500 beds, and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after, the patients can be looked after.  That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents.  And, you know, it’s very interesting, the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving.
So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility.  The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.
And today, also, the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus.  From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.  So you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred.
In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure.  So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it.  They suggested for a period of time.  But this is voluntary.  I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.
But you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.  Probably material that you’d have at home.  These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.
I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job.  Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services.
The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time.  Again, we’re going to all come back together here.  We’re going to all come back together.  And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.
A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.  Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.  One of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.  And said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.  So maybe it’ll stay.  Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.  But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.
So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing.  You can do it.  You don’t have to do it.  I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.  It may be good.  Probably will.  They’re making a recommendation.  It’s only a recommendation.  It’s voluntary.
We’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.  The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays — which is really something; that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.  Those are great companies, and they’re all doing the same thing.  So, co-pays.  For them to do that is — it’s a big statement.  We appreciate it.
Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.  So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.  This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.  So that’s, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.
I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.
The security and Secretary — the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.  We need these items immediately for domestic use.  We have to have them.  But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items, and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.
We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.  Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles — many, many, many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.  All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.  Most of it has already been given out.  And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.
In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.  Department of Defense.  And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City.  Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.  And they were very grateful.  8.1 million.  And we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.  That’s a lot of N95 respirators.
Today, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans.  They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them.
The CEO of Ochsner, Warner Thomas — who’s really been fantastic, I have to say — indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns.  And I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow.  So they’ll have the 230,000.  That’s Louisiana — New Orleans.  Two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns; they’ll have them by tomorrow.
We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military.  And we are in a war.  The invisible enemy — remember.
Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits, where we take it over.  And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the New York area.  So we’re going to have it manned by the military — Javits Center.
National Guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies.  That includes National Guard.  The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies.  So I’ve given approval to use the National Guards — the various National Guards in the different states.  And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material.
The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states: in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington Wisconsin, Ohio.  They’re doing a lot of work in just those states, plus additionals, that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow.  But they’re doing some job.  The Army Corps of Engineers — what a job they’re doing.  And FEMA — what a job they’re doing.
As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers.  We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus.  And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings.  Hydroxychloroquine — I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results.  I hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing.
But we have it right now in — approximately now, it’s increased to 1,500 people.  I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York — terrific guy, by the way.  He’s — we’re doing a good job.  And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it.  So it’s been there for about three and a half days, but I think — and many other places it’s being tested too.  And we have a tremendous supply of it.  We’ve ordered it in the case that it works.  And it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts.  And we’ll see what happens.
My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses.  On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5. billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time.
And Bank of America has been incredible.  Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks.  And we’re already at $3.5 billion going out to incredible people.  But that’s way ahead of schedule.
The SBA and the Treasury are working around the clock, and our banking partners are really incredible.  And they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible, and then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go, and now they’ll keep them.  And that’s good.  And then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees.  And we’ll try and get back to where we were.  Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.
The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis.  This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.  I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time.
There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus.  The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil.  So we’re working with our great energy companies.  These are great companies.  They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  And they’ve kept America really going for a long time.  And no big price hikes, no big anything.  I mean, they’ve just kept it going.  And now they got hit.  But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.
America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.  Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.  And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.  So stay at home.  This is ending.  This will end.  You’ll see some bad things and then you’re going to see some really good things.  And it’s not going to be too long.
We will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus.
And with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up, Vice President, and say a few words.  And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.
And it’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C., and our country is a great place, and we’re getting better.  We’re getting better very quickly.
This was artificially induced.  We just said — they said, “Close it down.  You have to close it down.”  We closed it down and we’re healing.  We’re going to get it better fast.
So, Mike, if you could come up say a few words.  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The President just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
In addition, some good news Dr. Deborah Birx will reflect on in a moment.  And some of the areas across America where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts — the American people putting into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines — are having a positive effect.
In fact, today, California and Washington State, where the coronavirus first emerged in our country, remain — the cases remain at a steady but low rate.  And we know, as Governor Newsom said yesterday, that they’re not out of the woods yet.  We continue to flow resources.
But we want to commend people in those states and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measures that state and local leaders are advising and that — and that the President has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for America.
We’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in New York State, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, and Boston.  And as the President indicated, we’re prioritizing resources to support healthcare workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities.
On the subject of testing, now more than 1.4 million tests have been performed across the country.  And as you all are aware, some 266,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus.
Abbott instruments, which now can perform a 15-minute test across the country, have literally 18,000 of their machines across the nation today.  But at the President’s direction, FEMA is acquiring over 1,200 more machines to distribute to every state public health lab in America and also to our Indian Healthcare Service.
And the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA — once again, in near record time — has approved an antibody test developed by Cellex.  And we’re continuing on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests and these innovative new tests not just to meet this moment, but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead.
As the President mentioned, he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation.
We also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailers.  On the President’s behalf, we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for America.  It’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries.  But I heard — I heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associates and their customers first.  And it was deeply inspiring.
On the subject of supplies, the President detailed our work in that space.  It continues to this day.  As part of our air bridge, we had a flight arrive from China today to Columbus, Ohio.  We continue to work each and every day, watching the data about cases, to ensure that, in particular, not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the frontlines, but also that ventilators are available as the — as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities.  We are literally working hour by hour, day by day to make sure that patients, families, and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need.
As the President mentioned, we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the Paycheck Protection Program today.
We have available for questions the head of the CDC today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings.
And Secretary Azar, in a few moments, will explain just how the President’s decision to make sure that no American will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment.
I’m pleased to report, at the President’s direction, Medicaid and Medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on.
And of course, the President just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving co-pays on testing, but they’re now waiving co-pays for at least 60 days on any coronavirus treatment.
But now, as Secretary Azar will enumerate, now we’ll make sure that any American, even those that have no insurance, will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill.
I’ll just give a general reminder to every American: There is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America.  Every American has a role to play.  And I want to thank you on behalf of the President and all of the American people for the way that you’re stepping forward, you’re engaging in the social distancing, and doing the things that will slow the spread.
We encourage you to keep on keeping on.  And we will get through this, America.  We will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the President always describes.  But we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you Mr. Vice President, Mr. President.  Thank you for your words of discipline and determination.  I guess that really describes what we’re asking every American to really be: disciplined about these guidelines and really determined to stay in that space of execution.
You know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure.  We really do appreciate the work of the citizens of California and Washington State, because we do see that their curve is different.  Their curve is different from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  And we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers.
We also are deeply grateful, despite the way their curve looks today, they continue to get ready for a different potential, so that they can ensure that patients, if they do get sick, have options and availability.
To all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have referred to as “hot zones” — areas where the number of cases are quite significant — the New Orleans; the New York City metro area, including New Jersey and Connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers are providing.  We’re really working now at a much more granular level, talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments.
And to work — I think we discussed it yesterday, but I think it was quite clear also — and reiterated by Governor Cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas, and other areas, move through their peak of new infections.
When we talked about it at the beginning of this week, we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult.  And we want to recognize the number of Americans who have lost their lives to this virus, and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care, but I think I’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital.
We continue to watch, in addition, the Chicago area, the Detroit area, and have some developing concerns around Colorado, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania.  So as you can see, each of these will follow their own curves.  We’ll be getting more and more of those case, over time, information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states, counties, and communities move through this together in solidarity, and really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every American who needs our support right now.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus.  First, I want to thank all of the members of the HHS team and the frontline healthcare workers across America, including those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals, at our healthcare facilities, those who clean, those who deliver, those who stock the shelves — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus.  Your country has asked you to serve as never before, and you have responded heroically.
I’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured.  Getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for President Trump.  We are already rolling out the $1 billion in funding from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to cover providers’ expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured.
The CARES Act, signed by the President, includes another $100 billion for healthcare providers.  Under the President’s direction, we will use a portion of that funding to cover providers’ costs of delivering COVID-19 care for the uninsured, sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing.
As a condition of receiving funds under this program, providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care.  Providers will be reimbursed at Medicare rates.
We will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the $100 billion will go to providers.  We’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast, fair, simple, and transparent.
I’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage, you have insurance options that you should look into.  You’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges, and depending on your state, you may be eligible for Medicaid.
Just as President Trump is working to ensure that COVID-19 treatment is paid for, he’s working to support new treatment options for patients.  Thanks to the President’s leadership, many providers are trying different experimental therapies, and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working.
Today, Oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowd-sourced, real-time information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics.  While this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials, it gives us data rapidly.  If you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us, you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work.  There’s a special registration page for providers at COVID19.Oracle.com.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Okay, let’s go.  Steve?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-18/

April 2, 2020
5:22 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Good to be with you all.  We’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus.  It’s vital that every American follows our guidelines on the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”  The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved.  We’re going to save a lot of American lives.  And we’re in control of our own fate very much so.  Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene, and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger.
While you’re fighting this battle from home, we’re working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world.  We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus, as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine.  And we’re making a lot of progress.  I think, medically, a lot of progress.
At the same time, we’re also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know.  I want to remind small-business owners across America that the Paycheck Protection Program is launching tomorrow.  Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses, including sole proprietors.  These loans are up to 100 percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers.  Got to take care of your workers.
Furthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens.  The Treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts.  And don’t forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare, and your Medicaid.  We’re protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and I always will.
I’d like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, who’s doing a fantastic job — she’s going to be very busy in the next little while — and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives.  And then we’ll get on to the attack of the virus itself.
And please, if I might, Steve and Jovita.
ADMINISTRATOR CARRANZA:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, Secretary Mnuchin, Ivanka Trump, and all who I have been working closely with in this effort.  Small Business is the backbone of the American economy, and the President has put the nation’s 30 million small businesses front and center in the response effort, and we are working hard to get money to them quickly.
This is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses, and we know that there will be challenges in the process.  Secretary Mnuchin and I are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented.
The private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first.  This administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business, you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country.  And your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees.
At SBA, we are working around the clock to support small businesses, ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation.
This relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their day-to-day operating expenses.
Today I want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the Paycheck Protection Program and how they can benefit from this.  Simply put, the Paycheck Protection Program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open.  SBA will forgive the portion of the loan that is used toward job retention and certain other expenses.  We are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders.
The Paycheck Protection Program is in addition to substantial work that the SBA has and will continue to do to help small businesses, including providing advances on SBA disaster loans and forgiving existing SBA loan payments over the next six months.
Additional details on these critically important programs can be found at SBA.gov.  And we will be updating these resources regularly.
Our hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus.  Our communities around the country are stepping up, and we will get through this together.
At SBA, we know that every phone call, email, or application submitted has a small-business owner, their employees, and the communities they support around the other side.  Our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption.
I want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit.  We will continue working around the clock, as we’ve done, with our federal and private sector partners, expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Jovita.  Very good.  Thank you.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Jovita.  Mr. President, you’ve made it clear to us we now need to execute.  We need to get money to small business and American workers, and that’s what we’re doing.
The SBA and Treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow.  And when Jovita says people are working around the clock, they literally — we had both teams working until 4 o’clock in the morning and start working again today.
We’ve heard feedback from lenders, community banks, regional banks, and we spent the last 24 hours making this system even easier.
So this will be up and running tomorrow.  I encourage all small businesses that have 500 or fewer people, please contact your lenders.  Any FDIC institution will be able to do this; any credit union, existing SBA lenders, and fintech lenders.
You get the money.  You’ll get it the same day.  You use this to pay your workers.  Please bring your workers back to work.  If you’ve let them go, you have eight weeks, plus overhead.  This is a very important program.
I’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans — and again, the interest rate is paid for as part of the program; the borrower doesn’t have to pay this — to 1 percent.  We had announced it was going to be 50 basis points.  We’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs — even though the government is borrowing at three or four basis points — this is, on average, a 90-day loan.  To make this attractive for community banks, we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate.
Again, I encourage everybody: Take out the Paycheck Protection Program.
I’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments.  I had previously said this would take us three weeks.  I’m pleased to report that, within two weeks, the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayers’ account.
And as the President said last night, the President authorized me to say that anybody that has Social Security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return, and we’ll have that.  If we don’t have your direct deposit information, we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up.  It is a very large priority.  The President has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands.
I’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve.  We’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the “Main Street” lending facility.  We’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well.
And I’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit — it’s up and running.  The first $10,000 of wages, you get a 50 percent credit; that’s $5,000 per person.  For everyone who’s kept someone, you can immediately get that money; you can deduct it from what you owe the IRS immediately.  If you don’t owe us money, you’ll get a refundable tax credit.  So that is up and running.
I’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running.  We’re taking applications from the airlines, from the cargo companies, and from national security companies.

5:35 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you.  So, America continues to wage all-out war to defeat the virus — this horrible, horrible virus.  You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday.  And we explained why we’re extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread by 30 days.
Together, we have the power to save countless lives.  We’re attacking the virus on every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation, and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people.  And we did that early — far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.
In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory.  As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there’s a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain.  And we must not let that happen.  We will never let that happen.
Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics.  We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives.
In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption, and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace.  We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft, and helicopters; Coast Guard cutters; and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region.  Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment, and we’ve taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy.
Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien will provide more details.  In addition, I’m going to have General Milley, who has done an incredible job in so many ways, say a few words.  And also with us: our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know — I think you know; and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz.
So I’m going to ask Mark to start and then we can go.  And after that, we’re going to take questions as it pertains to this.  And then we’ll go onto phase two, which is the virus itself.  Okay?
Thank you, please.  Mark.
SECRETARY ESPER:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon, everyone.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here today as we make this very important announcement.  At a time when the nation and the Department of Defense are focused on protecting the American people from the spread of the coronavirus, we also remain vigilant to the many other threats our country faces.
Today, at the President’s direction, the Department of Defense, in close cooperation with our interagency partners, began enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.  This initiative is part of the administration’s whole-of-government approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and protecting the American people from their scourge.
I want to thank all of our partners in this effort, to include the United States Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice, and members of the intelligence community for their tremendous support and cooperation.
To conduct these enhanced operations, the President has directed the deployment of additional ships, aircraft, and security forces to the United States Southern Command Area of Responsibility.  Included in this force package are Navy destroyers and littoral combat ships, Coast Guard cutters, P-8 patrol aircraft, and elements of an Army Security Force Assistance Brigade.  These additional forces will nearly double our capacity to conduct counter-narcotics operations in the region.
Additionally, 22 partner nations have joined us in this fight, bringing with them a variety of intelligence and operations capabilities needed to defeat these criminal organizations.
Last year alone, United States Southern Command’s operations resulted in the seizure of over 280 metric tons of drugs, much of which was designated for shipment to America.
While this was an incredible achievement, there’s much more work to be done.  Transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten our security by smuggling cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamines, and other narcotics across our borders.  These drug traffickers put our communities — communities at risk and destroy lives.  Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdose and thousands more suffer the harmful effects of addiction.
Furthermore, corrupt actors, like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, rely on the profits derived from the sale of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power.  The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro’s criminal control over the country.
Drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness by increasing their illicit activities.  We must do more to prevent these drugs from arriving at our shores.  These enhanced counter-narcotics operations that are now underway will further disrupt the flow of illicit drugs to America, deny our adversaries the financial resources they depend on, and build the capacity of our partner nations throughout the region.
I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and support to this critical mission.  This is a particularly important time for this operation to begin, as nations around the world shift their focus inward to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, many criminal organizations are attempting to capitalize on this crisis.  The enhanced operations we’re announcing today will keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect the American people from the devastation caused by the flow of illegal drugs into our country.
Mr.  President, thank you for your leadership as we begin this important operation.  While the men and women of the United States military work hard here at home to fight the coronavirus, we continue to take action around the world to defend our great country.
Thank you and I’d like to invite General Milley.
GENERAL MILLEY:  Thank you, Secretary, for those words.  And thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  And I want to publicly thank Admiral Craig Faller, the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command out of Miami, for leading this operation, which is underway effective today; and also Admiral Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, and Admiral Schultz for their contributions to this from their services.  There’s thousands of sailors, Coast Guardsmen, soldiers, airmen, Marines involved in this operation.
We came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels, as a result of COVID-19, were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country.  As we know, 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs.  That’s unacceptable.  We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists, and we are at war with the drug cartels as well.
This is the United States military.  You will not penetrate this country.  You will not get past Jump Street.  You’re not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.  And we will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans.
So, right now, the Navy has marshalled additional grey-hull ships from both PACOM and EUCOM and for the naval fleet at Norfolk.  And they are set sail already and they are in the Caribbean right now.  In addition to that, there’s 10 Coast Guard cutters and there’s Special Operations Forces and Security Force Assistance Brigades, along with Air Force reconnaissance aircraft.
The bottom line is: You’re not going to get through.  Now is not the time to try to penetrate the United States with illegal drugs to kill Americans.  We’re the United States military and we will defend our country, regardless of the cost.
Thank you, Mr.  President.  Thank you, Secretary.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, General.  Beautiful.  Thank you.
Bill.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:  Thank you, Mr.  President, and thanks for your decisive leadership as we confront this unprecedented challenge posed by corona- — coronavirus.  I’d like to thank you for your support for this important initiative and thank all of — the Secretary of Defense and all the services for taking on this — this important initiative.
Obviously, during this crisis, we’re all focused above all else on COVID-19.  But at the same time, our law enforcement and national security work must go forward, protecting the American people from the full array of threats.
For the Department of Justice, one of our highest priorities must remain destroying the Mexican cartels.  Their trafficking is largely responsible for the deaths, as we all know now, of 70,000 Americans a year.  And also the costs of this don’t count the destroyed families, the destroyed lives, the draining of our national treasure as state budgets are crushed by the burden that this — this narcotic trafficking causes.
The President has made clear that we are in this fight against the cartels to win, and that we are not interested in half measures, and that the threat posed by the cartel is not just a law enforcement threat, but a national security threat as well.
And, in December, building on your success with the Mexican President in forging a cooperative relationship in the area of immigration, you asked me to go down and meet with the President López Obrador and our Mexican counterparts to see if we could also establish a more comprehensive and coordinated effort with the Mexicans in confronting the cartels.  And we’ve had some successful visits and discussions, and currently have an array of activities underway against the cartels.  And we anticipate, along with the Mexicans, that these are going to bear fruit in the months ahead.
But it quickly became clear that we can obtain the most immediate results, the best bang for the buck, where we increase the assets involved in interdiction on both the Pacific and Atlantic side of Mexico in the Central American countries.  For years, the cartels have been using these sea routes to take the cocaine up from, principally, Colombia — now also out of Venezuela.  And these sea routes on both coasts have become the primary means of bringing cocaine up to the United States.
Because of the superb work done by the Defense Department and our intelligence community, we know exactly, most of the time, where these traffickers are at sea.  But we’re significantly — have been up until now significantly limited in our ability to interdict because of the numbers of the assets we have deployed.
Prior today, this limitation meant we could only intercept a fraction of the traffickers that — and the various boats that were detected.  This will now double our capacity, and we are talking about hundreds of tons of cocaine now — we’re now in a position to seize.
So this is going to radically improve our interdiction efforts and put tremendous pressure, we think, on the cartels.  And the effort that SOUTHCOM is undertaking is going to save lives by taking drugs off the street.
Last week, I announced the unsealing of charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and other crimes against the former Maduro regime — 16 members of that regime — and their involvement in trafficking of 250 metric tons a year.  A lot of that comes by sea, as I discussed at that time.
But also, because of the pressure we’re applying by our sea interdiction, they are trying to establish an air route out of Venezuela, up into Central America, which is one of the reasons we’re trying to move firmly against that corrupt regime.
You know, this drug war has gone on for many decades.  And at times in the past, we’ve had great success and great results.  And at times, we’ve taken our eye off the ball — fortunately, not in this administration.  And I’m grateful that you, Mr. President, have brought focus to this fight and the determination to use whatever tools are necessary to win the fight.  The cartels have to be defeated, both for the people of this country and for the people of Mexico and Venezuela.
So I’d like to thank you again, Mr. President, Secretary Esper, for providing the wherewithal required to help win this war against the cartels and others who seek to send illicit drugs into our country.
And, with that, I’d like to introduce Ambassador O’Brien.
AMBASSADOR O’BRIEN:  Thank you, General.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Today’s action is another example of the bold leadership of President Trump and his commitment to protecting the homeland against threats that seek to destabilize the United States and our Western Hemisphere.
The uncontrolled flow of illegal drugs into the United States poisons our communities; fuels the dangerous epidemic — epidemic of addiction; and threatens the safety and security of all Americans.
The impressive U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and interagency operation will address a range of threats to our national security posed by narco-traffickers and narco-terrorists.
It will reduce illicit financial support for the drug traffic- — for drug trafficking that provides the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela and other bad actors with the funds necessary to conduct their malign activities.
Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to execute our maximum pressure policy to counter the Maduro regime’s malign activities, including drug trafficking.  And this operation will help to choke off the funds that go to that corrupt regime.
Maduro, narco-terrorists, and criminals should make no mistake that even as we are working around the clock to fight the spread of coronavirus, we will continue to execute the President’s counter-narcotics strategy.
We’re working on a number of important national security priorities as we face this public health crisis.  The United States will continue to combat disinformation and fake news about this virus.  We will work with the world’s largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets.  We will always protect our servicemen and servicewomen around the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
I want the American people to know that President Trump and Vice President Pence and their administration are working tirelessly every day to protect the health and well-being of Americans and respond to the coronavirus.
Our adversaries should take note however: This President has a clear-eyed focus on America’s national security’s — security interest.  And let me be clear, it would be a mistake — a mistake with terrible consequences — for any adversary to attempt to do us harm during this health crisis — or ever, for that matter.
Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So do we have any questions on this?  Because this group is going to go back to work.  They’re going to leave.
John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-16/

5:30 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Our country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before.  You all see it.  You see it probably better than most.
We’re at war with a deadly virus.  Success in this fight will require the full, absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion.  Very important.
Each of us has the power, through our own choices and actions, to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us.
That’s why we really have to do what we all know is right.  Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices.  Every business is being asked to fulfill its patriotic duty.  Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work, and interact each and every day.
And I wouldn’t be surprised to see this going on long into the future, when this virus is gone and defeated.  Some of the things we’re doing now will be very good practice for the future, including for not getting the flu, which is very devastating also.  So some of what we’re learning now will live on into the future — I really believe that: shaking hands or not shaking hands; washing hands all the time; staying a little apart.
Fifteen days ago, we published our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread of the virus.  On Sunday, I announced that this campaign will be extended until April 30th.
In a few moments, Dr. Birx will explain the data that formed the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines, and Dr. Fauci will explain why it’s absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days.  It’s a matter of life and death, frankly.  It’s a matter of life and death.
I know our citizens will rise to the occasion, and they already have sacrificed a lot.  We had the greatest economy in the history of our country.  We had the greatest economy in the world.  We had the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers that we’ve ever had, by far.  And in one instant, we said we have no choice but to close it up.  Just as Americans have always done, they will do a job like few have seen before.  And they’re proud to do it, and I see that.  There’s a great pride going on right now.
Before we hear from our experts, we have a few other announcements.  Today, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration announced further details on the Paycheck Protection Program, which was made possible by the 2-trillion-dollar relief bill I signed into law last week.  Nearly $350 billion in loans will soon be available through lending partners to help small businesses meet payroll and other expenses for up to two months.  These loans will be forgiven as long as businesses keep paying their workers.  This includes sole proprietors and independent contractors.  Applications will be accepted starting this Friday, April 3rd.  So, on Friday, April 3rd, that’s when it begins.
Earlier today, I spoke with leading Internet and phone providers who are doing a tremendous job of keeping our Internet and lines of communication flowing under very strongly increased strain.  The business is more than anybody has seen before, because everyone is inside.  They’re all making calls.
Among the leaders I spoke to were Hans Vestberg of Verizon Communications, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Mike Sievert of T-Mobile, Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications, Brian Roberts of Comcast, John Malone of Liberty Media, Dexter Goei of Altice, Michel Combes of Sprint, and Aryeh Bourkoff of LionTree.  Also, Pat Esser of Cox Communications and Jeffrey Storey of CenturyLink.  They’re doing an incredible job.
If you look at other continents — if you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did, and much different route.  We were talking about that just a little while ago.  And they’re having tremendous problems.  Other countries are having problems.  Other continents are having problems.
But with business at a level that nobody has seen it before on the Internet, it’s holding up incredibly well, and they expect that to continue no matter what happened and no matter how much more it gains, which, if it can gain more than it already is, I don’t know, because they’re setting records.
Let me also update you on the distribution of urgently needed resources and supplies.  And we have a lot of numbers.  I’m going to let Mike Pence speak to that in a little while.  But we’re giving massive amounts of medical equipment and supplies to the 50 states.  We also are holding back quite a bit.  We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go.  We have to hold them back because the surge is coming, and it’s coming pretty strong.  And we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it.
So, we’re ready to go, and we’ve also distributed — I just spoke with the governor of Michigan.  Had a great conversation.  And we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan.  We’re sending them to Louisiana.  We sent additional ventilators to New York, additional ventilators to New Jersey.
And, I will say, in New York, FEMA is supplying 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs to help respond to the increasing caseload.  That’s a lot of ambulances.
In California, the Army Corps of Engineers is developing eight facilities to expand hospital capacity up to 50,000 beds.  Fifty thousand.  And had a great conversation last night with Gavin Newsom.  He’s doing — he’s doing a really good job.  We — we’re in constant communications.  The USNS Mercy hospital ship is operational.  It’s in Los Angeles and receiving patients.
And, in New York, as you know, the Comfort — everybody watched that — it’s in place and will be, in a very short while, receiving large numbers of patients.  Over a thousand rooms and 12 operating rooms.
FEMA has also provided 100 travel trailers to assist with housing needs.  And we’re ordering hundreds more.
In Michigan, FEMA will soon deliver, in addition to the ventilators, 250-bed field hospital, and Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating locations to build alternate care facilities.  So we’re doing a field hospital, in Michigan, of 250 beds.  And we may be doubling it up soon, depending on the need.  They’re doing a good job with beds in Michigan, but they may need more than the 250.  So, FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers are prepared to go there quickly and get it done.
In Louisiana, we’re delivering two field hospitals to provide 500 new hospital beds.  I’ve been talking with the governor, John Bel Edwards, and the Army Corps of Engineers has been really doing incredible work, establishing 3,000-bed alternate care site at the New Orleans Convention Center, which will be operational, believe it or not, this week.  So we’re doing a 3,000-bed alternate care site, and we’re also doing a 500-bed new hospital.  And that’s in Louisiana, which really got hit.  It started off very late, and it was looking good, and then all of a sudden, it just reared up; it came from nowhere.
In addition to the supplies we’re delivering, we’re also giving hospitals the flexibility to use new facilities, including surgical care centers, to care for hospital patients who are not infected.  For example, I know that many expectant mothers are understandably concerned about exposing their newborn babies to the virus, and they should be.  With our action yesterday, hospitals now have the authority to create special areas for mothers to deliver their babies in a very safe and healthy environment.  Totally separate.
Over the past two months, the U.S. State Department has organized one of the largest and most complex international evacuation operations in American history.  Mike Pompeo has been working round the clock, along with Ambassador O’Brien.  Since January 29th, we have successfully repatriated over 25,000 Americans from more than 50 countries, where they were literally stuck — in some cases, locked in.
And I salute the incredible public servants at the Department of State, as well as their counterparts at DHS and HHS who have played such an important role in doing this.  You probably read about the young people in Peru and young people in Brazil, and they were absolutely stuck, and we got them out.  Got them — almost everybody is out now, back home with their parents, their wives, their husbands.
I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead.  We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks.  And then, hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting, after having studied it so hard, you’re going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel.  But this is going to be a very painful — a very, very painful two weeks.
When you look and see, at night, the kind of death that’s been caused by this invisible enemy, it’s incredible.  I was watching, last night, Governor Murphy of New Jersey say “29 people died today,” meaning yesterday, and others talking about numbers far greater.  But you get to know a state.  I know New Jersey so well, and you hear 29 people.  And hundreds in other locations.  Hundreds in other states.  And this is going to be a rough two-week period.
As a nation, we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that — that really important day when we’re going to see things get better, all of a sudden.  And it’s going to be like a burst of light, I really think and I hope.
Our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve.  This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part.
I appreciate a lot of the media.  We’ve had a lot of really good things said.  I think only good things can be said when you look at the job that’s been done.
I just spoke with Franklin Graham who is an extraordinary person.  And Samaritan’s Purse has been — like so many others — just been amazing and so fast.  They did it so fast.  He’s been doing that for a long time, but I think people are really seeing what they have done.  Franklin Graham — a very special family.
As we send planeloads of masks and gloves and supplies to the communities battling the plague — and that’s what it is; this a plague — we also send our prayers.  We pray for the doctors and the nurses, for the paramedics and the truck drivers, and the police officers and the sanitation workers, and, above all, the people fighting for their lives in New York and all across our land.
I watched as doctors and nurses went into a certain hospital in Elmhurst this morning.  I know Elmhurst, Queens.  That’s — I grew up right next to it.  I know the hospital very well.  And seeing it all my life — my young life.  And I will tell you that to see the scenes of trailers out there and what they’re doing with those trailers — they’re freezers — and nobody can even believe it.
And I spoke to some of my friends; they can’t believe what they’re seeing.  And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning.  It’s like military people going into battle, going into war.  The bravery is incredible.  And I just have to take my hat — I would take my hat — if I were wearing a hat, I’d rip that hat off so fast and I would say you people are just incredible.  They really are. They’re very brave.  They’re going in and they don’t know — you have — you have lots of things flying around in the air.  You don’t know what you’re touching.  Is it safe?
And you also see where you have friends that go into the hospital and you say, “How is he doing?” two days later.  And they say, “Sir, he is unconscious” or “He’s in a coma.”  So things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country.
And with all of that being said, the country has come together like I’ve never seen it before.  And we will prevail. We will win.  And hopefully, it will be in a relatively short period of time.
With that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and show you some of the latest — just the data that has been, I think, brilliantly put together.  And, right after that, I’m going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak.  And Mike Pence is going to give you some of the recent events that have taken place and some of the statistics that we have that I think will be very interesting to hear.
Thank you very much.  Please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  If I can have the first slide, please.
(A slide presentation begins.)
So always — and that’s what this slide is labeled, is “Goals of Community Mitigation.”  Really highlighting that this begins in the middle and the end with community.  This community and the community of the American people that are going to have to do the things for the next 30 days to make a difference.
I think you know from that large blue mountain that you can see behind me — and I just want to thank the five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial who helped us tremendously.  It was their models that created the ability to see what these mitigations could do, how steeply they could depress the curve from that giant blue mountain down to that more stippled area.
In their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation.  Yet, through their detailed studies and showing us what social distancing would do, what people — what would happen if people stayed home, what would happen if people were careful every day to wash their hands and worry about touching their faces, that what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these.  And it takes us to that stippled mountain that’s much lower — a hill, actually — down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much.  Next slide please.
Simultaneously, there was a modeler out of the University of Washington that modeled from cases up, utilizing the experience around the globe to really understand how this information that we have from Italy and Spain and South Korea and China could really help us give insight into the hospital needs, the ventilator needs, and really the number of people who potentially could succumb to this illness.  It is this model that we are looking at now that provides us the most detail of the time course that is possible.  But this model assumes full mitigation.
It’s informed every morning or every night by the reality on the ground coming in from New York, New Jersey, and around the United States, and is modeled and informed every morning so that it is adjusted so it is up to date every day.  This is the model of the predicted fatalities and mortality in the United States.  And as the President said, it’s very much focused on the next two weeks and the stark reality of what this virus will do as it moves through communities.
Next slide, please.
But this is a slide that gives us great hope and understanding about what is possible.  On the bottom of the slide, where you can barely see that blue line at the very bottom, that’s the current cases in California, the cumulative cases in California, where they’re doing significant testing.
The next line up is Connecticut.  The orange line is New Jersey.  The blue line is New York.  The yellow line is Washington.  We all remember Washington State.  It was just a month ago when they started to have the issues in Washington State, but they brought together their communities and their health providers, and they put in strong mitigation methods and testing.  And you can see what the result in Washington State and California is.  But without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change.
Next slide, please.
So I’m sure you’re interested in seeing all of the states.  So on this slide is all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  But I think it shows in stark reality the difference between New York and New Jersey and other states with similar populations in urban areas.
Our goal, over the next 30 days, is to ensure the states that you see — the 48 across the bottom — maintain this lower level of new cases with the hope that we don’t have significant outbreaks in other states, in other metro areas, as the community comes together to work together and ensure that the healthcare providers around the globe and in the United States are strengthened by our resolve to continue to mitigate community by community.
This is done community by community.  We all know people are in their states and in their communities.  And we’re very dependent on each person in the United States doing the same thing: following the presidential guidelines to a tee.  I know it’s a lot to ask because you’ve done it for 15 days.
So if you can show the next slide, please.
So this is what gives us a lot of hope.  This is the case finding in Italy.  And you can see that they’re beginning to turn the corner in new cases.  They’re entering their fourth week of full mitigation and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country, to change the course of this pandemic together.  It is this graphic and the graphic of many of the states that gives us hope of what is possible with continuing for another 30 days.
Amidst all that hope, I must say that like we warned about Detroit and Chicago, we start to see changes in Massachusetts.  New Orleans continues to be a problem of new cases, although they’re stabilizing.  And I think it really shows the depth of dedication of the American people to the healthcare providers, because they can see the strain that this puts on every nurse, doctor, respiratory therapist, pharmacists, and laboratory technician.  It’s working together to stem this tide of unrelenting sick people coming to their doors.  No one has been turned away.  No one who has needed ventilation has not received ventilation.  But you can see how stressful it is for each of them.
So I know it’s stressful to follow the guidelines, but it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line.
As we started and — we will end with it’s communities that will do this.  There’s no magic bullet.  There’s no magic vaccine or therapy.  It’s just behaviors.  Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Deborah.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Dr. Birx, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  So what Dr. Birx has really said very simply is that there are really two dynamic forces that are opposing each other here.  As I mentioned several times in our briefings, the virus, if left to its own devices, will do that dark curve that Dr. Birx showed you.  The other dynamic force is what we are doing, what we’re trying to do, and what we will do in the form of mitigation.
Now, these are very revealing bits of data because you saw what happened in Italy where you make the turn around the curve and you go.  That doesn’t happen all at once.  It’s a stepwise fashion.  And if I explain the steps, which I will, you’ll see why we are really convinced that mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us.  Because what you have is you have an increase in new cases at a certain rate.  When the increase in new cases begin to level off, the secondary effect is less hospitalizations, the next effect is less intensive care, and the next effect is less deaths.
The deaths and the intensive care and the hospitalization always lag behind that early indication that there are less new cases per day — the way we saw in Italy and the way we’re likely seeing — I don’t want to jump the gun on it — we’re seeing little inklings of this right now in New York.
So what we’re going to see, and that’s — we got to brace ourselves in the next several days to a week or so — we’re going to continue to see things go up.  We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work.
The slide that Dr. Birx showed, where you saw New York and New Jersey and then the cluster of other areas, our goal, which I believe we can accomplish, is to get to hotspot places — the New Yorks, the New Jersey — and help them to get around that curve, but as importantly, to prevent those clusters of areas that have not yet gone to that spike, to prevent them from getting that spike.  And the answer to that is mitigation.
Now, the 15 days that we had of mitigation clearly have had an effect, although it’s tough to quantitate it because of those two opposing forces.  But the reason why we feel so strongly about the necessity of the additional 30 days is that now is the time, whenever you’re having an effect, not to take your foot off the accelerator and on the brake but to just press it down on the accelerator.  And that’s what I hope and I know that we can do over the next 30 days.
And as I said the other day and on one of the — one of the interviews, we are a very strong and resilient nation.  If you look at our history, we’ve been through some terrible ordeals.  This is tough.  People are suffering.  People are dying.  It’s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this, but this is going to be the answer to our problems.  So let’s all pull together and make sure, as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, I know I speak on behalf of the President and people all across this country when I express our great admiration and appreciation to both of you for helping to steer our nation through this challenging time.
The American people have now seen what the President saw when he made the decision at the end of “15 Days to Slow the Spread” to ask the American people to give us 30 more days to continue to put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America.  And as you just heard from the experts, we have reason to believe that it’s working.
As Dr. Fauci just said, there are difficult days ahead.  Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families that have lost loved ones and those, as the President has just reflected, who we know are struggling at this hour in hospitals across the nation.
But to each and every one of us, do not be discouraged because what you can do to protect your health, the health of your family; what you can do to ensure that our healthcare providers have the resources and our hospitals have the capacity to meet this moment is put into practice: the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America.
It really is what every American can do: “30 Days to Slow the Spread,” 30 days to make a difference in the lives of the American people, American families, and the life of our nation.
Allow me to give you a few brief updates before the President takes questions.
First and foremost, we continue to work very closely with governors around the nation.  The President and I spoke to all the governors, all the states and territories yesterday.  And since we were last together, the President and I have spoken directly to several governors around the country, including Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and other states.
At the present moment, the President has declared 29 major disaster declarations and authorized 10 different states to use full federal funding, so-called Title 32 funding, to pay for their National Guard.
And, as of this afternoon, FEMA reports some 17,000 National Guard has been activated in states around the country to provide support for coronavirus response.
On the subject of testing, we have now completed more than 1.1 million tests around the country.  We’re working very closely with governors around America to — to assist them in drive-through and community testing centers.
I spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois today about a testing center that they’ve established in cooperation with the U.S. Public Health Service.
We remind every governor and every laboratory and hospital in the country it’s imperative that you continue to report daily to the CDC the results of those tests to give us the visibility on the data to best inform resource decisions.
Also, we — we reiterated today to governors in person, and also through correspondence to every governor, the importance of using their National Guard, if need be, to move medical supplies.  FEMA is very busy, as you’ll hear in a moment, delivering literally millions of supplies to states around the country.  But we’re urging every governor to make sure to work with their state emergency management team and maybe use the National Guard to move those supplies from warehouses to hospitals.
At the present moment, as the President said, we’ve distributed more than 11.6 million N95 masks, more than 8,100 ventilators around the nation, millions of face shields, surgical masks, and gloves.
We initiated an air bridge that the President announced yesterday.  Flights have arrived in New York, one arrived in Illinois yesterday, and a flight will arrive in Ohio in the next 24 hours.
FEMA is literally working and contracting around the world with now more than 51 flights that will be bringing vital medical supplies.
On the subject of ventilators, FEMA is currently delivering 400 ventilators to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Louisiana, 50 ventilators to Connecticut, and in the last week and in the week ahead, more than 450 ventilators to Illinois.  This is in addition to more than 4,400 ventilators that the President and FEMA directed to the state of New York.
We just want people that are working on the frontlines, that the President just spoke about, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci spoke about — we want you to know help is on the way.  And, at the President’s direction, we’re going to leave no stone unturned anywhere in America or anywhere in the world to make sure that you have the resources and the equipment to do your job.
So again, I want to just say, “Thank you, America.”  Thank you for stepping up.  Thank you for putting into practice the “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  And thank you for the response that tens of millions have already had for the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”
We encourage each one of you, as we have governors around the country, to spread the word about the guidelines, listen to your state and local authorities in areas that are more greatly impacted.  We continue to urge people in the areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from travel around the country.  And people who’ve traveled from that area, check your temperature and self-quarantine for 14 days.
You can see from that chart the unique challenges people in the Greater New York City area are facing with the coronavirus.  And we want to do all that we can to protect your health, focus resources on the community, and prevent unnecessary spread.
Lastly, as the President highlighted yesterday, businesses around America are stepping up as never before.  Tomorrow, I’ll travel with Secretary Sonny Perdue to Gordonsville, Virginia, to the Walmart distribution center, just so the American people can see firsthand how the food supply is continuing to roll on 18 wheels and through air freight all over America.
And we thank again the grocery store operators around America and everybody that’s working out on the highways and byways every day to keep that food supply rolling, and rolling strong.
To the American people though, we just want to assure you that we’re going to continue to work our hearts out — work our hearts out to make sure our healthcare providers have everything they need, that anyone struggling with coronavirus has the support and healthcare they need.
And I’m absolutely confident, seeing the way our governors are responding and seeing this team the President has assembled in the White House Coronavirus Task Force, confident of the prayers of the American people that we’ll get through this.  But it will take all of us doing our part, and we’ll get through it together.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-15/

5:12 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Very comfortable here.  A lot of room.  And we appreciate you being here.
Yesterday I announced that we would be extending our social distance guidelines through the end of April.  This is based on modeling that shows the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks.  The same modeling also shows that, by very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives.  Think of that: 1 million American lives.
Our future is in our own hands, and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and, really, the fate of our victory.  We will have a great victory.  We have no other choice.  Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war.  Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus.  This is our shared patriotic duty.
Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days.  We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days.  So important because we have to get back.  But the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis.  And that’s the time we’re waiting for.  The more we commit ourselves now, the sooner we can win the fight and return to our lives.  And they will be great lives — maybe better than ever.
Today we reached a historic milestone in our war against the coronavirus.  Over 1 million Americans have now been tested — more than any other country, by far; not even close — and tested accurately.
And I think what I’d like to do is ask Secretary Azar, who’s done a fantastic job, to come up and just say a few words about the fact that we reached substantially now more than 1 million tests.
Please.  Thank you, Alex.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in marshaling all the resources that we have for this unprecedented testing effort.  And thank you, Mr. Vice President, for leading a whole-of-economy approach to testing.
As the President mentioned, today the United States hit more than 1 million samples tested — a number that no other country has reached.  We’re now testing nearly 100,000 samples a day, also a level that no other country has reached.
I want to thank every partner that has been involved in this effort.  That includes all of the men and women of the FDA and the CDC, including Director Redfield and Commissioner Hahn.  Together, the FDA and CDC have worked to balance the need for testing on an aggressive scale with the scientific rigor that Americans expect.
Working with our testing coordinator, Admiral Giroir, they have now truly unleashed the ingenuity of the private sector and our state and local leaders, the centerpieces of America’s historic approach to testing.
I want to thank those state and local leaders who have used their on-the-ground resources and knowledge to lead testing and make it much more easily accessible to the Americans who need it.  I’m also grateful to FEMA, with whom we are now working closely to get state and local partners what they need.
I also want to thank CMS, where Administrator Verma has given healthcare providers unprecedented flexibility to scale up capacity for testing and treatment, and has ensured that tests will be paid for.
Finally, we would not be where we are today without the many American companies, entrepreneurs, and scientists who have worked day and night to develop, as of today, 20 different emergency testing options.  With the FDA responding to request for authorization typically within 24 hours, the number of options is growing nearly every day.  FDA has also opened up new options for using the available tests, like self-swabbing and new options for reagents.
I also want to thank FDA and other components of HHS for incredibly rapid action on other tools that we need.  This weekend, we actually worked to secure 30 million tablets from Sandoz and 1 million tablets from Bayer of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which are potential COVID-19 treatments.  And we authorized Battelle’s new decontamination machines, which can each sterilize thousands of essential N95 masks for reuse every day.
So thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and thank you to everybody who’s played a part in getting us where we are today.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to come up — FDA — because we have some really good stuff.  First of all, the numbers have been incredible on testing, but in the days ahead, we’re going to go even faster.  And we have something from Abbott Labs, which is right here, and that’s a five-minute test, highly accurate.
And I maybe can show that as we listen to our FDA Commissioner — the job he’s done in the approval process.  We talked about the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine just now.  I thought that I’d mention it, but Alex has already done that, but we have that now under test with 1,100 people in New York.  And it was only the fast approval by FDA that allowed us to do that.  It was a really rapid approval.
And, Doctor, please say a few words.  And this is the first one on the line of the five-minute test from Abbott.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the task force.  I’m very proud of FDA staff’s work in the last few months to expedite the availability of testing in this country.  I’m also incredibly appreciative of private industries’ ingenuity and willingness to work with us quickly to develop and distribute those tests.
We’ve had a substantial addition to testing with the authorization of point-of-care tests, especially the Abbott point-of-care test, which the President has pulled out of the box.
A point-of-care test is a test that gives you a result where you’re getting care.  This is truly a patient-centered approach — whether it’s the doctor’s office, a hospital, an emergency room, an urgent care center, or a drive-by testing site.
Just like tests for flu or strep, where go to the doctor’s and you can get the test done, you can get an answer within minutes of having this test done.  Now, with those tests being approved for Abbott and for others, these are available around the country.  They’re planning to scale up the number of tests that can be put out throughout the country over the next month.  And patients can get the answer within as little as 15 to 5 minutes.  And then, of course, an appropriate plan of treatment can be given.
We at FDA are working quickly with Abbott, as well, and other testing approaches.  And normally these tests take months to develop.  I was on the phone today with the Abbott CEO.  He told me that normally this is a 9- to 12-month approach to developing a point-of-care test.  They did this in collaboration with FDA and U.S. government within weeks.
Abbott has shared that they will be delivering these tests tomorrow and then will be ramping up.  I’d just like to emphasize one thing: The most innovative and safe products come from the private sector in partnership with government, taking an all-hands-on-deck approach, just like in this case.  And the other point here is that Abbott and FDA worked together to make sure that we had a fast, reliable, and accurate test to market.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor.  Great job too.  Really great job.  Thank you, Steve.
So, the pharmaceutical company, Sandoz, has been working with us very closely.  And as Alex mentioned a little bit, 30 million doses of the hydroxychloroquine to the United States government has been given.  And Bayer has donated 1 million doses of the chloroquine, which will soon be distributed to states and state health officials around the country.  Teva Pharmaceuticals is also donating 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to U.S. hospitals.  That’s 6 million doses.
So the private sector, as you’d say, Steve, has been amazing, what’s happened.  Really amazing.  And we’re going to introduce you to some of the greatest business executives in the world today, no matter where you go, and they’re going to say a little bit about what they’re doing.  And then we have so many more.
The FDA has also authorized the — Battelle’s N95 respirator mask sterilization kits.  It’s an incredible thing.  I’ve been asking, “Why are we throwing these masks away?”  You look at some of these masks and they’re significant pieces of equipment.  And I say, “How come you throw them away?  Why aren’t they using sterilization techniques?”
And I got a call from Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio — and he’s a tremendous guy, a tremendous governor — and he said, “We have a company named Battelle, and they’re having a hard time getting approval from the FDA.”  And I called up Dr. Hahn, and within a very short period of time, they got the approval.  Steve, we really appreciate it.  I want to thank Mike and I want to thank Steve.
And they’re going to be able — each machine now can disinfect 120,000 masks per day.  Now, think of that.  Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day.  It’ll be just like a new one.  It can go up to about 20 times for each mask.  So each mask can go through this process 20 times.  And they have two in Ohio, one in New York, and one will soon be shipped to Seattle, Washington, and also to Washington, D.C.  So that’s going to make a tremendous difference on the masks.
This morning, I spoke to our nation’s governors to help each state get the medical supplies they need.  And yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence asked our nation’s hospitals to begin reporting total bed capacity, ICU bed capacity, ventilator capacity, and vital medical supply levels on a daily basis.  And, Mike, thank you for the great job.  Thank you very much.
In New York, the 2,900-bed hospital under construction, which is now completed — they completed it in three days; you might say three and a half days — at the Javits Center will be completed today.  Will be — and when you look — so they’re going up.  I think we’re going to be adding some more beds, which will be completed today.
And we’ve opened up — whoops, there goes our box.  And my hair is blowing around, and it’s mine.  (Laughter.)  The one thing you can’t get away with.  If it’s not yours, you got a problem, if you’re President.
And nearly 3,000 medical beds will become operational.  The U.S. Navy ship Comfort also arrived today, equipped with 12 operating rooms and 1,000 hospital beds.  Work has begun on additional temporary hospital sites, including a 600-bed capacity nursing home facility in Brooklyn, and numerous floors of a high-rise building on Wall Street.
So it’s been really pretty amazing what they’ve done, and the Army Corps of Engineers, what they’ve done.  They’ve done — they just completed — think of it — a 2,900-bed hospital in New York in just about three days, maybe four days.  And the whole city is talking about it.
On top of that, we floated in a great ship, which is going to be 1,000 rooms, which is being used for patients outside of what we’re focused on.  And that will free up a lot of rooms for what we’re focused on.  So, it’s been great.
The Army Corps of Engineers has awarded contracts for the construction of alternate care facilities, also, at the State University at Stony Brook, State University Old Westbury, and the Westchester Community Center.  We’re sending 60 ambulances to New York City today.  We have a total of 60.  We’re getting some additional ones, with up to 190 more to follow at different locations.
To date, FEMA has obligated more than 1.3 million dollars — billion dollars in federal support to the State of New York.  So we’re spending a lot of money in New York.  It’s a hot — it’s a hotbed.  There’s no question about it.  And we’re spending a lot of time, effort on New York, New Jersey.  Spoke with Governor Cuomo a lot.  Spoke with Governor Murphy a lot, in New Jersey.  And we’re — we’re really getting the job done.  People are very impressed, and I’m very impressed by the people in FEMA, the people in the Army Corps of Engineers because what they’ve done, I’ve never seen anybody do anything like it.
In addition to the 8,100 ventilators that we’ve already delivered over the next 48 hours, we’re delivering more than 1,000.  We’re going — 400 ventilators are going to Michigan very shortly, 300 going to New Jersey, 150 ventilators to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana, and 50 to Connecticut.
FEMA and HHS already delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22 million gloves.
And I don’t know if you just saw it.  It just came over the wires that Ford just announced, just a little while ago, that they will produce, along with General Electric Healthcare, 50,000 ventilators, and they’re going to be doing it in less than 100 days.
On top of that, we have other companies that are doing ventilators, including General Motors.  But we have nine other companies doing ventilators.  As we outpace what we need, we’re going to be sending them to Italy.  We’re going to be sending them to France.  We’re going to be sending them to Spain, where they have tremendous problems, and other countries as we — as we can.  But the fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies.
More than 14,000 National Guard members have been activated and can help supplement state and local efforts to distribute personal protective equipment, where we’re sending a lot.  We have planeloads coming in.  We have 51 loads from various locations all around the world, and they’re landing.  We had our first big cargo plane land this morning, and we’re getting it from all over the world.
And we’re also sending things that we don’t need to other parts.  I just spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy, and we have additional capacity.  We have additional product that we don’t need.  We’re going to be sending approximately 100 million dollars’ worth of things — of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy.  And Giuseppe was very, very happy — I will tell you that.  They’re having a very hard time.
Joining us this afternoon are CEOs of the great American companies that are fulfilling their patriotic duty by producing or donating medical equipment to help meet our most urgent needs.  What they’re doing is incredible.  And these are great companies.
Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell — you know that.  And Darius has been somebody that I’ve dealt with in the past, and he’s a great leader of a great company.
Debra Waller of Jockey International.
A friend of mine, Mike Lindell of MyPillow.  Boy, do you sell those pillows.  That’s unbelievable what you do.
David Taylor of Procter & Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies Corporation.
And I just want to tell all of you that America is very grateful to you and what you’ve done.  An amazing job you’ve done, and we thank you very much.
I’d like you to come up and say a couple of words, if you might, about your companies.  Mike, come on up.  Come on up, fellas, please.  Come on up.  You have to say what you’re doing because it’s been really incredible.
Go ahead, Mike.
MR. LINDELL:  Okay, well, MyPillow is a U.S. vertically integrated company, which has been forced to adjust to the changing business environment as a result of the pandemic.  MyPillow’s unique position as a U.S. company functions as a manufacturer, logistics management distributor, and direct-to-consumer.  Given our current business lines, we are experiencing the effects of this pandemic firsthand.
What MyPillow has done — we’ve established an internal task force, which is monitoring future needs of companies across the country as a result of this pandemic.  And given our position, we’ve begun to research and develop new protocols to address the current and future needs of U.S. businesses across multiple sectors, how companies are going to prepare themselves when they once again open up, and changes to their current operations in order to adjust to future threats and pandemics.
MyPillow has designated some of its call centers to help U.S. companies navigate the many issues that resulted from this pandemic.  We’ve dedicated 75 percent of my manufacturing to produce cotton facemasks.  In three days, I was up to 10,000 a day.  By Friday, I want to be up to 50,000 a day.
I proud to manufacture our products in the United States, and I’m even more proud to be able to serve our nation in this great time of need.  Thank you, Mr. President, for your call to action when — which has empowered companies like MyPillow to help our nation win this invisible war.
Now, I wrote something off the cuff, if I can read this.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.
MR. LINDELL:  (Laughs.)  God gave us grace on November 8th, 2016, to change the course we were on.  God had been taken out of our schools and lives.  A nation had turned its back on God.  And I encourage you: Use this time at home to get — home to get back in the Word, read our Bibles, and spend time with our families.
Our President gave us so much hope where, just a few short months ago, we had the best economy, the lowest unemployment, and wages going up.  It was amazing.  With our great President, Vice President, and this administration and all the great people in this country praying daily, we will get through this and get back to a place that’s stronger and safer than ever.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s very nice.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike.  Appreciate it.
Please come on up.  I did not know he was going to do that, but he’s a friend of mine, and I do appreciate it.  Thank you, Mike, very much.
Please.
MR. ADAMCZYK:  First of all, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, the entire administration, and all the agencies, thank you for your strong leadership during this time of crisis.  It is noticed and it’s making a difference.
Second of all, I’d like to say a big thank you to all the healthcare workers out there.  You’re putting yourself in harm’s way every day, and we really respect what you’re doing, and we couldn’t be thankful enough for it.  And I can tell you that more help is on the way.
We, as Honeywell, we’re an industrial technology company.  And one of the businesses that we’re in: We protect the industrial worker.  But what we’re doing today is we’re repurposing a lot of that equipment to serve the healthcare worker.
A few days ago, we announced the start-up of a new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island.  We’re going to be hiring 500 employees.  We have already 200 onboard.  And we’re going to be starting the production of N95 masks within the next two weeks.
Furthermore, today we’re announcing the start-up of another manufacturing facility in Arizona.  We’re going to be hiring another 500 people.  And we’re going to be starting up production in that facility by the middle of May.  So, in total, we’ve doubled our production of N95 masks already.  It’s going to double again within the next 60 days.  And then within the next 90 days, we’re going to have 5x the capacity we do today.
Furthermore, we’re going to be providing other safety equipment to support all the efforts going out.
Lastly, I’ll say a big thank you to all the Honeywell employees, and also announce a $10 million fund for them, for all the hourly and administrative employees who are having a hard time during this time of crisis.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  Normally, I’d shake his hand, but we’re not supposed to do that anymore.  So, that’s okay.  Great job.  Thank you to Honeywell.
Please, go ahead.  Debra, please.
MS. WALLER:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr.  Vice President, on your guidance during this unprecedented time.  And I’m very honored to be here today.  Founded by a minister 144 years ago, Jockey International is a family-owned company headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Since 1876, we have been providing socks and underwear for generations of families.
It is part of our DNA to roll up our sleeves and help our country in her time of need.  During World War Two, we made parachutes for the military.  And today, we are eager to serve this great country by providing support for the healthcare workers on the frontlines of this fight.  As the President and Vice President have said, it’s a whole-of-America approach and we are committed.
Jockey has had a longstanding partnership with Encompass Group, headquartered in Georgia, serving the healthcare community.  When we learned of the critical need for PPE, we knew we had to help.  That meant restarting production on tier three isolation gowns.  Monumental lifting by Jockey, Encompass, FEMA, and the FDA was done in just a few days to be production ready.  As a result, we expect to begin delivering 30- to 50,000 gowns per week, helping those that need it the most right now.
In addition, this week we are also donating 10,000 units of scrubs to the frontline doctors and nurses at the Javits Convention Center in New York City.  We would not have been able to do this without the collaboration of the administration, representatives from the federal agencies, and Congressman Bryan Steil.
Thank you very much, Mr. President and Mr. Vice — Mr. Vice President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MS. WALLER:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.  Thank you very much.
MR. TAYLOR:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for bringing us together today.  I’m proud to be able to represent the men and women of Procter & Gamble, who every day, 24 hours a day, are working to build and make essential cleaning products, hygiene products, and healthcare products for families everywhere.  These include healthcare workers and for institutions that are serving those on the frontline.
P&G people are the faces of brands you know and trust — brands like Tide, Pampers, Bounty, Charmin, Mr. Clean, and Vicks.  In addition to making, packing, and shipping these essential items, they’ve worked together to transform our plants to make things we’ve never made before, like hand sanitizers and facial masks.  Some of these are already getting to national, state, and local agencies.  Some of them are in the hospitals already.
Everywhere around the world, PNG people are working every day to serve everybody — consumers.  And they’re working together to bring together the full capability of our research and development, our engineering, our manufacturing, and our communications capability to make sure we make a difference to the consumers we serve and to all the audience that we can make a difference to.  I want to thank them and I’m very grateful for what they do every day in service to others.
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Please.
MR. HAYES:  Mr. President.  Good afternoon.  I’m Greg Hayes from United Technologies, and on behalf of the 240,000 employees of United Technologies and the 70,000 employees at Raytheon, which will join together with UTC this Friday, I want to first of all say thank you to the President and the Vice President for your leadership during what is really a war.  It is a different war than anybody has ever fought before, but it’s a war that we’re uniquely qualified to help.
As one of the world’s largest defense contractors and some of the best technology, we’re using that technology to try and solve some real-world problems.  Today, we’re working with the Air Force to try and help pilots as they’re moving medical evacuees with the COVID-19 virus, such that they can be protected and that the patients can be protected.
Again, we’re working also with logistics.  And if you think about a war, strategy is important, but logistics wins war.  It’s — it’s imperative, I think, with FEMA, along with the Mr. Navarro’s office, that we coordinate all of these activities.  Last week, we donated about 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA.  Next week, we’ll have another almost million.  Again, working through our supply chain partners around the world.
We’re also today — this week, beginning the manufacture of face shields.  Using the additive technologies that we have and the machines that we have available within UTC, we’ll be able to produce approximately 10,000 shields in the next four weeks — again, all needed equipment.  We stand ready to help in any way we can.  We don’t need the Defense Production Act to ask us to act.  All of the people at UTC and Raytheon are focused on this war and winning it.
Again, I also want to say thank you to all of our employees for their work during this crisis, as well as to the frontline medical and other first responders.  Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  Great company.  Those are great companies.  Thank you very much.
I’d like to ask Seema to come up and say a few words about what you’re doing and what’s happening and how positive it’s been.  I really appreciate it.  Come on up, Seema Verma.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And let me start by saying, I want to convey my deepest sympathies to those that have lost loved ones to the coronavirus.  We’re all thinking of you.
Today is Doctors’ Day and, even without it, I want to send a message of gratitude to the foot soldiers in this war: men and women that are providing care and comfort to Americans that have been affected by the virus.  Your country is grateful.
And, in short, as the President has said, we are engaged in a war against an invisible enemy.  In wartime, the assumptions of peacetime must be revisited and adjusted to meet the demands of the moment.  And so, under the President’s leadership, CMS is waiving a wide and unprecedented range of regulatory requirements.  Now, many healthcare systems won’t need these waivers and they shouldn’t use them if they don’t need them, but the flexibilities are there.
In a time of crisis, regulations shouldn’t stand in the way of patient care.  And there are several components to our announcement today, but the first one is CMS’s Hospitals Without Walls, and this is going to allow hospital systems to create new treatment sites outside of their facility to expand capacity and be able to safely separate patients that are infected with the coronavirus and those that are not.
Now, FEMA is doing incredible work, setting up temporary hospitals in New York and other areas.  But under these waivers, we are empowering local communities to complement and augment the work of FEMA and allowing hospital systems to tap into the capacity that already exists in their communities, making use of dorms and hotels or gymnasiums, and allowing the main hospital to focus on those that need the most intensive care.  There are surgery centers out there today that are delaying elective surgeries and they may have excess capacity that can be devoted to hospital-like care.
We’re also making changes to the Medicare program to facilitate testing.  So some people that need a coronavirus test can’t leave their home or patients that are in a nursing home, and now we will pay for labs to go out to these locations and perform testing.
And we’re also expanding the workforce.  We are taking action today to relax some of our regulations to allow hospitals to increase their workforce.  And we’re allowing a broad range of flexibilities so that we can let healthcare workers operate at the top of their license.
And we are also allowing our hospitals to give — to provide more support for our healthcare workers.  Under today’s regulations, they can only provide minimal support to healthcare workers, but now we’re going to allow them to provide child care, meals, laundry services.
And then there’s also telehealth.  The President already directed a dramatic expansion of telehealth to our nation’s 62 million seniors with Medicare.  And we’re so proud of all the healthcare — healthcare providers and patients that have rapidly implemented telehealth.
But today, we’re announcing that we’re going to go even further and we’re going to be paying for doctors to make phone calls with their patients and provide care over the phone.  And we’re getting rid of longstanding barriers to telehealth in the Medicare program, allowing emergency rooms to use telehealth and eliminating requirements that some visits be provided face to face.
And I also want to mention that, on Saturday, the President directed CMS to offer advance payments for healthcare providers that are experiencing cash-flow problems.  We know that many providers are complying with our recommendations to delay nonessential elective surgeries, and they shouldn’t be penalized for doing the right thing.
Now, I’ve barely scratched the surface of all the flexibilities that we are offering healthcare workers and healthcare systems.  These flexibilities will provide a lot of flexibility from regulations that are ill suited to the unprecedented needs of this emergency.  And doctors and nurses and other healthcare professionals that are working long hours and sacrificing times with their families and risking their lives will have the flexibility that they need to confront the needs of the coronavirus pandemic.
And there are many heroes in this war, but I want to take an opportunity to thank the team at CMS.  These folks have worked day and night.  The flexibilities that are in this regulation — in any regulation — usually take CMS a year, but we did this in two weeks, and I couldn’t be more honored and privileged to serve alongside these dedicated public servants.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Seema.  Fantastic job.  And you’re doing a great job.
So, we are in the midst of something that is very difficult, but we are going to win; it’s just a question of when.  We want to do it as quickly as possible.  We want to have as few deaths as possible.
And we will meet again tomorrow for some statistics, and some updates as to where we are, where we think we’re going, and timing.  I think timing is going to be very important because we have to get our country back.  We have to get our country back to where it was and maybe beyond where it was because we’ve learned so much.
But we will have lost a lot of people.  And in many ways, they’re heroes.  And if you look at what’s happening with our medical professionals, it’s a danger.  They’re — they’re warriors.  Men and women are doing a job that — the likes of which I don’t think anyone’s ever seen.  I see them coming out of planes today, going into New York, going into the most dangerous locations, dangerous areas.  And they go in there and they just want to do the job.  And you see the numbers.  You see the numbers like I see the numbers.
I have some friends that are unbelievably sick.  We thought they were going in for a mild stay.  And, in one case, he’s unconscious — in a coma.  And you say, “How did that happen?”
So I just want to thank all of the great professionals: men and women — doctors and nurses and paramedics and first responders and law enforcement.  By the way, if you look at New York and you see how — the effect that this had on law enforcement, it’s been incredible.  These are great people — firefighters.  Great people.  They’re helping in so many different ways.
So, thank you very much.  And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions.  John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

March 29, 2020
5:43 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate everybody being here.  Beautiful day in the Rose Garden.  Tremendous distance between chairs.  Social distancing.  You practice it very well.  We appreciate it.  That’s great.
I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus.
On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightning-fast results in as little as five minutes.  That’s a whole new ballgame.  I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they’ve done.  They’ve been working around the clock.  Normally, this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months, and even longer, but we did it in four weeks.  Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week.
And as you know, even before this development, we’ve been doing more test — tests than any other country anywhere in the world.  It’s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we’ve been testing.  It’s also one of the reasons that we’re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we’ve been doing more testing.  So we have bigger numbers to look at.
I want to also thank General Semonite, of the Army Corps of Engineers, and General Polowczyk, who’s here with us, who’s going to say a few words in a little while.  What the Army Corps of Engineers did, along with FEMA, in New York was incredible.  They built 2,900 beds’ worth of hospital.  An incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well.  And I just want to say that was unreal.  They did it in less than four days.  People have never seen anything like that.  And it’s an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital.  They did it so quickly.  Everyone is trying to figure out how they did it, including me — and I was a good builder.  But they did it very quickly, Mike.  So we’re very — we’re very happy.
So I want to thank Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA — the incredible job they have done.
Now they’re moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals.  We’re doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey — many, many other places.  But these are incredible men and women, and they worked around the clock.
And the people of New York are very happy.  Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate.  But these are — I mean, there’s nobody could have done a job like that.  Most people have never seen anything like it.
The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contain, and ultimately defeat the virus.  We will defeat the virus.  It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus — so important — in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes.  And we will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers and making.
I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients — people in New York — along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin.  And it’s very early yet; it’s only — it started two days ago.  But we will see what happens.
I want to thank Stephen Hahn, who’s a great doctor — left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible Hospital in Texas.  And he’s the head of the FDA.  And Stephen got approval for that so fast.  Let’s see how it works.  It may, it may not.  But we may have some incredible results.  We’re going to know soon.  So it’s tested — it’s being tested on 1,100 people in New York.
The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients.  This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus.  So they’ve recovered; they’re strong.  Something was good in them that worked.  And so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well — meaning, their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus — and transfusing it into six [six] patients — sick patients, very — very, very powerfully.
So, sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system.  We’ll see what happens.  And we’re having some early results that are good, but we will see.  And that’s going, I think, very rapidly.  Again, we got approvals in, really, very quick time.
We’re also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks.  I kept saying to myself — I’d see some of the masks are very complex.  We’re delivering millions, by the way.  Millions.  But I kept saying, “Why aren’t they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?”
And Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, called me.  They have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks, and in some cases, depending on the mask — some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material — they’re able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times.  So that’s, I guess, like getting 20 masks.  And so we worked on that.  As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved, and the FDA is now involved.  And we’re trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks.  That would be a tremendous difference.  That would be really helpful.
While much of the research has to be done — we have a lot of research left to do, obviously — this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries.  We’re in communication with other countries, and very strong communications.  And they’re very reliant on us in just about all cases.  We have the greatest people in the world.  They’re very, very anxious to find out how we’re doing on our different things, whether it’s a cure or whether it’s really anything having to do with getting people better.  We have some interesting things will be announced, I think over the next few weeks, but we’ll see what happens.  They’re being tested right now.
The vaccines are moving along very rapidly.  The vaccines are an answer, but I’d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick.  And we’re working on that at a level that people would be amazed.  These are incredible people.  They don’t stop.
This method also has been used for more than a century — and that’s the blood-related therapy — you know, more than a century to fight off infectious diseases.  So it’s not unusual.  Our level of complexity has changed, but it’s a concept that’s been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic.  And that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody has seen until what we’re facing now.  That was in 1918.  You know what the result of that was; probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed.
And also, other viruses, like the one in this outbreak — this is a very tough one.  This is a tough one because it spreads so quickly, like nothing we’ve seen.  It spreads so easily, so quickly.
We’re unleashing every tool in our nation’s vast arsenal — economic, medal [sic] — medical.  If you look, medical, and scientific, military.  Homeland Security is working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus.
As you know, every level of government — state, local, and federal — is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers.  We’re delivering vast orders of this material.  I’m going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it.
Joining us today are the leaders of America’s largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, Henry Schein, Owens & Minor, Medline, FedEx, and UPS.  We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed.
And maybe I’d like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Kaufmann to come up, and maybe Ed Pesicka.  Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen & Minor.
But I — and I appreciate.  And if anybody else has anything, please come up.  But if you could come up, Mike, for a second and, Ed, for a second.  Just, if you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting.  Thank you.
MR. KAUFMANN:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks for your leadership on this.  Because of that leadership, we have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before.  We have seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people.
And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of our customers because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day.  And we need to do everything we can to make things good for them.  And so it’s been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR. KAUFMANN:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Appreciate it.   Please.
MR.PESICKA:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support you have provided to the industry.  And one of the things we did — we did hear the challenge.  And starting in January, we’ve ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina, where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the U.S. healthcare system.
And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting: One of the issues we’re struggling with is the demand increase.  You know, used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly ten- to twenty thousand masks a week are now using two- to three hundred thousand masks a week.  So you multiply that times the entire pop- — the entire U.S., let alone the same demand outside of the U.S.  That’s part of the issue we’re running into: Is even with a significant ramp-up in supply, you know, there’s still that demand that is — that is much greater than that supply.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR.PESICKA:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  And I bring that up because when we discussed, back in a room — we were in a conference room — a very nice one, actually; it’s called the Cabinet Room — that statement was made that they’ve been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks.  Okay, it’s a New York hospital.  Very — it’s packed all the time.  How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000?  10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000?
Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters.  Where are the masks going?  Are they going out the back door?  How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000?  And we have that in a lot of different places.  So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don’t see, from a practical standpoint, how that’s possible to go from that to that.  And we have that happening in numerous places — not to that extent; that was the highest number I’ve heard.  That’s the highest number you’ve seen, I would imagine, right?
But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals.  He knows the system better than anybody.  And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number.  So thank you very much.  I hope I didn’t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble.  So they have to look at that in New York.
FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States.  The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York, this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment, including 130,000 N95 respirators — those are the ones that we were talking about before — 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves, and many other things.  Millions and millions of different items.
FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily.  We hope to have about 50 flights.  We’re going to have — I think including the one that came in today, we’re up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies.  That was so nice to be here today.  Would you like to say something on behalf?  Please, come up.  Thank you.
MS. LANE:  Thank you, Mr President, for the incredible leadership.  I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort.  Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before, and the way we’re going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort.  We have a Big Brown army — 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver.
We’re bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most.  We’re proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states, we can deliver what is needed everywhere.
So thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job you’re doing.
Please.  Thank you very much.
MR. TYLER:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I would certainly like to echo my colleagues’ comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market and the distributors represented here today has been incredible.  It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks.
Today’s first delivery of Operation Airbridge, I think, is the first evidence that it’s working.  The 51 flights you referenced we’re excited about.  We look to build upon that.  So I would echo my thanks for your leadership, and certainly to the staffs, for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the frontlines providing care.
And maybe just a quick word of thanks, on behalf of all the CEOs here, to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country, in pharmacies across the country, and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going.  The supply chain is working.  It’s resilient.  Supply is a challenge, and we’re tackling that.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Please.
MR. MILLS:  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.  And thanks to FEMA and HHS.  I think great leadership, and it’s really working well.  The demand has skyrocketed, and we’re doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more — other protective apparel.  We are involved in reprocessing masks, and we’ve already started at about 100,000 masks per day, and we hope to expand from there.  So we’re quite optimistic about it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Yeah.
MR. MILLS:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.
Anybody else, if you want?  Yes, please.  You’re doing such a great job, we have to —
MR. CONNETT:  Well, thanks.
THE PRESIDENT:  — have everybody if they want.
MR. CONNETT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts.  Number one, we’ve all talked about PPE products; that’s critical.  And it’s not just to the hospitals — that’s a must — but it’s really to all healthcare providers out there working on the frontline.  So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients.  It’s absolutely key.
Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America.  That is critical.  A lesson to be learned from where we are.
And lastly, we’re proud that we introduced a test.  We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form.  We’re excited about that.  We’ve worked with your administration very closely, and the FDA, and we’re very grateful for that because it’s a quick, rapid antibody test that is needed as well.  So we’re really proud to work with your administration.  All going well.  Thanks so much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.
So thank you all very much and for the great job you’re doing.  It’s really incredible, frankly.  Many of the states are stocked up.  Some of them don’t admit it, but they have — we have sent just so much — so many things to them and — including ventilators.
You know, there’s a question as to hoarding of ventilators.  Some hospitals and independent hospitals — and some hospital chains, as we call them — they are holding ventilators; they don’t want to let them up.  We need them for certain areas where there’s big problems.  We can’t hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road.
So we’ve delivered a lot, and this group has been really fantastic.  We want to thank you.  And UPS and FedEx, in particular, you’ve gone absolutely out of your way, so we appreciate everything you’ve done and delivered.
The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives.
Yesterday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk as the USNS Comfort departed from New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy — anywhere, frankly, in the United States.  It was an incredible thing to see.  Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving.  It left literally three weeks early.  It was under maintenance, and they got the maintenance done very quickly.  They work round the clock as many of the people have.  And it was a great sight.
Additionally, two of the country’s largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna, are announcing that they will waive co-pays — which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance;  they don’t waive co-pays too easily, but we’ve asked them to do it and they’ve done it — coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic.  So they’re waiving co -pays, coinsurance, and deductibles.  Nobody has — I don’t think anyone has heard of that one.  Have you heard of that one before?  I haven’t heard.  I want to thank them.  Great companies.
Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck.  Wolfgang Puck is a great restauranteur, as you know, as is Jean-Georges and Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud, and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest-hit industries.  I’ve directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs incentives to stay open.  You’re going to lose all these restaurants and they’re not going to make it back.  They have to get going.
So what I’m doing is I’m going to tell Secretary Mnuchin and also our great Secretary of Labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago.
And we’re going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants.  I think it’ll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open.  I mean, don’t forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not-too-distant future, and we expect that.  But there are some that aren’t going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do.
So we’re going to look at the restoration — restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so that corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days.  That was when restaurants were doing really well.
The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historic relief for American workers and small businesses, and it includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention.  So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that’s a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the worker.  So it’s $350 billion — job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers.  I mean, how about that?
Three hundred billion dollars in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four.  So they’ll be getting a check for $3,400 for the typical family of four.
Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits.  Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.  The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems, not us.  State.
And I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they’re not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly.  They’re not set up for that.  And I didn’t want to do it but our opponents wanted it, so we did it.  And if they don’t get their money fast, I’m going to ask that we convene the federal government — that we come back to Congress and we’ll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly — and I said that.
But a lot of these systems, they’re so old and so antiquated at the state level that they’re going to — they have the money, and they’re going to get the money very quickly, but they’re not going to be able to distribute it.  So remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money.
Throughout this great national struggle, the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge — every single one in our nation’s history.  More than 90 percent of Americans say they’re staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens and to their country.  Social distancing: That’s the way you win.
These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before.  Family bonds are strengthening.  Neighbors are looking after neighbors.  It’s incredible.  I’m seeing, you’re seeing, everybody is seeing what’s happening.  Communities are rallying for the cause, and all divisions are fading away.
The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need.  It’s up to 151 countries.  So when we say “our nation” — our nation and the world, when you think.  Think of it: 151 countries.  Somebody said to me today that wasn’t in this particular world — they didn’t know that we had that many countries.  A hundred and fifty-one countries.  That’s something.
And some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible.  If you look at Italy, if you look at — France is having big problems.  Spain is having incredible problems.  Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do, a great thing to do.  We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths.  And we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level.  But those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that.
The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare ex- — I mean, we have — and these people are amazing — the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world.  They demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and, ultimately, the number of fatalities.
I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives.  You’re making the difference.  The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks.  So, I’ll say it again: The peak, the highest point of death rates — remember this — is likely to hit in two weeks.  Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won.  That would be the greatest loss of all.
Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period, it’s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines.  Have to follow the guidelines that our great Vice President holds up a lot.  He’s holding that up a lot.  He believes in it so strongly.  The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end.
Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread.  On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people.  So we’ll be having lots of meetings in between, but we’ll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday — probably Tuesday evening — on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we’re doing things the way we’re doing them.
We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery.  We think, by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening.
I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease.  We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic.
With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion.  We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage.  We will win.  And when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed.  We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has — and the world — again.
In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse — this is invisible enemy — and rise to incredible new heights.
So I just want to thank you all for being here.  And we’ll take some questions if you’d like.
Yeah, please.  Kelly.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-14/

March 27, 2020
5:56 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great to have you. And thank you all for being here.  My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic.  It’s been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world.
We’ve had great success over the last month.  We’ve — as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us — purchased and delivered.  And we’ve made it available to the states.  And the governors have been very gracious for the most part, I would say.  There are a couple that aren’t appreciative of the incredible job.  They have to do a better job themselves; that’s part of the problem.
But, generally speaking, I have to tell you the governors have been great.  I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he’s very thankful.  And Governor Cuomo has been very nice.  They’ve — they’ve really appreciated, I think, what the federal government has done.  You look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA; it’s been really incredible.  Nobody has seen — they’ll build hospitals in two or three days — portable hospitals.
This afternoon, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.  Ventilators are a big deal and we’ve delivered thousands of them.  And oftentimes, you don’t need ventilators very much.  Hospitals don’t have very many.  And now we’re — turning out that we have to produce large numbers.  But we’ve been able to do that and we’re going to be doing a lot more.
This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis.  We thought that we had to deal with, as an example, General Motors.  And I guess they thought otherwise; they didn’t agree.  And now they do.  They do agree.  And I think we might be able to pull it.  But we let them know the way we felt, and they can’t be doing that.
We’ll work in partnership with the private sector, but where an emergency exists — and it’s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly — we will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available lawful authorities to get the job done.
This afternoon, I also signed an executive order investing — and very, very strongly investing — the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus — the “invisible enemy,” as we say.
My order also establishes that Peter Navarro — a very trusted person from the White House, and he’s been an incredible — he’s done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going, economically.  But my order establishes that Peter will serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator for the federal government.  That’s a very important position — more important, probably, than it’s almost ever been in our country.
And so I want to congratulate Peter and his family.  It’s — I know he’s going to do a fantastic job.  He’s been doing that job over the last few weeks.  Peter has a PhD in economics from Harvard; has a master in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard.  And he’s a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job.
But I’d like to maybe ask, before I continue, Peter to say a few words, please.  Peter?  Thank you very much.
MR. NAVARRO:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And, of course, you know the Harvard joke: You can tell a Harvard man, you just can’t tell him much.  Right?
THE PRESIDENT:  They can’t tell them much.
MR. NAVARRO:  So, anyway, on a serious note, let me just give you a little idea of the Defense Production Act and why it is so important.  We are engaged in the most significant industrial mobilization since World War Two.  We have a wartime President fighting an invisible enemy.  And we have the full force of government, coupled with the full power of private enterprise, bearing down on this problem for the American people, sir.
What we had to do today with President Trump’s order, with respect to General Motors, I want to give you a little background on that.  We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run, to help people of New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country, as this virus bears down.  And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill.  They’re literally the lifeline for people.
And I’ve personally been working with FEMA, and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible.  And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time — which is to say as soon as possible, sir.
But we did have a problem with GM and Ventec.  On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible.  Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM.  We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days.  So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization.  I salute him for doing so. It’s going to make my job so much easier.
For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation from the private sector.  Today, sir, was the right day to do it.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Peter, and good luck.
My administration is marshalling the full power of the American government, and we will do that, and that’s what we’ve done, and we will continue to do it until our war is won.  Economic, scientific, medical, military, and homeland security — all of this to vanquish the virus.
We are working to sign contracts immediately with the major ventilator companies in the country, including GE, Philips, Medtronic, Hamilton, ZOLL, RedMed[ResMed], Hillrom, and Vyaire.  These are all companies that do this — great companies.
The FDA will be reducing and waiving unnecessary regulations in order to get this done.  We’re going to be getting rid of certain, let’s say, barriers to speed.  We want them to get it done quickly.  They’ve been doing it for a long time.  They’ve been making ventilators for a long time.  Hopefully, General Motors will join in the fray.
Under the normal condition that you would be — regular times — 29,000 ventilators are distributed in the United States each year.  In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units.  And I guess, to put it in other words, in the next 100 days, we’ll receive over three times the number of ventilators made during a regular year in the United States, and that doesn’t include all of the thousands and thousands that we’ve — we’ve given to the various states, a lot of them.
We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York and they didn’t know they got them.  And then we also had thousands put in a warehouse, and that was also for New York.  And they just found out that they were there, so we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed.
Earlier today, I spoke to the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun.  And Boeing will be producing and donating face shields to help our medical professionals on the frontlines.  These are actually pretty intricate, in terms of the plastic and the quality of the materials.  They’re important.  They’ve got to be top of the line and they’re going to do thousands of these a week.  They’ve already tested the production and they’re ready to begin producing all of these shields.  That’s the plastic shields that go over the face.
Boeing is also offering us the use of their — what they call the Dreamlifter cargo plane.  It’s the largest plane in the world.  And this is sort of a picture of it.  They called up just a little while ago.  And that can sort of take anything.  That’s the biggest in the world.  And they’re letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially the heavy product or large quantities of product.
And Boeing will dedicate up to three planes to the mission of flying medical supplies anywhere we need it.  Each plane can carry 63,000 pounds of cargo per flight.  That’s a lot of cargo.
I also signed an executive order giving the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security the authority to activate the Ready Reserve components of the armed forces.  This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees.
We have a lot of people — retirees; great, great military people — they’re coming back in — who have offered to support the nation in this extraordinary time of need.  And they come back in.  They don’t say, “How much?”  They don’t say, “What are we getting paid?”  They just want to come back in.  It’s really an incredible thing to see.  It’s beautiful.
This afternoon, I also signed into law $2.2 trillion in urgently needed relief for our nation’s families, workers, businesses, and Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed.  And the $2.2 trillion goes to $6.2 trillion, depending on need.  So it’s the largest — it’s the largest bill ever signed — and not just emergency relief, but of any kind.  We’ve never signed a bill of that magnitude.
And, you know, incredibly, it was 96 to nothing in the Senate and it was essentially the same thing in Congress.  They did it very quickly in the House.  They did it very, very quickly.  So, if you look at Congress — what they’ve been able to do — the House was a voice vote, I guess they would call it, and something like that rarely takes place.  And 96 to nothing in the Senate for the largest bill in the history of our country.  That’s pretty good.
And I want to thank Republicans, I want to thank Democrats for coming together for the whole of the nation.  And this is a great thing, a great victory.  This is going to save companies that are incredible companies, but that are going to need some help because of what happened.  A month ago, they were outstanding.  They were having the best year they ever had and then we got hit.  And so, we’ll help them out.  It’s thousands and millions of jobs.  It’s millions of jobs.  And I just want to thank everybody for working so hard, and that includes the people standing with me right here.
The legislation extends a vital lifeline to American families and American workers with job retention loans for small businesses — and a big focus of the bill is small businesses.  They’re really the — they’re the energy.  They’re whatever you want to call it, in terms of our nation.  They push.  People have no idea how big a factor — Peter can tell you — the small businesses are in this country, from an economic standpoint, from a job standpoint.
We expand the unemployment benefits for workers very substantially and direct-cash payments will be going to American citizens — substantial.  This legislation also provides a massive increase in funding for hospitals for the Disaster Relief Fund and critical supplies, including masks, respirators, and pharmaceuticals of all types.  And, speaking of pharmaceuticals, as you know, we’re working vaccines.  We’re getting some good response and we’re working on therapeutics and cures.  And we have some very interesting things happening.
This afternoon, Apple launched a new tool created in partnership with our task force, the CDC, and FEMA.  Any individual who is concerned that they might have the virus can now download the free COVID-19 app on their iPhone and answer a set of simple questions about their symptoms and risk factors.  It’s getting to be a very modernized system, indeed.  They’ll soon receive HHS recommendations on what to do next, including whether they should get tested or not.  And again, we only want people to get tested if they — if we think they need it.
In a few moments, Secretary DeVos and Secretary Perdue will discuss new partnerships with the private sector that are providing meals to millions of students while schools are closed.  They’ve both been incredible, the job they’ve done.  I appreciate them very much.
We’re grateful for the assistance of Niren Chaudhary, CEO of Panera Bread Company.  They’ve been so incredible to us and to the people of our country.  And Denton McLane, Chairman of McLane Global Logistics.  And they’ve joined us — they’re onstage with me.  They’re going to speak.
Throughout this ordeal, I have been awed and inspired by the American people more than anything else, more than anyone else.  Americans of every walk of life have followed the guidelines, shown incredible compassion, and sacrificed greatly on behalf of their fellow citizens.  I want every American to know that their selfless and heroic actions are saving lives.  And I want them to know, and I’ve said it before, that I’m very proud to be their President.  I’m very proud of the American people.
My administration is actively planning the next phase in an all-out war against this horrible virus.  We’re now testing nearly 100,000 patients per day — more than anybody in the world — and we have now, as of even a couple of weeks ago, tested more than any other country in the world and our capacity continues to grow.
Widespread surveillance testing will allow us to monitor the spread of the virus — and we’re doing that quite accurately, and Deborah and Tony will be speaking about that; and coordinate with states to contain new hotspots as they arise with a targeted, fact-based and data-bra- — based approach.  It’s all data driven.
This surveillance testing will soon enable us to publish updated guidelines for state and local leaders.  We want every county and region in the country to have the on-the-ground evidence that they need to determine the mitigation measures that are right for them.  Each location is different.  Some are very, very different.  Some are day and night.  Some are in great shape and some aren’t in great shape.  And we’ll be able to have very accurate information very shortly.  We already have a lot of that information.
America is bravely battling this pandemic through cutting-edge science, medical innovation, and rational, deliberate, and determined vigilance.  No effort will be spared in winning this war.  We’re going to win the war.  Hopefully, we’re going to win soon and with as few lives as possible lost.  You see what’s going on all over the world.  You see the lives, you see Italy, you see Spain, you see all of these countries going through so much, going through such hell.  And we’re all in very strong communication, I can tell you.  Our professionals are dealing with them every day, many of the countries.  So many countries, but many of the countries, we’re dealing very directly and closely.
And we’re going to be in very good shape, in terms of certain equipment that’s very hard to get, very hard to manufacture.  And, at the right time, we’ll be distributing that equipment throughout the world to other countries.  Boris Johnson was asking for ventilators today.  As you know, Boris is — he has tested — unfortunately, he has tested positive and that’s a terrible thing.  But he’s going to be great.  I’m sure he’s going to be totally great.  But they want ventilators.  Italy wants ventilators.  Spain wants ventilators.  Germany wants ventilators.  They’re all calling for ventilators.  Well, we’re going to make a lot of ventilators.  And we’ll take care of our needs, but we’re also going to help other countries.
So I just want to thank everybody.  I want to thank our great American citizens.  And a lot of incredible things are happening — really happening — and it’s too bad.  I was saying, before we had the press conference, when we signed — we had a signing ceremony, where we signed the largest bill in our history.  And I said, “Think of it: 22 days ago, we had the greatest economy in the world.”  Everything was going beautifully, the stock market hit an all-time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency, and the world was looking good.  And then we got hit by the invisible enemy and now you have countries all over the world reeling.  But we’re winning it, and we’ll be bigger and better and stronger than we were even before.
And we will also have apparatus in place that works.  We won’t have broken systems.  We’ll have incredible systems so if this should happen again — and hopefully it won’t, but if a thing like it should happen again, we’ll be able to handle it very much more easily.
So with that, I’ll take a few questions.  Steve, please?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/

5:26 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Hello.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Beautiful day.  Very good what you’re doing.  Look at all those empty seats.  Never seen it like that.  Oh, boy.  Well, how the world has changed.  How the world has changed, right?  But it’s going to end up being better than ever.
I want to thank you very much for being here.  And I’d like to update you on the steps we’re taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus.
This morning at 7:55, I spoke to the leaders of the G20.  Had a great meeting.  And we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas.  We’re working together.  The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that, right now, 151 nations have got.  We had:
•    President Alberto Fernández of Argentina
•    Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia
•    President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil
•    Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada
•    President Xi of China
•    President Emmanuel Macron of France
•    Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany
•    Prime Minister Modi of India
•    President Widodo of Indonesia
•    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy
•    Prime Minister Shinzō Abe of Japan.  Congratulations to Japan on making a great decision on the Olympics.  Going to make it next year, 2021.
•    President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico.  I want to thank the President of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military.  We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border, and very few people are getting through — I can tell you that.  And we got to keep it that way.  And we have a great relationship with Mexico now.
•    President Putin of Russia
•    King Salman of Saudi Arabia
•    President Ramaphosa of South Africa
•    President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in: South Korea.  We’re working very hard on that.
•    Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain
•    President Erdoğan of Turkey
•    Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom
•    President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen
•    President of the European Council Charles Michel
•    United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres
•    World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom
•    World Bank President David Malpass
•    and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva
So, that’s a big group but it’s a great group.  It’s — and they were all there — every one of them.  And we talked about the problem.  And hopefully it won’t be a problem for too much longer.
The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts.  We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data — and we’ve been doing that, to a large extent, but we’ll do it even more so — and to inform our — I guess you could say inform each of us on the fight that we’ve got going one way or the other.  It’s a little bit different, but we’re handling it a little bit in different ways.
But there is great uniformity, I think.  We had a — it was a terrific meeting.  Tremendous spirit among all of those countries.  You had 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned.  And tremendous spirit to get this over with.
After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories.  Our team has been in constant communication with the governors, and we had a terrific meeting.
Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, “Oh, we need Tom Brady.”  I said, “Yeah.”  He meant that in a positive way.  He said, “We need Tom Brady.  We’re going to do great.”  And he meant it very positively, but they took it differently.  “They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort.”  That’s only fake news.  And I like Tom Brady.  Spoke to him the other day.  He’s a great guy.
But I wish the news could be — could be real.  I wish it could be honest.  I wish it weren’t corrupt, but so much of it is.  It’s so sad to see.  Just so sad to see.
We had a great meeting.  I tell you what: I’m sure you have tapes of the meeting.  I’m sure that you were able to get tapes very easily.  So you had 50 governors-plus.  And if you had tapes, you’d see it was really — I mean, there was no contention.  I would say virtually none.  I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy, a little bit.  But he’s usually a big wise guy.  Not so much anymore.  We saw to it that he wouldn’t be so much anymore.  But he is — we had a — I mean, I would rate — Mike was there; a lot of the folks in the back were there.  And it was a — it was a great meeting.  It took place at about 12 o’clock.
So we went from the G20 to the governors.  We also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we’re moving through Congress to deliver much-needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses.
I want to thank Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to 0.  And I have to say it’s the largest, by far, and I’m profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need.
The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay.  I think it’s got tremendous support.  When you’re at 96 to nothing — and, as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined, and one — Rand Paul — is — he’s actually got it.  But he’ll — he’ll be better.  He’s been a great guy.  He’s been a great friend of mine, actually.
The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes:
•    Job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll.  That’s pretty good.  Loan forgiveness — keep the workers on the payroll.  That’s pretty good.
•    Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four.
•    Expanded unemployment benefits.  The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.
These are things that — by the way, we have plenty more to go and — but they’re things that nobody has ever had any package like this done.  And I just want to thank them.  Hopefully, it’ll get approved equally easily in the House, really.  I think it will go through pretty well.  From what I hear, virtually everybody.
•    Critical support for the hardest-hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse.
•    Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses, and hospitals.
•    $45 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, more than doubling the amount available.  This is tremendous stuff.
•    $27 billion for the coronavirus response, including $16 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals.
•    $3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and childcare benefits to healthcare workers, first responders, and others on the frontlines of the crisis.  And these are really brave, incredible people, I have to say.  And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don’t even recover.  They’re incredible people.
•    $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement.  We are, as you know, using the Act, but we use it only when necessary.     We use it as leverage.  We generally don’t have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish.
As of today, FEMA has shipped over 9 million N95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves.  And we’re sending more every day, and we’ve got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in.
A lot of great companies are making equipment right now.  The ventilators, obviously they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them.  And we’re going to be in great shape.
We took over an empty shelf.  We took over a very depleted place, in a lot of ways.  As you know, the testing is going very, very well.  And that was obsolete and broken, and we fixed it and it’s been going really good.
And I think, very importantly, the stockpile — we’re really filling it up, and we fill it up rapidly, but we get it out.  Sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead.
And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also.  We’re sort of a — we look — we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing, and if they need help, we do it. But it’s their first responsibility.  Sometimes they just can’t get it, but we load it up and we send it out.  But if we can, we have it sent directly to the state.  We want it to go directly to the point where we want it.
I can now announce something that I think is incredible, what they’ve done in the Navy, because the incredible naval hospital ship the USNS Comfort — which is incredible, actually, when you see it inside — will be underway to New York City on Saturday.
So it’s going to be leaving on Saturday, rather than three weeks from now.  They did the maintenance quickly, and it was going to be there for quite a while longer — another three or four weeks.  And it should be arriving — I told the governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo, that the ship will be arriving in New York Harbor on Monday.
I think I’m going to go out and I’ll kiss it goodbye.  I’ll go — I’ll go to — it’s in Virginia, as you know.  And I will go and we’ll be waving together because I suspect the media will be following.  John, are you going to be following?  Maybe.  You never know.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-12/

5:54 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  So, nice to be with you.  America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus.
I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines, and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat.  More aggressively we commit to social distancing — so important.  Social distancing — such an important phrase.  And we do it right now.  The more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal.
And there are large sections of our country — probably can go back much sooner than other sections.  And we’re obviously looking at that also.  People are asking, “Is that an alternative?”  And I say, “Absolutely, it is an alternative.”
I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida.  That has great significance, as you know, and legal significance.
We’re in a constant grouping, and I can say this: We have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials, including we’ve been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is, by far, the hottest spot.  They’ve got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them.
The governor is doing a very good job.  I spoke to the governor — Governor Cuomo — last night and this morning, and he mentioned that, in his remarks, that he’s using the — that we are using — and I think he feels, because he understands negotiation — he thinks we’re using very appropriately the Defense Production Act.  And we are.  We’re using it where needed.  It’s a great point of leverage; it’s a great negotiating tool.
But I’ve really — I will tell you, there’s tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies.  And I don’t have to use it very much at all.  They want to do it.  As you know, General Motors is involved; Ford is involved; 3M is involved; others are involved.  And they’re all working very hard to produce product — different — all different products.
We had very little product when we came.  We built it up, and we’ve — we give it away as fast as we can to the different states.  We’re also, as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas in New York.  It’s at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center.  We’re doing four hospitals and we’re doing, throughout the state, four medical centers.  They’re somewhat different.
I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge.  I’m working very hard on New York.  It’s really, by far, our biggest problem.  Maybe it will be; maybe it won’t be.  But there’s a lot of good, capable people working on it with us, and our teams are working very well with the state representatives.
We’re also doing some very large testings throughout the country.  I told you yesterday that, in South Korea — and this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon; we had a very good conversation about numerous other things — but they’ve done a very good job on testing, but we now are doing more testing that anybody, by far.  We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks.  And we go up, on a daily basis, exponentially.  So, it’s really good.
By the way, while I’m on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan last night, and I congratulated him on a wise choice.  I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics — 2021.  I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics.  It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full, beautiful Olympics.  It’s going to be very important because it’s probably the first time, maybe ever, or certainly in a long time, that it was on a odd year.  It always on an even year, they tell me.  But he’s going to have a fantastic success, and now they’ll have even more time.  He didn’t need any more time.  Everything was perfectly ready.  What a job they’ve done.
But Japan — I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision.  I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics.  I told him I’ll be there.  I’ll be there.
As we fight to protect American lives, we’re also protecting American livelihoods.  Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families, and businesses.  This legislation, in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes, as you know, sick leave, and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families.
But we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers.  And that’s a big thing: no cost to the employers.  We want to get everybody back, working.
Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything, I believe, ever passed in Congress.  Perhaps, relatively speaking, if you go back — look during the FDR New Deal days — there was something that if you time-value it, you could say it was bigger.  I don’t know.  But this is certainly, in terms of dollars, by far and away the biggest ever, ever done.  And that’s a tremendous thing because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs, and families, families, families.
The Senate bill, as you know, includes:
$350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses
with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers.  They continue paying their workers.  That’s what we want: We want them to keep their workers and pay their workers.  This will help businesses keep workers in the payroll and allow our economy to quickly accelerate as soon as we defeat the virus.
$350 billion in direct cash payments will
be available for every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year.  That would be $3,400, very quickly, for the typical family of four.  Nothing like that has ever been done in our country.
Up to $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits.  The
average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.  Unlike normal unemployment benefits, independent contractors and the self-employed will be eligible.  So you have independent contractors and self-employed people will be eligible for this.
Over $100 billion to support the heroic work of our
doctors, nurses, and hospitals.  They’ve been incredible.
$45 billion for Disaster Relief Fund.  So we
are setting up a fund of $45 billion for disaster relief.  That’s more than doubling the amount available to support my national emergency and disaster declarations.  It’s a doubling up.
$27 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile
with critical supplies, including masks, respirators, pharmaceuticals, and everything you can imagine — because it was very depleted, like our military was depleted.  Now we have a brand-new military.  Never had a military like this.  We have equipment either coming or it’s already come.  For the most part, it’s already come.  But we have a lot of things that will soon be coming — planes, missiles, rockets, lots of things.  But the stockpile was very depleted, like everything else.
This will also include significant funding for the
development of vaccines on top of the $8 billion we approved several weeks ago.
Over $500 billion in support for the hardest-hit
industries, with a ban on corporate stock buybacks, which is something I insisted on, and frankly, I tell you, the Republicans wanted that and the Democrats wanted that.  We want them to use the money for the companies and the planes, or whatever they may be helping to get over this rough patch.  And I don’t think it’s going to end up being such a rough patch.  I think it’s going to, when we open — especially, if we can open it — the sooner, the better — it’s going to open up like a rocket ship.  I think it’s going to go very good and very quickly.
And you’re going to have some tough new limits on executive compensation also.  They need the money.  They’re going to have to, sort of, just make things work, because we’re interested in the workers, the jobs.  And we’re interested in the companies because that’s really what fuels the workers in those great jobs.
And we also have $16 billion in funding for the purchase of
personal protective equipment — you know about that — such as masks and respirators through the Strategic National Stockpile.
I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation and send the bill to my desk for signature.  Without delay, I will sign it immediately.  We will have a signing, and it’ll be a great signing and a great day for the American worker and for American families and, frankly, for American companies, some of which were having the best years they’ve ever had these last few years.  And then, a little bit less than a month ago, they went into a position that they haven’t seen because of the hidden enemy, the virus.
Earlier today, I spoke to leaders of many of America’s amazing nonprofit organizations.  I thanked them for their unwaving [sic] and unwavering devotion to American people, to American families, to our nation.  And they have been fantastic.  They’ve been collecting supplies, distributing food, supporting healthcare workers, caring for vulnerable workers and families.  I encourage them to continue to do it.  But I’ll tell you, the nonprofits have been fantastic; they’ve been great.  They’re great people, actually.  I know a lot of them.
Finally, I want to provide a brief update on the critical supplies.  Through FEMA, the federal government has delivered, or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators — think of that: 9.4 million — 20 million surgical masks, and we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly.  The whole world — you know, it’s not just us; it’s not just the States.  The whole world is trying to get these things — in competition with many, many countries.
I believe today you broke the 150 mark for the virus.  We have 150 countries — over 150 countries where you have this virus.  And nobody would ever believe a thing like that’s possible.  Nobody could have ever seen something like this coming, but now we know, and we know it can happen and happen again.  And if it does, somebody is going to be very well prepared because of what we’ve learned and how we’ve done.  It’s been incredible, how we’ve done.
Remember this: More tests than anybody, by far.  And the news, the reporters, the media always likes to bring South Korea — they called me and they told me, “It’s amazing.  Your testing procedures are amazing.”  Plus, we have a test that’s a very high-level test, and it’s a test that’s very accurate.
3.1 million face shields, 2.6 million surgical gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and almost 6,000 ventilators, which go to the areas of greatest needs.  We sent, over the last day, 4,000 ventilators to New York.  And I spoke with the governor about that; he was happy.  I spoke with the mayor also about that.  Mayor de Blasio, he was very happy.  It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing — that, I can tell you.
Throughout this national emergency, everyday heroes continue to step forward and demonstrate the extraordinary character of our nation, including the people behind me.  By the way, these people are amazing.  They are amazing people and they become — I don’t know, maybe I should just speak for myself, but to me, they’ve become friends.  Maybe they don’t like me.  Maybe they don’t; maybe they do.  I don’t know.  All I can tell you is they’re talented people.  They work very hard.
In Maryland, a 7-year-old boy used his own birthday money to buy meals for dozens of senior citizens.  In Nevada, a college student recruited 90 of her friends to help deliver groceries and supplies to the most vulnerable.  This is happening all over the country.  Thousands and thousands of instances.  I could stand up here all day and tell you about other things.  In Minnesota, hundreds of medical students have volunteered to provide childcare for hospital workers, helping to keep our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, fighting to save lives.
These inspiring Americans remind us that we all have a role to play in winning this great national battle.  And it’s really a worldwide battle.  We’re dealing with other nations all the time.  The people here are — and I am a little bit — I take calls from a lot of people; they’re in trouble.  A lot of countries are in big trouble.
So now we will hear from our great Secretary of the Treasury.  He has been working rather hard, I will tell you.  Steve Mnuchin is a — he’s a fantastic guy and he loves our country, and he’s been dealing with both sides — Republican and Democrat.  He, sort of, lived over in that beautiful building.  It’s a very beautiful building.  To me, one of the most beautiful buildings, actually, in the world.  And he’s gotten to know it, Steve, very well.
So if we could have a little update, Steve, it would be fantastic, as to how we’re doing and what it’s looking like.
Thank you.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And first, let me say, I would like to thank Mitch McConnell for his leadership.  And I’d also like to thank Chuck Schumer for the enormous bipartisan support we had on this bill, and the many senators, both Republicans and Democrats, that work tirelessly over the last five days on all the task force.
As the President said, I got to live in the LBJ room for the last five days, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the unprecedented response from the Senate to protect American workers and American business in this situation.
The President has outlined many of these, but let me just quickly go through them.
Again, small business retention loans: This will cover roughly 50 percent of the private payroll in small businesses where we will immediately make loans that will supply eight weeks of salaries, as long as they keep workers employed and overhead.  And those loans will be forgiven at the end of the period, as long as they keep workers employed.
These are SBA loans, but the Treasury will be issuing new regulations authorizing almost every single FDIC-insured bank to make these.  I expect, by the end of next week, we will have a very simple process where these can be made and dispersed in the same day.  So this will be a very simple system to get money into small-business hands.
For companies that don’t qualify that, we have an economic program of tax incentives to retain workers.  And as the President said, we have enhanced unemployment insurance for people that don’t fit into these two programs that will be administered through the states.
We also have economic impact payments.  These will be, within the next three weeks, direct payments into most people’s deposit accounts.  And for those that don’t have it, we will be having the checks in the mail.
Treasury will have additional authorities.  We have $500 billion that we can use to work with the Federal Reserve for emergency programs that will create up to an additional $4 trillion, if needed, to support American business and American workers in an unprecedented way.
And then, finally, the President mentioned $100 billion to hospitals and $150 billion to states that have specific coronavirus expenses, as well as many additional things.
Mr. President, I especially want to thank you and the Vice President.  You are constantly available to us.  We spoke constantly throughout the day.  You gave us guidance and quick decisions on many issues.
And again, I thank everybody for this great bipartisan work.  This is going to be enormous help for the American workers in the American economy.  The President was very determined that Congress would move swiftly to protect hardworking Americans in business in this unprecedented situation.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Steve.  Great job.

5:43 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Been a very busy day.  I want to thank the American people for the incredible sacrifices that they’re making on behalf of our nation.  And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing: avoiding large gatherings and hand washing, and all of the other things that everybody knows they’re supposed to be doing.
Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy.  Been going for a while, but we’ll win.  We’ll win.
I said earlier today that I hope we can do this by Easter.  I think that would be a great thing for our country, and we’re all working very hard to make that a reality.  We’ll be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done.  Easter is a very special day for many reasons.  For me, for a lot of — a lot of our friends, that’s a very special day.  And what a great timeline this would be.  Easter, as our timeline — what a great timeline that would be.
My first priority is always the health and safety of the American people, and we want everyone to understand that we are continuing to evaluate the data.  We’re working with the task force and making decisions based on what is best for the interests of our fantastic country.
In order to defeat the virus, we must continue to be very strong.  Your resilience and spirit has been inspiring to everyone.  Right now, this virus is attacking 149 countries, but everybody looks to us and they’re watching us.
And I’m very proud to be your President — I can tell you that.  There’s tremendous hope as we look forward and we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Stay focused and stay strong.  And my administration and myself will deliver for you as we have in the past.
Let me provide you an update on critical preparations and supplies in our war on the virus.  Through FEMA, the federal government is distributing more than 8 million N95 respirators, 14 million surgical masks, and many, many millions more are under order, and they’ll be arriving soon.  2.4 million face shields, 1.9 million surgical gowns, 13.5 million gloves, and more than 4,000 ventilators to the areas of greatest need have already been sent.  And we have 4,000 being delivered to New York.
The federal government is using every resource at its disposal to acquire and distribute critical medical supplies.  The core element of this strategy is my executive order authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act, which has, as you know, already been activated, actually, a long time ago — quite a long time ago.
Private companies are heeding our call to produce medical equipment and supplies because they know that we will not hesitate to invoke the DPA in order to get them to do what they have to do.  It’s called leverage.  You don’t have to use it from the standpoint of — actually, it’s been activated, but you don’t have to use it.  But the threat of it being there is great leverage.  And companies are doing as we ask, and companies are actually — even better than that, they’re coming through and they’re calling us.  And it’s been, really, something to see.
This morning, Ford, 3M, and General Electric Healthcare are making tremendous numbers — they’ve already started — of respirators ventilators and face shields.  They’re working together.  We didn’t have to exercise or utilize the DPA in any way.  The fact that we have it helps, but we didn’t have to.  And for the most part, we won’t have to.
We’re receiving full cooperation from companies with the understanding that the federal government stands ready to compel cooperation if need be.  We haven’t found that to be the case.
It’s been really amazing to see these big, strong, powerful — in some cases, very small companies, family-owned companies, step up and make a lot of great product for what we’re going through and what we will continue to be going through for a while.
The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard are building four hospital facilities in New York City at the Javits Center, which will be operational very soon.  They’ve already started.
In addition, they’re building four separate medical facilities in different parts of the state.  We’re dealing with Governor Cuomo on that.  So you’re going to have four hospitals and four medical facilities at the highest level, too.  Really incredible facilities.  Temporary but incredible.
We’re also deploying the U.S. Navy hospital ship, and that will be arriving in New York Harbor in the not-too-distant future.  It’s finishing its maintenance.  They’re doing a very big maintenance, and what we did is we condensed it very seriously.  And, as you know, the other hospital ship — and these are incredible ships — it’s already on its way to Los Angeles.
So we’re in frequent contact with state and local officials, and getting a lot of work done.  We’re, likewise, building hospitals in Los Angeles.  We’re working also — the State of Washington.  We’re working with the governor of the State of New Jersey.  We’re building a medical facility, a hospital facility, and doing a lot of work.
I want to thank the people from FEMA — the great people from FEMA — and also the Army Corps of Engineers.
Secretary Mnuchin and the members of my administration continue to work closely with Congress.  I’m pleased to report that we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history.  Senators will soon, hopefully, vote on a $2 trillion bill that will deliver direct cash payments to struggling Americans.  No fault of their own.  This came out of nowhere.  Nobody can imagine this even happened.  But it’s not their fault.
We want to protect, and we will, all of the things that a person needs protected and a family needs protected.  We’re working on job retention, loans for small businesses, and extended unemployment insurance for laid-off workers.
The legislation will also include billions of dollars for additional resources for our, really, heroic — these are incredible doctors, nurses — brave — and hospitals, as well as support for hard-hit industries such as the airline industry and the cruise ship industry, which employ tremendous amounts of people and obviously serve very important functions beyond that.
With very tough protections for the American taxpayer, the loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable and, at the same time, they’ll bridge — they call them bridge loans.  In many cases, they’ll be bridging these companies back into very good health.  Some of them are very important companies that four weeks ago didn’t have a problem.
I’m also confident that the Democrats will do the right thing.  I feel very confident.  They’re working very hard together right now — Republicans and Democrats — and they’re getting very close to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country.
Today, as you probably saw, the Dow surged over 2,100 points.  That’s the all-time record in history of the Exchange.  This is very encouraging.  And I think part of the reason is they are looking at what is close to being passed, and I think a very big part of it is they see that we want to get our country opened as soon as possible.  They see we’re working very hard on that.  That’s a very big factor, I think, in today’s historic gain.
The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America’s economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen our country for business, and we hope that’s going to be very soon.
I want to assure Americans that we have a team of public health experts.  You’ve gotten to know them as well as I know them; they’re great people.  Incredible.  Talented.  They love our country.  Also, economists and other professionals working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right — one based on the best science, the best modeling, and the best medical research there is anywhere on Earth.
Our great people have been — especially when it comes to our public health experts and officials — have been helping other countries, dealing with other countries, constant touch with other countries, helping them out, because many of them have never seen anything like what’s happening.
But our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening.  I’m also hopeful to have Americans working again by that Easter — that beautiful Easter day.  But rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely on the health, safety, and wellbeing of our citizens.
This is a medical crisis; this isn’t a financial crisis. But it’s a thing that nobody has seen for many, many decades. Nothing like this.  Marshaling our economic strength is a key feature of defeating the virus, producing the material supplies and equipment that we need.  And they’re doing a really fantastic job.
We’re helping the governors.  We had a conference call the other day with governors, and we allowed the press to join us in the call.  And the spirit between us and the governors has been really great.
We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival.  I think we’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot.  This crisis has underscored just how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector.
For three years, we’ve embarked on a great national project to secure our immigration system and bring back our manufacturing jobs.  We brought back many jobs — records numbers — record numbers of jobs.
And this really shows — this experience shows how important borders are.  Without borders, you don’t have a nation.
Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospitals, and American equipment for our great American heroes.
Now, both parties must unite to ensure the United States is truly an independent nation in every sense of the word.  Energy independence — we’ve established that.  That’s something incredible that we have established.  We’re energy independent, manufacturing independence, economic independence, and territorial independence enforced by strong, sovereign borders.
America will never be a supplicant nation.  We will be a proud, prosperous, independent, and self-reliant nation.  We will embrace commerce with all, but we will be dependent on none.
Above all, we know that the best thing for our economy and the world right now is a very, very powerful victory over the virus.  Every day, the American people and showing the unity and resolve that has always defined the character of our nation.
In New York, citizens are using 3D printers to make hundreds of the face shields.  They’re making them by the hundreds.  In Texas, businesses and churches are uniting to collect gloves and thermometers for hospitals.
In the selfless actions of our amazing citizens, we’re seeing enduring strength of our magnificent nation, a spirit that can never be broken, and a victorious future that can never be denied.  It never will be denied.
Now, what I’d like to do is, perhaps, ask a person who has really established herself as maybe the world’s great expert on what she does — if I could ask Deborah to come forward and say a few words.  And then I’ll ask Tony to come up and speak, and then our Vice President.  And then we’ll take a few questions, and we’ll do it quickly.  And we’ll probably see you again tomorrow.
So, Deborah, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think those of you who heard at the town hall, we are continuing to accelerate testing at a record rate.  We now have 370,000 tests that have been done.  The majority of those — over 220,000 in the last eight days, which, those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days.
This was made possible because of the HHS team working together, bringing together the strength of the FDA with the CDC, and the leadership of Secretary Azar.  We’re very proud of those numbers, but we know that we have to do more, and we continue to accelerate in testing to ensure that those who need the tests are tested first and have access.
As we talked about yesterday, we’re working on the ability for people to take their own sample.  That does not mean home testing.  That means taking your own sample in the front of your nose with available swabs into normal saline that can be transported to the laboratories.  That will allow and free up all of the drive-throughs to be very sparing on PPE, because you’ll be able to do that with gloves rather than the full PPE outfits.  This will allow for more of that PPE to be dedicated to our hospitals.
I think those of you who are tracking this epidemic closely, like I am, you will begin to see that there is encouraging results coming out of Italy.  We are impressed by the decreases that are seen in mortality, the number of people succumbing to this illness, and the number of new cases.
Our new cases will continue to surge because we’re still working on our backlog, although we will be in touch with the laboratories after this press conference to really find out how many are still in backlog and how many were run in the last 24 hours.  Until we get into a 24-hour cycle, we’re going to have a disproportional number of new cases compared to the actual new cases, and we will let you know when we have reached that equilibrium.
Finally, and I know Dr. Fauci will talk about this further, we remain deeply concerned about New York City and the New York metro area.  About 56 percent of all the cases in the United States are coming out of that metro area, and 60 percent of all the new cases are coming out of the metro New York area, and 31 percent of the people succumbing to this disease.
It means, because they still are at the 31 percent mortality compared to the other regions of the country, that we can have a huge impact if we unite together.  This means, as in all places, they have to be following the presidential guidelines that were put out eight or nine days ago.  And this will be critical.
But to everyone who has left New York over the last few days: Because of the rate of the number of cases, you may have been exposed before you left New York.  And I think, like Governor DeSantis has put out today, everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina, or out to far, far reaches of Long Island.
We are starting to see new cases across Long Island that suggest people have left the city.  So this will be very critical that those individuals do self-quarantine in their homes over these next 14 days to make sure they don’t pass the virus to others, based on the time that they left New York.
So if they already are 4 days out, then it’s just 10 more days.  So I thank you if you help get that message out to others.
Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President and Deb.  I want to just talk very briefly about two or three things.
First, the issue of testing and how that has really changed the complexion of the approach that we’re going to be able to take.  We right — know testing was an issue.  We had many questions of testing in this room for a number of times.  Now that we literally have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of testing out there, there are a few things that we can do with that.
One of the things is that when we make policy about what we’re going to be doing with the rest of the country, particularly those areas that are not hotspots, we need to know what the penetrance of infection is there.  So we need to put a light on those dark spots that we don’t know.  We have to act, policy wise, on data.  And we’re going to be getting more data — a lot more data.
The other thing is that the areas of the country that are not hotspots, that are not going through the terrible ordeal that New York and California and Washington State are going through, they still have a window of significant degree of being able to contain.  In other words, when you test, you find somebody, you isolate them, you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing.
When you have a big outbreak, it’s tough to do anything but mitigation.  We have an opportunity now that we have the availability of testing to do that.  So you’re going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we’re going, particularly because we have the ability to test.
The second thing is, I just want to reiterate what Dr. Birx said about New York.  It’s a very serious situation.  They’ve suffered terribly through no fault of their own.  But what we’re seeing now is that, understandably, people want to get out of New York.  They’re going to Florida.  They’re going to Long Island.  They’re going to different places.
The idea, if you look at the statistics, it’s disturbing.  About one per thousand of these individuals are infected.  That’s about 8 to 10 times more than in other areas, which means when they go to another place, for their own safety, they’ve got to be careful, monitor themselves.  If they get sick, bring it to the attention of a physician.  Get tested.
Also, the idea about self-isolating for two weeks will be very important, because we don’t want that to be another seeding point to the rest of the country, wherever they go.
And then thirdly, just one — one just comment about drugs and the testing of drugs.  You know, you heard yesterday about drugs being out there that physicians, on an off-label way, can prescribe it to give people hope of something that hasn’t been definitively proven to work, but that might have some hope.
I don’t want anybody to forget that simultaneously with our doing that, we’re also doing randomized clinical trials on a number of candidates.  You’ve heard about candidates, but there are others in the pipeline, where we’ll be able to design the study and, over a period of time, particularly since we have so many infections, we’ll be able to determine definitively are these safe and are they effective.  We’re talking about remdesivir, other drugs, immune sera, convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies.  All of these are in the pipeline now, queuing up to be able to go into clinical trial.
So I’ll stop there and (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Tony.  Great job.
Larry, how about just a quick few minutes on how we’re doing over at the Hill, please?
MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.  We’re mak- — we’re gaining great progress on this phase three legislation.  Negotiations continue.  We’ve had continued reports.  I’ve been up there with Secretary Mnuchin.  Secretary Mnuchin continues today with the Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, checking in with the President.  They’re getting closer and closer.  They expect a vote as soon as possible.
I just want to walk through a couple of key points.  This legislation is urgently needed to bolster the economy; provide cash injections and liquidity; and stabilize financial markets to get us through a difficult period — a difficult and challenging period in the economy facing us right now, but also to position us for what I think can be an economic rebound later this year.
We started the year very strong.  And then we got hit by the coronavirus in ways that probably nobody imagined possible.  We’re dealing with that as best we can.
This package will be the single-largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States.  The single-largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States.
Phase two delivered the sick leave for individuals — hourly workers, families, and so forth.
Phase three, a significant package for small businesses.  Loan guarantees will be included.  We’re going to take out expenses and lost revenues.  As the President said, eligibility requires worker retention.  We will maintain the people eligible.  We’ll maintain their payrolls during this crisis period.  And, on top of that, we will have direct deposit checks of roughly $3,000 for a family of four and that will bridge to enhanced, plussed-up unemployment insurance benefits that will essentially take those up to full wages.  This is one, two, three, four.
You know, a strong workforce requires strong business.  You can’t have a job without a business to work for.  And the hope here is that — the companies that were operating very well at beginning of the year when the economy was in good shape, we will help them and their employees get through this tough period so they will come out the other side — let’s say this — later this spring or summer — and will continue their operations.  That’s the key point.
Now, don’t forget there’s income tax deferrals for individuals and corporations without interest and penalties.  There is student loan interest and principle deferrals without any penalties.
And finally, I want to mention, the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Refund.  That will be replenished.  It’s important, because that fund opens the door for Federal Reserve firepower to deal a broad-based way throughout the economy for distressed industries, for small businesses, for financial turbulence.
You’ve already seen the Fed take action.  They intend to take more action.  And in order to get this, we have to replenish the Treasury’s Emergency Fund.  It’s very, very important; not everybody understands that.  That fund, by the way, will be overseen by an oversight board and an inspector general.  It will be completely transparent.
So, the total package here comes to roughly $6 trillion: $2 trillion direct assistance, roughly $4 trillion in Federal Reserve lending power.  Again, it’ll be the largest Main Street financial package in the history the United States.  Liquidity and cash for families, small business, individuals, unemployed, to keep this thing going.
We’re headed for a rough period, but it’s only going to be weeks, we think.  Weeks and months.  It’s not going to be years, that’s for sure.  And hopefully pave the way for continued economic recovery after this crisis departs.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Larry.  I’ve been hearing that voice for so many years — like 30 years or more, maybe.  And it’s a great voice and it’s a great man.  So Larry Kudlow, thank you very much.
MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I want to say that that package — and we went over parts of it, but pretty big parts — it really sets us up to, I think, even supersede where we were a month ago.  I think we can get up there quickly and I think it allows us to supersede.  It allows us to help these great companies that need help, like Boeing, which is — you know, it had a problem and then, on top of that problem, it had the virus come in.  But we’ll be helping Boeing.  We’ll be helping the airlines.  We’ll be helping the cruise lines.  We’ll be doing a lot of things and the money will all come back to us, and it will come back to us in a very strong form.
And before we take some questions, I’d like to ask our great Vice President to say a few words, if you wouldn’t mind.  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met again today.  And on behalf of the President of the United States, everyone on our team, and our state leaders, let me just say: Thank you, America.  People across this country, businesses large and small are responding to the threat of the coronavirus in ways that are deeply inspiring.
Now, people are acting on the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread” and it is making a material difference.  Our experts standing beside us told us that if every American — regardless of whether you’re in an area that’s impacted by an outbreak of the coronavirus or not, if every American would embrace these guidelines, that we could significantly reduce the number of Americans that would contract the coronavirus and protect the most vulnerable.  And as the President reflected earlier, tens of millions of Americans are doing just that and we’re grateful.
The focus of our task force, of course, is to slow the spread, to promote mitigation strategies.  Beyond that, though, the President has us focused on testing and on supplies, and making sure that those that are enduring the symptoms of the coronavirus and those who are ministering to them — our extraordinary healthcare workers — have the support that they need.
In the category of supplies, you just heard Dr. Birx indicate that we’ve made great progress.  We have done more tests in the last eight days than were done in the previous eight weeks.  And it’s because of the public-private partnership that the President forged with commercial labs.
And I would encourage people around the country to remind your family members and friends: If you don’t have symptoms, don’t get a test.  We want to make sure that people who are having symptoms, who have a concern have the ability to be tested and to have those tests processed.
We’re continuing to urge all county hospitals, all labs around the country to report to the CDC all the results of the test, as it’ll give these experts around us the ability to continue to advise the President on best practices.
As I mentioned, we — we all continue to follow the outbreak around the country and the test results.  But as several have mentioned, we’re particularly focused on New York.  The reality is the New York metro area was 60 percent of the new cases in the country.
And specifically, as a lay person, I can tell you that the infection rates are roughly 1 in 1,000 in the New York City metropolitan area, where they are 0.2 percent per 1,000 or 0.1 percent for 1,000 in places like Washington State.
It is the reason why today the White House Coronavirus Task Force is calling on any American — first and foremost, if you’re in the New York City metropolitan area or elsewhere — to take the guidelines that we issued and avoid nonessential travel.  But for anyone in the New York metropolitan area who has traveled, our task force is encouraging you to monitor your temperature, be sensitive to symptoms, and we are asking anyone who has traveled out of the New York City metropolitan area to anywhere else in the country to self-isolate for 14 days.
We have to deal with the New York City metropolitan area as a high-risk area.  And for that reason we’re — we’re taking these steps and ask you for the cooperation of the American people.
Because of the spread in New York City, we will continue to surge resources.  The President has described this.  FEMA is coordinating with New York State for the arrival of the USS Comfort in just a matter of a few short weeks.  Over the next 24 hours, more than 4,000 additional ventilators will be delivered to New York State as well.
New York State has prioritized three alternative medical facilities, and, at the President’s direction, the Army Corps of Engineers is working on plans to build those facilities out.
You’ve heard the President speak about the Javits Center — the addition of 1,000 beds.  And we’ll continue — I want the people of New York City and the Greater New York City area to know that we’re with you.  We’re going to continue to provide resources to support your state and local officials as they confront the spread of the coronavirus in that great city.
On the subject of supplies, we had team meetings today at FEMA, which is working on identifying the critical personal protective equipment and ventilators.  At this point, FEMA informs us today that they are distributing 7.6 million N95 respirator masks, more than 14 million surgical masks, and FEMA has already shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York, 36 pallets of personal protective equipment to the State of Washington.
We’ll be meeting again tonight.  As you know, the President stood FEMA, as the National Response Center, up and they are in the lead for the — the approach to the coronavirus, which is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported.  And we’ll continue to surge those resources and make sure that they’re available.
One last word, if I may: The President reflected on the response that businesses around the country have brought to this moment.  It truly is extraordinary.
Now, the President did initiate the Defense Production Act last week, but as the President has reflected many times, we will use the Defense Production Act if we need it to mandate production of — of critical supplies.  But so far, no one has said no.
And, in fact, we see industry stepping up.  The President mentioned Ford Motor Company working with 3M and GE Health to expand production of medical supplies.  We heard that McDonald’s is now offering curbside delivery to truckers who are unable to use the drive-through to pick up a Big Mac.
And I spoke today, and the President spoke last week, with Tim Cook of Apple.  And, at this moment in time, Apple went to their storehouses and is donating 9 million N95 masks to healthcare facilities at — all across the country and to the National Stockpile.
There is a level of generosity that I know is inspiring to the President and is truly inspiring to all of us who are working on the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
The President has made it clear that he hopes — in weeks, not months — to be able to open up the country.  But let me make one last encouragement to every American: We will get to that day quicker if every American will put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines for our nation: “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  If every American will do this, I have no doubt that we will slow the spread, we will protect our most vulnerable, and we will heal our land.
Thank you, Mr. President.

March 23, 2020
6:11 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem, and we appreciate you being here.  And this is getting to be more and more social distancing, and that’s fine.  That’s the way it should be, and it’s too bad.  We extend our best wishes to the person affected.  And we feel sure that he or she will be better very soon.
And thank you for being here.  America continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus.  I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge.  The hardship will end; it will end soon.  Normal life will return.  And our economy will rebound very, very strongly.  But, right now, in the midst of this great national trial, Americans must remain united in purpose and focused on victory.
To every single American, please know that the sacrifice you’re making at this time is saving lives — many, many lives.  It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world.  They’re amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form.  They’re working closely with us to get rid of it.  We will prevail together.  It’s very important.
From the beginning, we have been working closely with our nation’s best scientists and medical professionals, and we will continue to do so until we have defeated the virus.  Our public health experts, who are terrific, are studying the variation in the disease across the country, and we will be using data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time.
We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the okay — meaning the okay to get going, to get back; let’s go to work.
Our country wasn’t built to be shut down.  This is not a country that was built for this.  It was not built to be shut down.
My administration continues to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on an urgent relief bill for the millions of American workers and small businesses and large businesses that were badly affected by the medical difficulty that we’ve had.
If you had a viable business in January, we are committed to ensuring the same is true in the coming weeks.  In fact, we want to make it even better than it was before, and we’re doing things to help in that regard.
America will again, and soon, be open for business — very soon — a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting.  A lot sooner.  We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.  We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem.
At the end of the 15-day period, we’ll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing.  And essentially, we’re referring to the timing of the opening — essentially, the opening of our country, because we have it pretty well shut down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy.
Two weeks ago, we moved at record speed to pass paid sick leave and paid family medical leave and approve $8 billion, including money for the development of treatments and vaccines.  And we’re doing tremendous work in both — on both fronts.  The vaccines are coming along very quickly.
Now Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written, and avoid playing any more partisan games.  They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics.  And I think that’s happening.  I got a call a little while ago; I guess they’re getting closer.  It should go quickly and must go quickly.  It’s not really a choice.  They don’t have a choice.  They have to make a deal.  This should not be a time for political agendas but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people.
We are going to save American workers, and we’re going to save them quickly.  And we’re going to save our great American companies, both small and large.  This was a medical problem.  We are not going to let it turn into a long-lasting financial problem.  It started out as a purely medical problem, and it’s not going to go beyond that.  We’re just not going to allow that to happen.
Our country was at its strongest financial point.  We’ve never had an economy like we had just a few weeks ago, and then it got hit with something that nobody could have ever thought possible.  And we are fixing it.  We’re fixing it quickly.  And I want to just thank the American people for what they’ve been through and what they’re doing.
Our country will be stronger than ever before, and we fully anticipate that.  And it won’t be that long.
Let me provide you with an update on critical supplies:  FEMA is distributing 8 million N95 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now, focusing on the areas with the greatest need.  We have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the State of Washington.
In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks.  We’re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak, and other personal protective equipment, which we will be distributing to medical hotspots.  We’re focused on some of the hotspots across the nation.
We’re seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas widely shared between the federal health leaders, governors and mayors, the scientific community, and members of the private sector.  Really working together.  Everybody is working together.
I’m pleased to report that clinical trials in New York will begin existing for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus.  At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of chloroquine.  And you can look from any standpoint tomorrow, in New York — we think tomorrow pretty early — the hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination, probably, is looking very, very good.  And it’s going to be distributed.
We have 10,000 units going, and it’ll be distributed tomorrow.  It’ll be available and is now; they already have it.  They’re going to distribute it tomorrow morning to a lot of people in New York City and New York.  We’re studying it very closely, watching it very closely.
You probably saw a couple of articles today came out where a gentleman — they thought he was not going to make it.  He said goodbye to his family.  They had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over.  His family thought he was going to die.  And a number of hours later, he woke up, felt good.  Then he woke up again, and he felt really good.  And he’s in good shape.  And he’s very happy for this particular drug that we got approved in record-setting time.  There’s never been anything even close to it.
And I want to thank the FDA, which has been incredible, and Dr. Hahn — Stephen Hahn — a highly respected man.  But they’re doing everything possible to increase production and available supply of these drugs — not only this drug, but also others that are coming.  Remdesivir is coming from Regeneron.  A couple of others are also under study.
But the one that I’m very excited about right now is the one we just mentioned.  And I think there’s a real chance.  I mean, again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact.  It would be a gift from God if that worked.  That would be a big game changer.  So we’ll see.
But distribution starts tomorrow morning, early, in New York.  And I think a lot of people are going to be — hopefully they’re going to be very happy with the result.  But we’re all going to be watching closely.  It’s something we have to try.  It’s been very, very successful on malaria.  Very, very successful.
And countries with malaria have had a interesting thing happen.  They take this particular drug — it’s a very powerful drug — and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries.  And there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the malaria.  So we’ll see what happens.
I’m also announcing that we’re postponing the deadline for compliance with REAL ID requirements.  At a time when we’re asking Americans to maintain social distancing, we do [not] want to require people to go with their local DMV.  We will be announcing the new deadline very soon.  It’s going to be announced in a very short moment.
Overnight, we successfully brought home 103 American citizens after they had been stranded for 10 days in Brazil, following a cruise.  We want to thank the Brazilian government and their great President.  Most of those returned were senior citizens.  My administration, in cooperation with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and the private sector, coordinated their safe return to the United States.  So thank you to Governor Abbott.  Terrific governor, terrific man.
Earlier today, I signed an executive order invoking presidential authority under Section 4512 of the Defense Production Act to prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies such as hand sanitizers, face masks, and personal protective equipment.
We have a lot of face masks; a lot of equipment is coming in.  And we have some people hoarding, and Attorney General Barr is going to be speaking about that in a second.  We want to prevent price gouging, and critical health and medical resources are going to be protected in every form.
Under this directive, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to designate essential health and medical supplies as scarce.  So he’ll designate certain supplies and medical elements as scarce, and that means it will be a crime to stockpile these items in excessive quantities, which is happening to a relatively small degree, we think, but nevertheless it’s happening.  We can’t let it happen.  And we can’t let them resell them at excessive prices, which some people are doing.
Very simply, we will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit.  So we’re going to be watching that with our great Attorney General very closely.
The Department of Justice will be aggressively prosecuting fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic.  Yesterday, federal prosecutors took action in their first case, shutting down a website selling a totally fake vaccine — if you can believe that one.  As President, I will always fight to protect Americans from being exploited.
Thankfully, all throughout the country, we’re witnessing extraordinary acts of compassion, benevolence, and unity.  Construction companies are donating masks by the hundreds of thousands.  Manufacturing workers are transforming their assembly lines.  Citizens are volunteering to deliver food and medicine to the elderly.  We’re truly seeing America at its best.  We’re really seeing things that people never thought even could happen.  Frankly, we never thought this could happen.  But the way most Americans are working toward getting it solved and just doing what they have to do to make this go away has been incredible.  It’s been incredible.
I want to take a moment to thank the everyday heroes who are making our vast effort against the virus possible.  And thank you to the healthcare workers and the first responders.  These are very brave people.  Thanks also to the hardworking men and women of Federal Express, UPS, the United States Postal Service, and the truckers who are maintaining our supply chains and supply lines.  We thank you very much.  Great job.
We also want to give our regards and thanks to everyone at our grocery stores working the night shift so that shelves can be restocked, and the restaurant workers and delivery drivers keeping our families fed.  So many of these restaurants, it’s incredible — they’re doing service where people come and they pick it up — delivery.  I mean, it’s been incredible what they’ve been doing.  Totally different business than they were in, other than they cook food.  Other than that, it’s like a totally different business.
Most of all, I want to thank the American people for rising to the challenge and showing incredible courage, determination, patience, grace, and grit.  From New York to Seattle and everywhere in between, your acts of selflessness and sacrifice and ingenuity are a powerful testament to the American character.  It’s really being shown.  It’s really showing up at a level that people are really respecting.  All over the world, they’re respecting.  And the world has problems.  We’re at 148 countries now.  A hundred and forty-eight countries are affected by the invisible scourge.
And all of the uplifting reflections of the American spirit are out there for everyone to see.  Together, we will care for our fellow citizens.  And we will win this war, and we’ll win it much sooner than people think.  And we’ll be back in business as a country pretty soon.  You’ll be hearing about that also pretty soon.
Now I’d like to ask Attorney General Bill Barr to say a few words.  And we’ll take questions in a little while.
Thank you.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:  Let me start by thanking you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for your decisive leadership in this unprecedented battle to save American lives.  At the Department of Justice, we’re working hard to protect the health and safety of our personnel, while at the same time keeping our enforcement efforts at full throttle.
So I’d like to thank all of my colleagues and law enforcement, not just those at the federal level, but of all our state and local partners: the police officers, the sheriffs, the deputies who are protecting and serving their communities, often at great risk to themselves.
What I’d like to do here is start with a few remarks about the order that the President mentioned to ensure the availability of critical medical and health supplies from hoarding and price gouging.
On March 18th, the President issued Executive Order 13909 invoking the Defense Production Act with respect to the health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including PPE and ventilators.
We have started to see some evidence of potential hoarding and price gouging.  And so, earlier today, the President signed a second executive order, providing the authority to address, if it becomes necessary, hoarding that threatens the supply of those necessary health and medical resources.
Under Section 102 of the Defense Production Act, the President is authorized to prohibit the hoarding of needed resources by designating those materials as “scarce,” or as materials whose supply would be threatened by persons accumulating excessive amounts.  Once specific materials are so designated, persons are prohibited from accumulating those items in excess of reasonable personal or business needs, or for the purpose of selling them in excess of prevailing market prices.  It is a crime to engage in prohibited activity.
In today’s executive order, the President is delegating to the Secretary of HHS this authority to protect against hoarding by designating these critical items.  Now, no items have been designated yet, and the Department of Justice is going to be working with HHS to identify cases where a hoarding may be impeding the supply of health and medical resources needed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Today, we convened our first task force meeting — a national task force that will be working on the supply chain issues and specifically on the problem of hoarding and price gouging.  And we are designating in each of our 93 United States Attorney’s Offices a lead prosecutor who will be responsible in that district for pursuing these cases.
I will also want to say that we have not waited for this order to be signed.  As we have received evidence recently, we have already initiated investigations of activities that are disrupting the supply chain and suggestive of hoarding.
I want to stress that we’re not talking about consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations.  We’re talking about people hoarding these goods and materials on an industrial scale for the purpose of manipulating the market and ultimately deriving windfall profits.
If you are — have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about.  But if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks — surgical masks — you will be hearing a knock on your door.
So with that, Mr. President, I’ll turn it back to you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Deborah, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  To start, I want to really thank all the ministers of health around the world who have been sending us their data, despite the fight that they’re in themselves, particularly our European colleagues.  They continue to send us, primarily, their mortality data, which is really very critical, because when you’re in the midst of this level of fight — that many of the European countries are — following mortality data will give you the best insight right now on how the epidemic is proceeding in those countries, because they really can’t be testing at the level to really understand the depth and breadth of their new cases.
In the mortality data that has been provided to us, there has been no child under 15 that has succumbed to the virus in Europe.  There was the one 14-year-old in China.  So we still see that there is less severity in children, and so that should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there.
To Generation Z and to my millennial colleagues who have been really at the forefront of many of these responses: Less than 1 percent of all the mortality is less than 50.  And so this is, I think, also a very important point.
That doesn’t mean that individuals won’t have severe disease.  So still 99 percent of all the mortality coming out of Europe, in general, is over 50, and preexisting conditions.  The preexisting condition piece still holds in Italy, with the majority of the mortality having three or more preexisting conditions.
I think this is reassuring to all of us, but it doesn’t change the need to continue to protect the elderly.  And in order to protect the elderly, we all need to continue to do the President’s directives and guidance for the next week of the 15-day challenge.
Finally, I wanted to really close by thanking the laboratory personnel that have been at the frontlines.  Two hundred and fifty thousand tests have been run in the last seven days.  This happened because these large commercial laboratories are doing around-the-clock runs.  And remember, all of them are being exposed to the virus in the same way from the swabs, yet tirelessly they have worked on and on to get those results available.
They are still getting more tests than they can run per day.  That’s because we were primarily expanded into the — what we call the “Roche high-throughput TriCore machine.”  Those results have been getting to the clients, and we’ve asked them to prioritize hospitalized patients.
There was a breakthrough today, and I think you’ll see this from the FDA, in — for all of those of you who are waiting for self-swabbing options, those are going to be available sometime this week, to be able to — individuals do their own tests.
That said, remember, these platforms are keeping up with those who need to be diagnosed in the hospitals and those who come to the emergency room quite ill, so the hospital beds can be freed up for those that don’t have COVID.  So that will be critical that if you don’t need a test and if it doesn’t change your clinical course, do not come in to be tested.  And I think that mortality data that I gave you should be very reassuring to all of you.
Finally, to conclude: New York City.  The New York metro area of New Jersey, New York City, and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to 1 in a 1,000.  This is five times what the other areas are seeing.  There — through the high-throughput lab investigations, we’re finding that 28 percent of the submitted specimens are positive from that area, where it’s less than 8 percent in the rest of the country.
So to all of my friends and colleagues in New York: This is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time.  Clearly the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.  Mike, go ahead.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but we also convened, at the President’s direction, a conference call with the nation’s governors and we focused on efforts at mitigation, at testing and supplies.  We discussed the President’s recent approval of disaster declarations for Washington and California and New York.
But we also assured governors who’ve submitted major disaster declarations that we will be reviewing them in an expeditious manner to ensure the full resources of the federal government are brought to bear.
The President wanted us to make it clear that the federal government will do whatever it takes to support an effort that is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.  We reiterated that to our governors today, listened to them about their specific needs, and, frankly, made it clear to them that while the President has published at Coronavirus.gov the “15 Days To Slow the Spread” for every American — and millions of Americans are addressing these commonsense guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the days ahead — we made it clear to the governors that this President and this administration fully supports decisions that governors are making in communities and states that are particularly impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, and we are grateful for their efforts.
We also spoke to the governors about the importance of the legislation that is currently being negotiated on Capitol Hill and asked them to encourage members of the House and the Senate to move very quickly.  The bill that is currently being negotiated, the President said that he believes will be resolved soon.  And we’re encouraged by it.  It will speed direct payments to families.  The average family of four will receive $3,000 directly.  There’ll be payroll subsidies for small businesses around America to keep people on the payroll while they might be required to stay home; unemployment insurance benefits; assistance to hospitals and major industries.  And we continue to urge the Congress to act and ask the governors to engage their delegations.
On the subject of testing, we reiterated our thanks to states across the country that are rapidly expanding testing at drive-through sites and at community sites.  And as Dr. Birx just reflected, because of the unprecedented public and private partnership that the President initiated with our commercial labs, we stand here today with 313,000 tests having been completed, with the test results delivered to Americans, and still somewhat more than 41,000 have contracted coronavirus.
But this state-run effort is continuing to receive the full support of our team at FEMA and at the U.S. Public Health Service.  We’re deploying personnel, we’re deploying resources, and testing is literally expanding around the country by the hour.
As Dr. Birx also mentioned, the FDA has been in the process of reviewing less invasive methods of testing.  The President and I both reflected on the fact that we have been tested and we’ve been working with the FDA to make it possible for self-collected nasal swabs, where individuals could, at the end of their nasal passage, collect a sample.  And I’m pleased to report that self-collected swabs can now be collected in clinics and at drive-through testing sites.
This will expedite the testing process, of course, but it will also reduce the risk to healthcare providers for exposure to the coronavirus, and it will minimize the drain on personal protective equipment.
With the current test that goes pretty significantly up the nasal passage, people have to wear gear and then change out the gear.  And this new self-administered test will actually not require the drain on personal protective equipment.  And it’s all a part of our effort, as Admiral Polowczyk will discuss in just a few moments, to meet the supply needs that we have across the country but to meet them with efforts at conservation as well.
On the subject of testing, it’s important to remember, as the Old Book says, it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.  And so, if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need to get a coronavirus test.  We encourage every American to adhere to that so that the testing resources are available for people that are symptomatic.
We also will be issuing today, from Health and Human Services, new guidance to direct all commercial labs to prioritize testing for hospitalized patients.  And that guidance is going out tonight.  We also reminded the governors today that all state laboratories, all hospital laboratories are now required by law to report the results of coronavirus tests to the CDC.
On the subject of supplies and our meeting today at FEMA, we received a report of the new Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force.  Rear Admiral John Polowczyk is leading that up at FEMA, and the task force is working to identify medical supplies that exist in the marketplace today, to evaluate the National Stockpile, and also working with industries around the country to produce even more of the critical medical supplies.
And as the President said, businesses across America are stepping up and maybe as never before in our history.  3M, in fact, has diverted 500,000 N95 masks from commercial customers, and they’re being delivered today to New York and Seattle.  Facebook, we would acknowledge, has donated their emergency reserve of over 700,000 N95 masks to healthcare workers.  And these are just a few examples of the generosity of businesses.
We’re also seeing companies step forward to repurpose their manufacturing facilities to create ventilators, to create equipment.  And I know I speak for the President when I say how grateful and proud we are for that.
We also discussed with the governors a real breakthrough on the availability of ventilators.  We called on the governors to serve at all — survey all outpatient surgical centers and hospital operating rooms because surgical ventilators that anesthesiologists use, because of an FDA decision rendered this last weekend, those can be easily converted now to ventilators that can be used for people struggling with severe illness from the coronavirus.
And so we called on our governors, in conversations with state leaders, to survey all of their surgical centers and hospital operating rooms to identify that equipment.  And with the new FDA guidelines, they’ll be able to convert those to help meet the needs of ventilators across the country.
We are now eight da
ys into the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread,” and the American people are rising to the challenge.  We’re doing this.  But in the days that remain between now and the end of the 15 days, we’re going to need every American to take this seriously.  Listen to your state and local health authorities where there may be additional and stronger guidance in areas where the coronavirus spread has been more severe.
But for every American, know that the part that you do, that your family does, and that you do in your community to put into practice these principles of social distancing — using a drive-through at a local restaurant — will make an enormous difference in lowering the trajectory of the coronavirus spreading across our country.
It’s going to take all of us, but with the ongoing cooperation of the American people, with compassion, with the ingenuity of American industry, with dedicated leadership at the state and federal level, I know that we can slow the spread, we can protect our most vulnerable, and we will heal our land.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Admiral, please.
REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  So, I’m Rear Admiral John Polowczyk.  I’m the Supply Chain Task Force lead at FEMA.
My task is to increase the supply of critical medical supplies, which include personal protective equipment and ventilators — items like that.
I just want to take a few moments to explain the organization that we’ve stood up this week, in the last few days, and our approach.  So you have a chart behind me.  I have a focused — two focus leads: one on personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and a focus lead on ventilators.
Operating under four lines of effort — the first line of effort you see is “Preservation.”  And the leaders tonight have talked about that — the ability to make our stuff last longer.
“Acceleration.”  We have a team of people that are searching the globe for personal protective equipment, figuring out where it is, figuring out if we need to buy it or just transport it and get it here faster.
We have a line of effort called “Reallocation.”  We’re working with our industry partners to illuminate the supply chain.  There are many vendors, many distributors, all on a separate system.  Nobody has one sight picture for that supply chain.  We’ve brought our industry partners in.  We’re weaving that together to make better allocation decisions and understand where it is and where it needs to go.
We have a line called “Expansion.”  You’ve heard some of that today.  If those that are wanting to convert plants, those that want to get into the business, we have the tools to help them to go do that.
So, two focus areas right now: PPE and ventilators.  Four lines of effort — working the problem of the task to get more here and increase the supplies.

March 22, 2020
5:55 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Just before we begin, I want to mention we’re working very hard — long — on getting a young group of people out of Peru.  We’ve removed some, and the rest are being removed with the cooperation of the Peruvian government.  And we’re also dealing with Honduras on getting some people out that got caught up.  And we are working on that very well — again, with the Honduran government’s work.  And they’re working with us, so I appreciate that.
We have a couple of other locations that we’ll report to you, and we were able to get a young woman released from a certain area who was being horribly accosted, horribly treated.  And we spoke to General Milley.  General Milley took care of it.  We went in and we got her out.  And we’ll — we’ll report further on that one.  But it’s — that was rough stuff.
I want to thank General Milley.  I want to thank all of the people that were involved and the people that went in to get her.  I want to thank you very much.
As we continue to marshal every resource at America’s disposal in the fight against the Chinese virus, we’re profoundly grateful to our nation’s state and local leaders, doctors, nurses, law enforcement, and first responders who are waging this battle on the ground.
It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines — so important — about social distancing, nonessential travel, and hand washing.  Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American.
I want to just say that Senator Rand Paul — a friend of mine; he’s been a great friend of mine.  He’s been always there when we needed him, when the country needed him.  And, as you know, he just tested positive.  Jose [sic] Díaz-Balart — spoke to him yesterday — tested positive.
And so people are — they’re getting quite close to home, and it’s a terrible thing that’s going on.  The hidden enemy.  I call it the hidden enemy.  And I think they’ll all be fine.  I hope they’re going to be fine.  But I just want to send our regards — and I think I can speak on behalf of our country — to those two great friends of mine.
We’re working urgently with Congress on legislation to support the millions of workers, small businesses, and industries who’ve been hit hard by the virus through no fault of their own.  Our goal is to get relief to Americans as quickly as possible so that families can get by and small businesses can keep workers on the payroll.
This will help our economy, and you will see our economy skyrocket once this is over.  I think it’s going to skyrocket.  It’s a — it’s a pent-up demand.  It’s a built-up demand.  And I guess you really have to say, “Who knows?”  But I think it’s going to be a tremendous day when we win this war — and we will win the war.  We want to win the war with as few — if you look at it — just deaths as possible.  We want to have as few number of deaths as possible.
Today, I’m announcing action to help New York, California, and Washington ensure that the National Guard can effectively respond to this crisis.  The National Guard — these are tremendous people.  They’re fully on alert.  We’ve signed what we had to sign, and it’s been activated.
We’re dealing also with other states.  These states have been hit the hardest.  Actually, pretty much by far, you could say, the hardest.  Everybody can see that.  Just look at the numbers.
And, through FEMA, the federal government will be funding 100 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard units to carry out approved missions to stop the virus while those governors remain in command.  So the governors, locally, are going to be in command, and we’ll be following them and we hope they can do the job, and I think they will.  I spoke with all three of the governors today, and — just a little while ago – and they’re very happy with what we’re going to be doing because we’ll be announcing some other things for those three states and some other states where it’s hit the hardest.
This action will give them maximum flexibility to use the Guard against the virus without having to worry about costs or liability and freeing up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state.
The federal government has deployed hundreds of tons of supplies from our National Stockpile to locations with the greatest need.  In order to assist in those areas, I approved the State of New York’s request for a major disaster declaration — something which Governor Cuomo has been asking for and which I agree.  And we had it done in very rapid fashion.  We approved this on Friday evening, and we are working very, very hard to get all of these things not only signed up but completed and finished and win.
The request from the State of Washington for a major disaster declaration was approved just a little while ago.  It went through the process and we moved it very quickly.  The request from the State of California was just received, and we will have it approved very quickly.  We’ll be working — I told that to Gavin Newsom.  And we are — we’re working on getting that done very quickly; it’ll be done maybe tonight.
We’ve large — we have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way, based on all of this, to those states including: respirators, surgical masks, and gowns, face shields, coveralls, and gloves, with large quantities already delivered to Washington and to New York.
In addition to large quantities of supplies, I’ve also directed FEMA to supply the following: four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the State of Washington.  The governors know.  The supplies en route to California and New York will be delivered within the next 48 hours.
In addition, the Naval Hospital ship, the USNS Mercy — it’s an incredible ship; these two ships are incredible — one on the West Coast; one on the East Coast — will be deployed to Los Angeles to add emergency surge medical capacity.  And they have a tremendous capacity.  They are really something.
I will say that, if you look at some of the things we’ve been doing — and now those numbers have gone up — and just to be a little bit more exacting, we’ve done a presidential approval for request for a major disaster declaration for the State of New York.  Approval of Title 32 National Guard activation for the State of New York.  We’re providing all of this at no cost to the governor.
I spoke with Governor Cuomo.  He’s working hard.  We’re all working hard together.  The relationship has really been amazing.  But it also enables the governor to provide robust National Guard support to the state.  And the 25 percent — we’re going to be waiving that 25 percent cost.  We’re picking up, we’ll be coordinating, and they’ll be doing something with very special people.
Mission assignment of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide support to build out alternate care sites.  They’re doing various alternate care sites, which have now been designated by New York.  Four large federal medical stations of one thousand beds.  These are very complex places, actually, with great equipment and great people.
Strategic National Stockpile order.  And this is as of a number of days ago — so far delivered to New York — and this is the 19th.  We had the N95 respirators — 186,416 delivered.  We’ve delivered 444,078 surgical masks.  Many have been delivered since then.  Face shields — we’ve delivered 84,560 face shields.  Surgical gowns — surgical gowns — 68,944 to New York.  Coveralls — 352.  Gloves — 245,486.  Also, to New York, in terms of what’s been delivered just since then — the numbers are quite large, and we have tremendous numbers of companies also making equipment.
For the State of Washington, we’ve delivered 369,000 N95 respirators, 507,406 surgical masks.  And this is as of about three days ago.  Face shields — 63,788 face shields.  Surgical gowns — 107,850.  Gloves — 240,376.  And we have many, many things pending.  It’s actually not pending; it’s being — they’re being fabricated.  They’re being made.  And they’re moving.  Now, for Washington — so we have four small federal medical stations, 250 beds.  And for Washington — State of Washington — we have three large federal medical stations, 750 beds.  And then you have, as I said, the approval of the Title 32 National Guard.
State of California — again, to be very precise — we’re going to have the approval of the Title 32 National Guard activation.  And we’re providing all of this again, like in New York, at no cost to the governor — meaning to Governor Newsom and the state.  No cost to the state.  It enables the governor to provide robust National Guard support to the state.  So they’re going to have control of the National Guard.  The federal government is sending — these are incredible people that are being sent.
We have eight large federal medical stations with over 2,000 beds, and that’s going to California.  And then Strategic National Stockpile order — we’ve ordered, likewise, hundreds of thousands of different items.  I won’t go into the exact numbers, but the numbers are very substantial.  But we’re having a tremendous additional number sent.
And whatever the states can get, they should be getting.  I say we’re sort of a backup for the states.  And some of the states are doing really well and some don’t do as well.  The ones that don’t do as well need more help, but these are three states that really do need help because they are — they are hit very hard.
And the outpouring from the private sector has also been extraordinary.  I’m pleased to report that Honeywell — great company — has just announced it will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks.  They’re very hard to get.  They’re actually quite complex.  For the U.S. government’s Strategic National Stockpile.  They’ll be immediately then delivered to the various states.
This expansion is already underway, and it’s going to provide a lot of jobs for that state — probably around 500.  The masks will be distributed by the government for the use of the health, safety, and emergency.  And this is for response workers — primarily for response workers.  These are very high-end.
This expansion is in addition to Honeywell’s action to more than double production of its existing personal protective equipment manufacturing plants.  They make a lot of different things and they’re doubling and tripling their production.  They’re going around the clock.
Today, I’m also announcing the launch of a new public-private consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy, and IBM to unleash the power of American supercomputing resources to fight the Chinese virus.  The following leaders from private industries, academia, and government will be contributing, and they’re going to be contributing a lot of different things, but primarily computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccines.  They’ll be working along with NIH and all of the people that are working on this.
But tremendous help from IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy’s national labor — laboratories, the National Science Foundation, and NASA.  They’re all contributing to this effort, and they’re fully in gear.
This afternoon, I also want to update you on the steps we’re taking to protect and serve our country’s 18 million veterans.  These are great people — our amazing veterans.  They’ve shown their eternal loyalty to our nation, and this is the time where they’re in need, and we are going to show our loyalty to them.  We’re being very protective of our veterans.
We’re working on certain hospitals where we may be doing some work — in Louisiana, in particular, and some other states.  Veterans hospitals.  We’re going to be very protective of our veterans.  Some of them are of that very vulnerable age.  And some of them, obviously, are not feeling well.  And some of them are still suffering the wounds of war from many years ago.
Yesterday, I signed vital legislation to ensure that the G.I. Bill will cover distance learning during this emergency.  I also spoke with many of our veteran service organizations, or the VSOs, to describe our unprecedented action.  In February, the Department of Veterans Affairs established 19 emergency operation centers throughout the country.
One of the things that they’ve been trying to get done for many years — you all know this from following me over the last number of years, but we got it done pretty quickly; they’ve been trying to get it done for many, many decades — was Choice.  Veterans Choice and also Veterans Accountability.
Now, if it’s crowded within this — if they can’t get to a doctor — we have great doctors in the VA.  I have to say that.  We have fantastic doctors — as good as they come.  But it’s hard to because of what was bureaucracy, but no longer bureaucracy.  We’ve done a lot of things, in that case, because of Accountability.  When people aren’t doing their jobs or if they’re bad or if they’re sadistic, or if they steal or anything bad happens, we’re now allowed to fire them for — I signed that a year and a half ago.  For many years, you weren’t able to do that.
So the VA is working.  And I was just told by our great leader at the VA, Robert — Robert Wilkie — he said, for the first time, we got the highest marks in the history — highest poll numbers in the history of the Veterans Administration.  It came out a week ago that — that they’re happy.
And, look, one of the reasons that happened — highest in history.  One of the reasons that happened is because of Veterans Choice.  If they have to wait on line, they go and see a private doctor and we pay the bill.  And — and they get better.  They don’t have to wait two weeks and three weeks or two days.  But they get better.  And a lot of times, they waited so long that they would they would have a problem and it would end up being terminal because they couldn’t get the kind of treatment that they deserve.
So, highest poll numbers, highest approval numbers in the history of the VA.  I was just given that information yesterday.
We restricted visitors’ access to 135 veteran community living centers which house nearly 8,000 veterans with chronic medical conditions so that we limit their exposure to the virus.  We want to totally take care of our veterans.  And that’s what we’re doing.
The VA has canceled most elective medical and surgical procedures.  They’re delaying them until after this is gone, after we’ve won.
We began providing lifesaving care to patients who had symptoms across the 171 VA medical centers nationwide.  That’s a big deal.  Under my administration, the VA has also been a leader in expanding telehealth.  Telehealth is becoming a bigger and bigger factor in medicine.
This month, we have taken bold action to cut through the red tape and make telehealth available for millions more Americans during this crisis.  They can speak to a doctor from the safety of their home rather than risk becoming infected or make it a tremendously long trip when, frankly, you’ll speak to a great doctor right from your home.  It’s happening: telehealth.  We’re very much at the forefront of that, too.  We’re very proud of it, and it also takes a big burden off our system.
We continue to accelerate the development of safe and effective vaccines.  We’re also aggressively investigating a number of antiviral therapies and treatments to determine their potential in reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms.
And you know how I feel because how I feel is, on Tuesday, they’re going to be starting it on Tuesday morning and we’re going to have some medications delivered that — we’re going to see if they work.  They certainly are effective in other ways.  And they — they are safe, from the standpoint — is that they’re not — they’re not killing people.  We’re not going to have that.  So, a lot of great things have been happening in that regard.
I just want to finish, and then we’re going to ask a couple of people to say a few words that have been so much in the forefront of this incredible job that we’ve all been given.
But I want to say that I know that this is a challenging time for all Americans.  We’re enduring a great national trial, and we will prove that we can meet the moment.
I want to assure the American people that we’re doing everything we can each day to confront and ultimately defeat this horrible, invisible enemy.  We’re at war.  In a true sense, we’re at war.  And we’re fighting an invisible enemy.  Think of that.
For those of you who are feeling alone and isolated, I want you to know that we are all joined together as one people, eternally linked by our shared national spirit — we love our country — a spirit of courage and love and patriotism.  No American is alone as long as we are united.  And we are united.  We’re very united.  People are saying things now that, three weeks ago, they didn’t talk that way.  We’re very united.
No force is equal to the strength of a uni- — really, a unified America, a united America, an America like we have it right now.
For those worried and afraid, please know: As long as I am your President, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you, and I will not stop until we win.  This will be a great victory.  This is going to be a victory.  And it’s going to be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected.
It’s now attacking — the enemy is attacking 144 countries at this moment.  One hundred and forty-four.  That’s unthinkable.  There’s never been anything like this.  And it’s vicious.  It is vicious.  Some people recover well and some people have a hard time.  We all know that.
But we will be totally victorious.  We will then get our economy up to a level that it was and, in my opinion, beyond — because there will be a pent-up demand.  There is a pent-up demand.  And a lot of — a lot of great things will happen.
But I’m very proud of our country.  I’m very proud.  I’m very proud to be your President.  And it’s just something that’s just — you’re very special people.  So thank you very, very much.
And I’m going to ask, if I might, a combination of — Pete, why don’t start off, okay?  Please.
ADMINISTRATOR GAYNOR:  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
ADMINISTRATOR GAYNOR:  Just a little bit about what we’re doing in Washington, California, and New York.  We understand that the states of Washington, New York, and California are the areas seeing a steady increase in COVID-19 virus cases.
In order to assist with additional needs identified in those areas, the State of New York was approved for a major disaster declaration this morning.  Washington State was also approved earlier today.  California submitted their request, and the President will consider it immediately.
We have medical supplies in route to the states, including respirators, surgical masks, gowns, face shields, coveralls, gloves, with quantities already delivered to both Washington, New York, and California.  And we anticipate additional supplies to be delivered over the next 42 hours to all these states.
Under President Trump’s unprecedented national emergency declaration on March 13, FEMA is assisting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, including reimbursing eligible emergency protective measures taken at the directional guidance of public health officials in response to this emergency.
All 50 states, the District of Columbia, 5 territories, and 2 tribes are working directly with FEMA under the nationwide emergency declaration for COVID-19.  With the assistance of the FEMA regional administrators, who are throughout the country, we are working to address the needs of state and local officials everywhere.
States, tribal, and territorial governments do not need to request separate emergency declarations to receive FEMA assistance under this nationwide declaration.  The emergency declaration does not authorize direct financial assistance available to individuals, such as disaster unemployment assistance or other needs assistance at this time.
Just a note on the USNS Mercy: Based on analysis of potential needs for hospital beds on the West Coast, the decision was made that the USNS hospital ship, Mercy, would have the greatest impact in California.  The Department of Defense has been given direction to dispatch it to Los Angeles immediately.  DOD has advised that the Mercy can get into position within a week or less of today’s order.
Even though there are more cases right now in Washington, the projected needs for beds in California is five times more that of Washington.  The Mercy will be used to take pressure off local hospitals, other medical needs, and not for treating COVID-19 cases.
And finally, a little bit about the National Guard: The federal government continues to take aggressive action and proactive steps to address the COVID-19 threat as we attack the health and safety — or protect the health and safety of the American people.  It remains our top priority.  The National Guard is especially postured and equipped to assist federal, state, and local agencies, while serving the public.
In response to this unprecedented nationwide operation, President Trump has approved Washington, California, and New York National Guard units under Title thirty- — excuse me, Title 32 status for the COVID-19 response.  The President’s action provide the nation’s governors continued command of their National Guard forces, enabling states to use additional resources to meet the missions necessary in the COVID-19 response.
The National Guard is a viable and responsive avenue to provide a much-needed asset that is state-managed and federally supported.  And I want to be clear: This Title 32 activation does not federalize National Guard members.  The National Guard is still under the authority of each governor.  We’re working constantly with the Department of Defense.  And we’ve had a lot of disinformation circling, and I want to make sure it is understood that this is not martial law.  The Department of Defense, by way of a mission assignment, will lead this task.
And then, finally, we continue to respond to hundreds of requests from governors across the country in filling all their critical needs.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Pete, very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Peter.
THE PRESIDENT:  Peter Navarro?
MR. NAVARRO:  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good evening.  What I want to talk briefly about is the Defense Production Act and to give you the overview here.
Using the full power of private enterprise and the full force from the federal government, my job at the White House is to make sure, tactically — working with FEMA and HHS — that the American people, particularly our healthcare professionals, get the gloves, the masks, and all the personal protective equipment they need.
And I can tell you, sir, that since you signed the Defense Production Act, my job has gotten easier, and let me explain why.  The Defense Production Act, in this context, has two primary functions.  One is mobilization of the industrial base — in this case, the public health industrial base — and the other is allocation of resources, both from the supply chain to the manufacturers, and from the manufacturers to the end users, such as the healthcare professionals.
Now, what we’re seeing on a purely voluntary basis — based on the leadership of this administration — we’re seeing the greatest mobilization in the industrial base since World War Two.  And, every day, I’m working with organizations and companies — National Association of Manufacturing, the National Council of Textile Organizations, and so on — in terms of building up, rapidly, our capabilities to get what you need.
Now, let’s think about what mobilization means.  It can mean, for example, repurposing a factory.  So Pernod Ricard called us last week and they had three hurdles they had to deal with.  They called my office.  Had to make a call to Treasury, FDA, and HHS to clear the path.  We got that done that day.  They started their production that day, moving from alcoholic beverages to hand sanitizers.  And, as we speak, a truck is moving towards New York and will arrive there Tuesday to share with the hospitals over 1,000 gallons of sanitizers.  So that would be that would be a repurpose.
A second example would be one that the President offered with Honeywell.  Again, Honeywell called the White House asking for help from the President.  And what they said is, “Look, we want to do this new factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island.”  They called me on a Friday morning.  And by that night, we had a contract in to HHS.  HHS flipped that immediately.  And I had Honeywell moving people and equipment from Massachusetts to that facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island.  And we’re going to have those masks produced within 30 days, moving on the assembly chain.  So my point is: Mobilization is repurposing, building up capabilities.
And the other portion is, of course, the allocation of resources.  Now, what I can tell you so far is that the Defense Production Act, sir, has given me quiet leverage.  When you have a strong leader, you can take a light hand, initially.
And so what we’ve seen with this outpouring of volunteers from private enterprise — we’re getting what we need without — without putting the heavy hand of government down.
There will be, possibly, cases down the road — and the manufacturers have actually asked me and alerted me of this — where some places in the supply chain, they may have problems that the White House will have to break through using the Defense Production Act.  We won’t hesitate to do that.
The last thing I’ll tell you is that I also get a lot of calls that are very disquieting.  Brokers are offering millions of items, whether goggles, masks, or whatever.  And you go through three different brokers, tracing to a warehouse in LA that’s allegedly got 10 million masks and they might charge you seven times what they cost.  That’s price gouging.
We are going to — message to the hoarders: If you got any large quantities of material that this country needs right now, get them to market or get them to us.  We’ll pay you a fair price.  But if you don’t do that, we’re going to come for you and make sure that doesn’t happen in this country.  And that would be a good use of the Defense Production Act.
So I salute you, sir.  You’ve made my job easier, and I appreciate that.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Peter, very much.  Great job.
Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The Task Force met this afternoon, as we do every day.
And let me begin today by simply saying thank you to the American people.  And thank you for the way that people across this country — seven days into “15 Days to Slow the Spread” — that people in communities large and small across America are responding, are cooperating, are communicating not just on behalf of their own health and the health of their family, but more importantly, on behalf of the most vulnerable among us.  So on behalf of your President and our entire task force, just “thank you” to the American people.
I also want to express our appreciation to the governors across the country.  The President today just announced action in New York, California, and Washington State as the latest demonstration that this administration will do whatever it takes to support the leadership at the state and local level as the American people confront the spread of the coronavirus.
The legislative efforts that are underway are being negotiated on Capitol Hill as we speak.  The bipartisan spirit that’s taking place there that’s reflected in all of our interactions with state leaders around the country is a great credit to the nation.  But it should be a great encouragement to the American people that your government at the federal level, at the state level, working with courageous healthcare providers all across America, are coming together to meet this moment.
And that is the way our system works.  It’s extremely important that the American people recognize that one of the things that makes America different is that we have a system of federalism and that the — by putting FEMA in the lead, the President has emphasized that our response to the coronavirus is, in the anthem of FEMA, it is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported.
We want the people on the ground — the decision makers — to have what they need.  We want states to be able to manage the unique circumstances in their states.  And whether it be the legislation moving through the Congress or the efforts the President announced today — major disaster declarations, Title 32 on the National Guard, resources flowing, hospital beds flowing — we’re going to continue to make sure that our states have what they need to meet this moment.
Our task force continues to focus on the priorities the President has given us.  They are testing mitigation and supplies.
And on the subject of testing, as is evident to people across the country, testing is more and more available every single day.  And we’ll be detailing tomorrow, from this podium, the progress that we are making on tests.
At this day’s reporting, 254,000 Americans have been tested and received results in coronavirus tests, with slightly more than 30,000 actually testing positive.  There’s a bit of an encouraging word in that for every American.  Remember, everyone that’s being tested now, with the exception of our healthcare workers, are people that have symptoms that make them think they may have the coronavirus.  And as our numbers come in consistently — because the 254,000 does not include all the local hospitals or all the local labs in our states — it’s working out to be: About 1 in 10 Americans who’ve been tested, who thought they had coronavirus, actually had it; 9 out of 10 did not.
But we’ll continue to roll out the testing to provide that resource to the American people.  And we’re working to make testing happen faster.  We expect word from the commercial labs that we should be caught up on the backlog in testing by the middle of the week.  And we are urging today, on the President’s behalf, that all labs would prioritize in-patient testing.
Let me say again to all of the commercial labs in the country: You will receive guidance from HHS tomorrow.  But on behalf of the President and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we are urging all commercial labs to prioritize in-patient testing.  We want people that have been checked into a hospital, that are being treated for what they suspect to be coronavirus, to receive those tests more quickly.
Also, I’m pleased to report that yesterday the FDA approved an emergency authorization on a new test that should be in production by the end of March.  It actually would be a coronavirus test, the results of which come back in 45 minutes.  And we’re also working — the FDA is working with manufacturers around the country to come up with even faster, more innovative tests.  And as we told our governors in several calls this week, governors and state health officials should simply contact FEMA for the latest information on testing solutions.
Let me also say: Tomorrow, when we gather at this podium, we’ll be unveiling, with Dr. Bob Redfield in the lead, new guidance for people that work in law enforcement, first responders, people that work in what we call “critical infrastructure” in the country.
It was in early March that CDC issued guidance for people that were asymptomatic or did not have symptoms but who had been exposed to someone with coronavirus who gave them guidance about being able to return to work wearing a mask for 14 days.  And tomorrow, at this podium, CDC will unveil, in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security, new guidance, which will make it possible for people that have been exposed to return to work more quickly with — by wearing a mask for a certain period of time.
Let me also amplify a point on behalf of the President and on behalf of the State Department about Americans abroad.  You know, one of the — one of the reasons why the United States is in a different position today than portions of Europe are — and China and elsewhere — is because the President suspended all travel from China.  He suspended travel from Europe and the UK and Ireland.
But the State Department is working around the clock to assist Americans who may find themselves overseas.  They’re able to come home; there’s no barrier to Americans coming back to American soil.  They’re screened, when they come home, through a series of airports.  But we’re aware that, with flights being canceled, some Americans have found themselves unable to find a way home.  And as the President said, we’ve been working very diligently, through the State Department, to make it possible.  Commercial flights have been chartered.  We’re also working with the military for backup on flights.
At this point, the State Department has brought more than 3,000 Americans back home.  But speaking to the Secretary of State today, he wanted me to share a website and a phone number for any American that might be looking on from overseas.  You can call the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program at 1-888-407-4747 or you can go online at STEP.State.gov.  This will allow our embassies and consulates to gather important information about your situation and work to facilitate to bring you home.
Let me say, finally — as I began, let me close — as the chairman or the leader of this White House Coronavirus Task Force: We are 7 days into 15 days, and the American people are responding.  Because as we speak about supplies, as we speak about testing, the most important thing every American can do is heed the guidance and the direction from your state and local officials, particularly in areas where we have widespread coronavirus infections.
But for every American, putting into practice these measures that the President alluded to at the very beginning of his remarks is a way that we can — that we can do this, America; that we can — we can lessen the magnitude of the coronavirus in our country.  With the cooperation, compassion, generosity, and prayers of the American people, we can slow the spread, we can protect the most vulnerable, and we can heal our land.
So let’s do it, America.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mike.
So, just a couple of little things, and we’ll take some questions.  Maybe you will have some, maybe you won’t.  That’ll be a shock.  It would shock the American public.
But I have to say, on the testing, the new — if we — if this works out, and we think it might, the new test will be a very simple one — much easier than the existing test, which is quite complex and not — not a lot of fun to take.  And this will be a game changer.
But remember: We inherited a broken, obsolete system.  It was good for a small number of people, but not good for the millions of people that we’re talking about.  And we’ve made this into a system that, no matter where you go in the world, that’s where they’re going, that’s what they want to do, that’s how they’re going to be doing it should something like this happen again.
So our people have done a fantastic job.  Really, a fantastic job.  And I hope the new test works out.  We’ll know fairly soon, I think, Doctor.  We’re going to be knowing about that fairly soon.  Hopefully, it’ll check out or test out.  And we certainly are looking forward to that.  That will be a very simple test by comparison.  It won’t will be unpleasant at all.
And one other thing: the ships.  So we have the Mercy, and that’s in — it’s going to California, as you know.  That’s in — on the West Coast now.  And you have a sister ship that’s essentially a twin.  They’re incredible.  I mean, they’re incredible ships.
I’ve seen it.  I’ve seen one of them, and they are unbelievable — what they can do and the capacity.  Many operating rooms.  You know, they’re wartime ships.  They’re meant for war.  Many, many operating rooms.  Stainless steel.  These rooms are as good as there is anywhere in the nation, actually.
I spoke with Governor Cuomo.  We had a great conversation today — a number of conversations, actually.  He’s working very hard.  And we are going to be bringing that ship — that’s called the Comfort.  So you have the Mercy and the Comfort.  The Comfort is on the East Coast.  And that ship will be coming over the next three weeks — three or four weeks.  It’s being — it was in the middle of maintenance, and we are moving the maintenance very, very quickly.  And we’re also supplying the ship simultaneously.  It’s actually big supplies going into those ships — big.  And that ship will be coming up here over the next few weeks, and we’ll probably be putting it in New York Harbor.  And we’re making arrangements for that, also, as to where it’s going to be docked.
So you have the Mercy and you have the Comfort.  They’ll be coming up.  The Mercy will start very — very quickly.  It’ll be arriving in Los Angeles pretty soon.  So we look forward to that.
A question?  ABC, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-8/

1:00 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much.  A lot of things going on, and we’re going to be going over to the Hill, and we’re having a lot of meetings.  And, from the financial — this is a medical situation, not a financial situation.  The financial, though, is moving along very nicely.
I want to thank you for being here and update you on the progress we’ve made after a week of extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus.  Governors, mayors, the businesses, charities, and citizens are all working with urgency and speed toward one common goal, which is saving American lives.
We’re in communication with foreign countries.  It’s now at 148 foreign countries.  Can you believe that?  One hundred — you talk about a spread.  You talk about a violent spread.  One hundred and forty-eight countries.  Not even believable.
This has been a week of national action and of great national solidarity.  People are getting along.  We’re getting along with Republicans and Democrats and independents and liberals and conservatives.  And actually, it’s a very nice thing to see.  We’re all one beautiful, big American family, and that’s taking place right now.
Last night, I proved a major disaster declaration for the State of New York.  I worked very closely with Governor Cuomo.  And is the first time in our nation’s history that a President has used the Stafford Act to declare a major disaster in response to a public health crisis.  Never happened before.  I’m considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that.  And I’m working very closely with Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, and others; we may be doing the same thing, depending on their needs, depending on what they’re asking for.
It’s been unprecedented action in New York, and we’ve had a tremendous federal response all over the country.  And I want to thank all the people in the federal government and obviously in the state governments and local governments.  We are working hard.  Everybody is working hard.  And the people standing alongside of me are working very hard, that I can tell you.
We’ve also reached agreements with Canada and Mexico on new travel rules at our northern and southern borders to halt the entry of the Chinese virus while continuing trade and commerce.  And we’ve had very good talks, I’ve — with Prime Minister Trudeau, and today, this morning, with President López Obrador.  And we talked about joint measures that we’re taken to prevent the spread of the virus in our countries and to temporarily suspend nonessential travel.   We had a great conversation this morning — the President of Mexico.  And our close cooperation with Mexico and Canada will keep our people healthy, keep their people healthy, keep everybody safe.
Yesterday, I had a call with 12,000 small businesses — representatives of these businesses.  That’s the engine of our country.  People don’t realize that.  You know, you read all about the big ones, but the — these small businesses, when you add them up together, are really the engine — economic engine of our country.  And I assured them that my administration is doing everything within its very considerable — considerable power, frankly, to support them and their employees.
Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.  Likewise, I had calls during the week with all sorts of representatives and systems, like the hospital system.  We spoke to many of the hospital systems throughout the country — nurses and doctors, representatives representing hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors; airlines and cruise ship companies.
The business roundtable, which was fully attended and it’s all of the top CEOs of our country and beyond, frankly — the businessmen of — really, these a world — world-styled businessmen.  These are businessmen that control the biggest companies in the world.  Many of them have taken hits, and many of them are just, you know, going forward.  They — their businesses have been — have been great.  Some have been very badly affected, some haven’t been affected at all, and, frankly, some are doing very well.  They continue to do very well.
It’s — Walmart, as an example, has been really helpful to us.  Doug McMillon, the head of Walmart — really helpful to us.  And I guess — I assume they’re doing pretty well because people are certainly buying — buying more than even a clip at Christmas, by substantial numbers.  Pretty amazing.  But they’re doing incredibly.  They put on tremendous extra staff.  You don’t have empty shelves.  A lot of things have happened that are very good.
Restaurants, fast food executives, grocery stores, all retailers — literally, all of them — in groups.
And we spoke with the G7 leaders at length, as you know.  You probably know about that.
Spoke to many of the governors.  Spoke almost all of the governors at conference calls and many of the governors individually.
And, very importantly, the religious leaders.  We had a great conversation yesterday — the Vice President and myself — with the religious leaders of — of our country.  Many of the religious leaders.  And we’ve had a number of them, during the course of the last two weeks, actually.  But yesterday, we had a very, very significant call with the religious leaders of our country.
I signed legislation providing American workers with paid sick leave and paid family medical leave at no cost to employers and free testing for those who need it.  The testing is going very well and the Admiral will speak to that, along with Tony.
We’re working quickly to pass additional legislation that will provide massive relief to small businesses and affected industries and give direct payments to our great workers and hardworking American families.  There’s never been anything like we’re doing on the Hill right now.  They’re negotiating — Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer.  They’re all up there — Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi.  They’re all negotiating and everybody is working hard and they want to get to a solution that’s the right solution.  I think we’re getting very close.
We’ve also announced that we’ve moved Tax Day from April 15 to July 15, which is a big deal, giving businesses and individuals extra time to file and pay without interest or penalty.  So we’ve moved the date way back.  And so it’ll be July 15, instead of your traditional April 15.  And, very importantly, you will have a lot of time, but you’re not going to have interest penalties or any kind of penalties by filing at that later date.
HUD announced that foreclosures and evictions are suspended for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days.  And our great head of HUD, who’s with us today, Ben Carson, is going to say a few words in a moment.
The Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing — which is another big deal — requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current school year.  Not fair to do that, so we are waiving that.  I would imagine it’s probably the first time ever that has been waived, but I think it’s only fair to the students and to the parents of the students.
It is also waiving interest and other things that we’re discussing right now on federally held student loans and directed that borrowers be allowed to suspend their student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days.  And we’ll be talking about student loans; going to help the students.  They’re under a great burden right now, so we will be talking about that further.  But we’re — we’re waiving, during this 60-day period, various elements — very important elements — on student loans.  Big subject.
I signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act, as you all know, giving us powerful new authorities to help states, cities, and hospitals procure needed supplies.  There’s been a clear call to action to the private sector, and the call is made right here.  It’s been really pretty amazing what’s happened with the private sector — they are really in sixth gear, I think — which has responded in full force, helping to produce and supply much-needed masks, swabs, sanitizers, ventilators, and everything else.  There’s a move on that’s incredible right now.
And, by way of example, Hanes — everybody knows Hanes; great company, great consumer cotton products company — is retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities in large sections of their plants to produce masks.  And they’re in that process right now.
And, at my direction, the FDA is taking rapid steps to make these items available for medical use right now.  Most excitingly to me is what the FDA has done in order to get, possibly, a very successful number — it’s not just one or two — number of therapeutics: medicines that can help — help people that are already sick, help people not get sick.  And, obviously, you know about the vaccine.  And Tony will discuss that a little bit later, but the vaccine is moving along.
But this is something that, right now — for right now, this is what we really — it’s incredible.  And what the FDA has done and Dr. Stephen Hahn, who is highly respected — came as a — just a highly respected man.  He’s been fantastic.  He’s only been here for a couple of months and he’s — he’s gotten thrown into the swim of it and he’s really standing up.
But the FDA has really moved mountains.  I said it this morning: They’ve moved mountains to get approvals on things that — that maybe work.  We’ll find out very soon.  It won’t take long.
An example of the Pernod Ricard, which is — this is really an example where we’re repurposing alcohol.  They went out and repurposed their alcohol production capabilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, Texas, and West Virginia to make hand sanitizer.  That’s a big difference.  And they’ve been unbelievable.  They really — Pernod Ricard.  Their first delivery will be on Tuesday.  It’s going to go to various states.  They’re going to start, I think, in New York and they’re going to work their way around.  They’re making a tremendous amount of hand sanitizer — at a very high level too, by the way.
We’ve activated the National Response Coordination Center to Level 1.  That’s your highest level.  This is the nerve center of all of our government response to crisis and it’s coordinating very closely with our nation’s governors.  Our nation’s governors — many of you were at the call yesterday with the governors and I think you can see the relationship.  And we’ve had numerous calls with governors, by the way, but the relationships are pretty amazing.  They like — they’re loving what we’re doing and the coordination between the federal government and the governors, states, and even local has been pretty incredible.
FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who is with us, will soon be providing you with an update on the Center’s operations.  And FEMA has been incredible.  We got them involved last week — very much involved — and now they’re involved nationwide.  We’ve dramatically expanded telehealth so Americans can see a doctor without leaving home — something which more and more people are using and now they’re really using it.  And now the ones that are using it are loving it.  And I think we’re going to change the way our country functions, medically and probably in other ways, because of what’s going on right now.  This will reduce the chance of infection and preserve hospital capacity.  So it solves a lot of problems.
Every American has a role to play in defending our nation from this invisible, horrible enemy.  It really is — it’s an invisible enemy.  And we will be successful — very successful — hopefully very much sooner than people would even think.
So we say, “Stay at home and save lives.”  This is a time of shared national sacrifice, but it’s also a time to treasure our loved ones and to take stock of what is most important: our faith, our families, our neighbors, and our great country.  And I want to thank all of the incredible people of our country, the citizens of our country that — what you’ve done and the way you’re responding has just been very special — something that we will never forget, that the history books will never forget.
And we’re going to have a great victory.  We’re going to be celebrating a great victory in the not-too-distant future.  And I just want to thank everybody.
And now I’ll introduce our Vice President, Mike Pence, who’s led the Task Force.  And I will tell you this: He has not slept much.  Maybe a tiny bit, maybe a little bit, but not much.  And he’s done an incredible job.
Mike, thank you.  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, all.  And thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today. We briefed the President on our latest recommendations.  We continue, at the President’s direction, to lead not a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-America approach.
You just heard the President describe one inspiring story after another of the way the American people are responding, the way American businesses are responding, and religious communities across this country.  The American people are coming together.  They’re responding with common sense, compassion, and generosity.
People are heeding the advice of state and local authorities, and tens of millions of Americans are putting into practice the “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  We are — we are officially, Mr. President, 6 days into our 15 days.  And as we look all across this country, while we — we strongly support the decisions that governors in states where we have significant outbreak have taken, we encourage every American to listen to those state and local authorities.
For every American, this is what you can do to make a difference over the next week and a few days to protect your health, protect your family’s health, but most especially slow the spread and the potential for the coronavirus to impact the most vulnerable.
As the President said, we’ve been — we’ve almost been overwhelmed at the outpouring of support from American businesses.  The President spoke yesterday to thousands of small businesses.  We spoke to manufacturers yesterday.  And, in fact, as President indicated, the FDA, in record time, just approved one manufacturer that will be producing millions of surgical masks in a matter of weeks for the American people.
The pastors we spoke to, we — we want to thank all the religious leaders from every community of faith in the country making the hard choice to suspend services, to have online services, even while those ministries are continuing to support food banks and come alongside the most vulnerable.  And, of course, the chorus of prayers that is coming up from communities of faith around the country is making the difference that it always has in the life of this nation.
One thing the President and I promised was to remind people that on the weekends that you’re not in the pews, it’s still a good — it’s still a good idea to — if you can, to go ahead and make that donation.  Because all the ministries are continuing to play a vital role in our communities and we encourage your continued support.
The President and I are grateful that the American people are listening to state and local authorities and putting into practice all of — all of the recommendations in the President’s coronavirus guidelines.
And, as you will hear in just a few moments from Admiral Giroir, testing is expanding rapidly across the United States of America.  State-run drive-throughs are expanding across the country.  And, as you will hear detailed this morning, now more than 195,000 Americans and more who have been symptomatic have been tested.  That number does not include county hospitals or healthcare labs around the nation, some 15,000 in number.
And among the number of the more than 195,000 that have been tested, it’s important to remember that only 19,343, at this moment, have tested positive for the coronavirus.  We want to — we continue to urge state and local health authorities to contact FEMA for all the latest developments and innovations in testing.  But we want to remind Americans, as Dr. Fauci will emphasize in a moment: If you don’t have symptoms, don’t do a test.  It is another way that the American people can make sure that we are preserving the resources that our healthcare workers need to minister and to support those who are dealing with the coronavirus and other illnesses.
In a moment, Pete Gaynor will detail the efforts at FEMA.  Since the President’s National Emergency Declaration, we have FEMA in the lead; stood up the National Response Coordination Center; as the President said; and we are working closely, literally hour by hour, through FEMA, processing requests from states most impacted, like New York, Washington State, and California, and we’ll continue to work very, very closely with those states through their very traditional means of federal emergency management at FEMA.
Secretary Carson will describe decisive actions the President alluded to, to bring foreclosure relief to Americans.  And, on the subject of supplies, in a moment, you will hear of not only the progress that we’re making on testing, but on Monday, we’ll be detailing for the American people the progress that we are making on the President’s strategy of procuring more personal protective equipment and medical supplies, allocating them through the system at FEMA, and continuing to urge conservation by Americans.
In fact, I’m pleased to report to the President today that HHS just placed a — an order for hundreds of millions of N-95 masks that will be being made available to healthcare providers across the country.
On behalf of the President, we do renew our call for Americans to postpone elective medical procedures, including dental services.  And remember, this is another way that you’re going to make sure that medical supplies are available, because, by postponing elective medical procedures, you’re freeing up medical supplies for those dealing with the coronavirus.
As the President mentioned, our team is on Capitol Hill as we speak, working with members of Congress in both political parties.  They’re making progress, by all accounts, on a bipartisan bill.  They worked late into the night last night and started early this morning, and we are working to pass that legislation on Monday in both the House and the Senate.
Now, on a personal note, many of you may have been made aware that a member of my staff has tested positive for the coronavirus.  We learned of that late yesterday.  I am pleased to report that he is doing well.  He had mild, cold-like symptoms for about a day and a half; has not been to the White House since Monday.
Neither the President nor I had direct contact with that staff person.  We worked immediately with the White House physician and the CDC.  We’ve done all contact tracing.  And while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as Vice President and as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon.
Let me say again how grateful the President and I are that every American has acted on the President’s coronavirus guidelines.  We are 6 days into 15 days that, but as Dr. Fauci may well reflect in a moment, it’s an opportunity for us here on the footholds of this epidemic curve in our country to literally lower the impact in our nation and save lives.  Every American can do their part to slow the spread.  And we encourage you each to continue to do that.
As the President says often: Remember we’re all in this together.  And also remember that, for most Americans, the risk of serious illness from the coronavirus remains low.  The reason we want to put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines is because no American would want to inadvertently expose someone who is vulnerable — a senior with a serious underlying health condition — to the coronavirus with a potential threat.
I did hear one story this morning, Mr. President, about a senior named Geneva Wood.  She actually is at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington.  She is not only a grandmother, she is a great, great grandmother.  Ninety years young, and she tested positive for the coronavirus on March 6th.  But by all accounts, she’s doing well and she wanted America to know there is hope.  And her strength and her enthusiasm is truly an inspiration to the nation.
As the President said many times, we’re going to get through this and come out stronger than ever before.  And we’ll get through this as Americans, together.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike.
Admiral, please.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.
As I told you earlier last week, we are in the process and are effectively transitioning to large-scale testing by leveraging all the components of the American healthcare system.  When we started, it was CDC only, then it was the state public health laboratories.  Now we’re transitioning into the mainstream of American testing with many of the companies that the President invited in the Rose Garden just a week ago.
So, currently, 91 public health laboratories, state public health laboratories are up and running in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.
This is our curve, and I want to be very clear about this — that this only accounts for CDC state public health laboratories and the laboratories that are members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association.  These are the main reference laboratories: LabCorp, Quest, Mayo, ARUP, Bio-Reference Labs, and Sonic Healthcare.  It does not account for the well over 10,000 — 15,000 hospital-based labs, many of which are doing testing, for whom we will get data this week to give you an overall rollup.
As you can see, over 195,000 people in America have completed their testing.  That means tests plus results.  This does not count the people whose tests are in process.  And, as you see, this curve is going — it will continue to rise dramatically over the next period of time.
So, again, this is utilizing all the components of the great American healthcare system, the state and local public health laboratories, the hospital system, which is not represented here, and the main reference laboratories.
Now, I do want to make it clear that, although testing is becoming more available, and Dr. Fauci will definitely emphasize this more, there are priorities for testing.  And clearly, everyone across the country should understand that those hospitalized or in an ICU are our priority for testing:  Symptomatic health care workers, for obvious reasons, we want to make sure that they — their health is preserved and that they are not going to spread to those who may be seriously ill;
symptomatic people in long-term care facilities: As the Vice President has highlighted and we’ve said many times, elderly in our society have a much higher mortality rate, much higher serious complication rate; Symptomatic individuals over 65: Symptomatic individuals who have underlying conditions, like chronic heart disease or liver disease or other types of chronic diseases; Patients in public health investigations.  And there are local priorities around the country, particularly healthcare workers for testing.
And Dr. Fauci is going to emphasize this about the types of people who may not need to be tested.  Testing is going well, it’s ramping up, but we should still have priorities.
Finally, I want to talk about the community-based testing sites.  I know they’re popular now because there’s now an acronym, which I’m sure the Vice President doesn’t appreciate: CBTS or CBT sites.  We talked about these earlier in the week and I wanted to emphasize, again, that these are state-managed and locally executed.  The federal government is there to provide support, know how, blueprints on how to do this, but these are really springing up at dozens and dozens of sites all over the country, adapted to the local needs.  Some are drive-throughs, some are walk-up, some are geared to healthcare workers and emergency responders.
So again, what we see in the upcoming week is this curve will continue to increase as testing becomes more widely available, as the great American healthcare industry continues to increase the availability of tests and the throughput of those tests.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Admiral.  Dr. Fauci, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, President, Mr. Vice President.  What I want to do, just over the next minute or so, is maybe connect some of the dots of the things that you’ve heard today.
First, the status of the dynamics of the — of the outbreak.  I mean, you all know the numbers.  You’ve seen them.  We have widespread infection, but to varying degrees throughout the country.
So, for example, when you talk about the kinds of mitigation issues that we have put forth and have emphasized, just as I mentioned the other day, there are two dynamic forces that are going on at the same time.  You’re having the natural course of an outbreak, trying to peak at a high level.  And then you have the mitigation strategies, which are aimed at dampening that.  We’ve mentioned that multiple times.
We often get asked: “How do you know you’re having an effect?”  Because there are two things that are going on at the same time, they may be confounding.  Well, I can tell you for sure, from a public health standpoint and experience with other outbreaks, we know we are clearly having an effect, but we can’t  quantitate it for you accurately now, because, looking forward, you’ll know what the impact of the rate of this steep inclines will be.  So that’s why we’re going to come back to you every day and keep you up to date about that.
Getting — with regard to the disproportionate of the response, everyone — it’s right here.  I’ll get the — open up the Vice President’s book, with his permission.  This is baseline for everyone — in other words, throughout the country.  But then there will be areas — and you’ve heard them: Washington State, California, New York City — in which the dynamics of the outbreak are clearly different and much more robust, if you want to use that word.  And that’s the reason why we’re seeing the mitigation ratcheted up in that regard.  And again, hopefully — and I have confidence it will happen — you will see an impact on that.
Next, getting to testing.  You saw the numbers we’re testing.  Remember, there was always an issue with testing.  I think we’re getting to the solution that everybody in the country is looking for.
But I want to emphasize one thing that Admiral Giroir mentioned — is that not every single person in the United States needs to get tested.  He gave you the priorities; I don’t want to repeat them.  But let me tell you one of the unintended consequences of individuals who don’t need to get tested that flood the desire to get tested.  Currently — and I hope we’ll be able to change it and make it much less reliable on PPEs — when you go in and get tested, you are consuming personal protective equipment — masks and gowns.  Those are high priority for the healthcare workers who are taking care of people who have coronavirus disease.
So what we don’t want to do is to have a situation where we will — we do have disparities in availability of PPEs now and we’re working hard to correct that.  But currently today, we want to make sure that the people who are taking care of people with coronavirus disease do not endanger themselves because they don’t have the personal protective equipment.
And then finally, one last thing — it was just mentioned.  The Surgeon General has been pushing this: Please put off, cancel elective medical and surgical procedures.  You don’t want to not ever do them, but, for the time being, don’t do them because they also not only consume personal protective equipment, they may also consume some of the things like ventilators that you might need.  So let’s pull in this together, and we will get through it, I promise you.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony, very much.  Please.
ADMINISTRATOR GAYNOR:  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  FEMA is now leading the federal operation — or the federal response for all operations on behalf of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, who oversees this whole-of-nation response.
HHS will continue to provide their expert — matter expertise on health.  Pursuant to the nationwide emergency declaration, FEMA, in coordination with HHS, is assisting state, local, tribal, territorial governments and other eligible entities with health and safety emergency protective measures on behalf of the American public.
As of yesterday, 50 states, the District of Columbia, 5 territories, and 1 tribe are working directly with FEMA under the nationwide emergency declaration for COVID-19.  In just 24 hours, we’ve obligated $100 million to states, territories and tribes.
A little bit about supplies: It is of the utmost importance that requests for assistance, especially for critical supplies, get routed through proper channels as soon as possible.  And we ask everyone to follow the normal procedures — the normal procedures FEMA uses in a natural disaster.  There’s no different procedure for the COVID-19 pandemic.
But, remember, you can still order supplies from your regular vendors and buy it on the open market.  Buy it where you can find it.  We will reimburse you.  If you buy medical supplies from foreign sources, it is reimbursable.  “Buy America” does not apply to the Stafford Act, except for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.
If you can’t buy it on the open market, make a request to the FEMA system.  Requests for assistance at the local and county level should first go to states — from states to the regional FEMA offices, and then from those offices right here in D.C., where the National Response Coordination Center is open and running.
We are getting requests for mass PPE swab sets, test site supports, ventilators, hospital-capacity assessments and many more.  And we are in lockstep with HHS to answer these requests, but we will do whatever is necessary to get states, tribes, territories, and others, what they need.
And then, finally, what we are doing here in Washington, D.C. — again, this is a whole-of-government response.  Like all emergency responses, it’s most successful when it is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported.  We can’t say that enough.
On Thursday, our federal partners fully integrated with our National Coordination — Response Coordination Center.  And, additionally, all 10 FEMA regions across the country have been activated.
The FEMA regional administrators will continue to coordinate closely with governors, state emergency managers, state public health officials to determine the type and level of support needed to respond to this dynamic threat.  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Pete.  Appreciate it.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Ben?
THE PRESIDENT:  Ben, please.
SECRETARY CARSON:  Well, thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for your tireless leadership here.  And I also want to thank the fellow Task Force members who have been working around the clock in a very patriotic way to serve their fellow Americans.
You know, part of the American Dream is having a home.  And sometimes people say, “Well, what does housing have to do with health?”  It has everything to do with health, having a safe home.  And that is the reason that the President has authorized the immediate cessation of foreclosure and eviction proceedings for American citizens, single-family forward mortgages, as well as reverse mortgages.  And, as you know, FHFA has also decided to do the same thing for 60 days, and the CFPB is very happy with all of this as well.
And it’s really all about helping our people, recognizing that they’re being severely impacted by the coronavirus.  And we’ve also asked the various servicers of mortgage loans to exercise forbearance for anybody who is having difficulty.  It is important, if you’re having difficulty, to actually contact the people who have made the loan, who established the mortgage because it doesn’t happen automatically.  What does happen automatically is that we cover all 8.5 million people, in terms of the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions.
We want also for the PHAs to protected.  HUD does not have authority to mandate that evictions can’t occur, but we are in contact with all the PHAs across the country, and are petitioning Congress for the power to be able to actually enforce that.  But the fact of the matter is, most of the PHAs are run by people who actually care about other people, so we really haven’t seen much of a problem there.  We haven’t seen much of a problem with forbearance and needing to try to force people to do it because they want to do it.  People are stepping up and saying, “What we can do to be helpful?”
As far as Housing Choice vouchers — Section 8 — is concerned, the April vouchers will be sent out next week and May vouchers are already being worked on.  And we’re also staying in contact with all the stakeholders, the advocates for low-income housing, as well as other stakeholders to make sure that we’re doing things that are most helpful to them.
And additionally, we’ve extended the deadlines for healthcare and multifamily financial reporting requirements.  And that’s for over 20,000 multifamily and healthcare borrowers until April the 30th.  And that provides them with a lot more flexibility to deal with the issues that they’re dealing with.
I also want to thank our FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery; as well as the FHFA Director, Mark Calabria; and Kathy Kraninger, the Director of the CFPB, who’ve all worked tirelessly with us to make this happen.
What we’re trying to do is bridge the gap, recognizing that it’s a lot easier for us to take these measures and for Congress to take the measures that they’re taking so that we don’t destroy a very excellent system and have to start all over again.
So for those who are worried about the money that’s being spent, if you don’t spend the money and deal with this now, it’s going to cost a whole lot more to try to build all this up again.
And, as was mentioned by the President, there’s been a sense of unity that we haven’t seen for a long time in this country, and let’s hope and pray that that unity lasts far beyond this crisis.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well said.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Ben, thank you very much.  A few questions, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-7/

11:50 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I had a very good telephone conversation — extremely good — with Senator Schumer a little while ago.  We’re working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans, likewise, are very much wanting something to happen.  And I think it will.
I spoke with — at length with Mitch McConnell.  And there’s tremendous spirit to get something done, so we’ll see what happens.  But my conversation was very good with Senator Schumer.
I thank you all for joining us, and I’d like to begin by providing an update on what we are doing to minimize the impact of the Chinese virus on our nation’s students.
With many schools closed due to the virus, the Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing requirements, very importantly, for students in elementary through high school for the current year.  They’ve been through a lot.  They’ve been going back and forth; schools open, schools not open.  It’s been all standardized testing.  And, you know, it’s — we’re not going to be enforcing that, so I think you can let people know.  I think probably a lot of the students will be extremely happy; some probably not.  The ones that work hard, maybe not.  But it’s one of those things.  Unfortunate — very unfortunate circumstance.
We’ve also temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans.  They’ll be very happy to hear that.  And I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately.  And today, Secretary DeVos has directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days.  And if we need more, we’ll extend that period of time.  Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instructions.
So we’ve temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans.  That’s a big thing.  That’s going to make a lot of students very happy.  And we have more to come on student loans — more good news for the students — but we’ll do that at a different time.
This morning, the Treasury Department also announced that we’re moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15.  So we’re moving it out to July 15th so that people will have time and people will be able to — hopefully, by that time, we’ll have people getting back to their lives.  Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties.  We’re getting rid of interest and penalties.
However, if you have refunds or credits you would like to claim, you may still file.  In other words, you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS.  Other than that, we’re moving it all the way out to July 15th — no interest, no penalties.  Your new date will be July 15.
Today, our team will also provide an update on our continuing effort to prevent the transmission of virus across America’s borders.  And I watched what’s been happening in California with Governor Newsom and, this morning, with Governor Cuomo, and I applaud them.  They’re taking very strong, bold steps, and I applaud them.  And we’re all working together.  We’re working very closely together, including those two governors.
But I would say, based on the call — the media was there — I think we can say that, with respect to virtually every governor on that call, I think every governor — we had almost all of them, if not all of them — and I would say that you could see for yourselves that the level of respect and esprit de corps working together was extraordinary.  There was nobody angry, nobody upset.  We’re able to help them, and that’s what we’re all about.  We want to help.
We’re doing things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do.  But the relationship with governors and states is, I think, very extraordinary, especially under the circumstances where this just came upon us.
We’re working with Canada and Mexico to prevent the spread of the virus across North America, very closely.  You heard what we did yesterday with Canada.  And Secretary of State Pompeo will be making a statement in a little while having to do with Mexico and the border.  And Chad likewise — Chad Wolf will likewise be making a statement.  This is a joint comprehensive effort in collaboration with our neighbors.
The measure and all of those measures that we’re putting in place will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for a mass global migration that would badly deplete the healthcare resources needed for our people.  And so we are working very closely with Mexico, very, very closely with Canada.  The relationship has never been better.  We’re all working for the same — toward the same goal.
Our nation’s top healthcare officials are extremely concerned about the grave public health consequences of mass uncontrolled cross-border movement.  And that would be mostly — and even beyond — but mostly during this global pandemic.
Every week, our border agents encounter thousands of unscreened, unvetted, and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries.  And we’ve had this problem for decades.  For decades.  You know the story.  But now it’s — with the national emergencies and all of the other things that we’ve declared, we can actually do something about it.  We’re taking a very strong hold of that.  And we have before, but this is now at a level that nobody has ever approached.
In normal times, these massive flows place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large.  Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our healthcare system, and severely damage our national security.  We’re not going to let that happen.
So we have a lot of information, and they’ll be discussing that in a moment.
To confront these public health degrees [dangers], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to exercise its authority under the Title 42 of the U.S. Code to give Customs and Border Protection the tools it needs to prevent the transmission of the virus coming through both the northern and the southern border.  So we’re treating the borders equally — the northern border and the southern border.  It’s being treated — they’re both being treated equally.  A lot of people say that they’re not treated equally.  Well, they are.
As we did with Canada, we’re also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel.  These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.  Furthermore, Mexico is taking action to secure our own southern border and suspend air travel from Europe.  So we’re coordinating very closely the air travel going to Mexico and then trying to come into the United States.
The actions we’re taking together with our North American partners will save countless lives.
At the conclusion of my remarks, Secretary Azar, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Wolf — we’re going to be also taking some questions with Tony and Deborah, who you’ve gotten to know very well — but they’ll be discussing certain things, and I think you’ll find them of great interest.  We’re going to be providing tremendous amounts of detail over the coming days, but a lot of it will be provided right now if you’d like to find out about it.
This has been a week of resolute action, tremendous action.  Tremendous relationships have developed with people that, frankly, didn’t get along.  People that didn’t like each other, they’re now working together and maybe, even in some cases, learning about each other and liking each other.  It’s a nice thing.
I invoked the Defense Production Act, and last night, we put it into gear.  We moved the National Response Coordination Center to the highest level of activist [sic].  I mean, if you — if you take a look at what we did, the level of activation has been increased to a grade one level, which is the highest level.
We’re providing historic support to small businesses and to the states.  The states need support.  Normally they do this themselves, but because of the magnitude of it, the federal government has gotten very much involved in terms of getting the equipment they need.  So we’re helping them.  It’s — it’s a responsibility they have, but we are helping the states a lot.  That’s why the governors, I think in every case, have been impressed and very nice.
We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers.  And I think it’s very important.  So they get paid sick leave at no cost to employers.
We’re accelerating the use of new drug treatments.  We’re advancing legislation to give direct payments to hardworking families.  Throughout our country, Americans from all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy striking our nation.  In times of struggle, we see the true greatness of the American character, and we are seeing that.  A lot of people are talking about it.
We’re at 141 countries, from what they’re telling me, and some of those countries are really working in a unified manner.  And they’re working very unified with us, almost — I could say a good — a good number of them.
Doctors and nurses are working nonstop to heal the sick.  Citizens and churches are delivering meals to the needy.  Truckers are making the long haul to keep shelves stocked.  We’ve been dealing with the big stores and the big chains, Walmart — they’ve been fantastic — and others.  They’ve all been fantastic.  We’ve made it much easier for them to stock.  In terms of travel and travel restrictions, we’re lifting restrictions so they can get their trucks on time.
You’re seeing very few empty shelves, and yet the amount of volume that they are doing is unprecedented because people want to have what they have to have, what they feel they have to have.  And they’re also buying in slightly smaller quantities, which is good — because we’re not going anywhere.  We’re going to be here.  So I want to thank all of those very great companies for working so well.
Americans from every walk of life are coming together.  And thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war, and we are.  We’re winning and we’re going to win this war.  America will triumph and America will rise higher than ever before.  We’ll be stronger than ever before, and we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot about relying on other countries, and I can say that I think in both a very good and a very bad way.  Some good things came out of it and some not so good things came out of it.
So I’d like to move now to invite our team to provide information on the new measures to prevent viral spread at our borders.  And I’ll start by asking Secretary of State Pompeo to speak.  He’s doing a fantastic job.  And like everyone else, he’s been working very, very long and very, very hard.  And he’s doing the other more normal jobs of a great Secretary of State, but he got — he got tied into this like everybody else, and he’s been really doing a fantastic job.
Mike, please.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Mr.  President.  Before I address the efforts that we’ve been engaged in to push back against the Chinese virus, I want to assure the American people that, as President Trump just said, your State Department, your entire national security team is staying focused on the other diplomatic challenges around the world.  Those include reducing risk to America from Afghanistan, holding the Iranian regime accountable for its malign activity.  And our counterterrorism efforts against ISIS remain a priority for our team.
Our number one priority across those mission sets remains the protection of the American people.  The President and our team are very focused on it.
I’ll take this moment, too, to thank my team, the State Department team, who is working long hours all around the world to take care of Americans who are stuck at places around the world.  I’ll talk about that more in just a minute.  You’ve all seen Dr. Birx with me.  State Department officials are doing great work, but I want to — I want to give a shout-out to all of the State Department team, here in Washington and around the world, that are working overtime to help us push back against this pandemic.
Under the President’s leadership this week, we’ve taken two important steps.  First, as President Trump announced on Wednesday, the United States and Canada jointly agreed to restrict all non-essential traffic across our border.  This decision goes into effect tonight at midnight.  The restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days, and they exclude traffic and movement across the border for work or other essential reasons.  We’re grateful to have such an outstanding friend to the north who is committed, as we are, to defeating this virus.
I also want to announce today that the United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across our shared border.  Both our countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus to ensure that commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing.  Here, too, the United States is glad to have a friend who is working side by side us in the fight.  Secretary Wolf will talk a little bit more about the details of how we’re working alongside our partner in Mexico to keep our southern border safe and secure as well.
On another note, yesterday the State Department issued a Level 4 global travel advisory.  This means that all international travel from U.S. citizens should be avoided.  In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who reside in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States unless they’re prepared to remain abroad for an extended time.  If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may well be severely disrupted.
And finally, I want to talk about the disinformation that people are seeing both on Twitter and around the world — some of it coming from government, some of it coming from other individuals.  I just urge everyone, as they’re seeing information — information that at one time suggested somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army, this information about lockdowns that are taking place: Every American indeed, and people all around the world, should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong.
This is a tough fight.  The American people are tougher.  Our diplomatic teams are working around the clock to help them keep safe both home and abroad.  And we’re showing, once again, the global leadership that America has always delivered.  It’s been great to see countries around the world rally behind what President Trump and our team are doing.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you very much.  And we’ll take questions right after this.
Chad Wolf, please.
ACTING SECRETARY WOLF:  Well, let me start off by thanking the President and the Vice President for their continued leadership and commitment for protecting the American people during this crisis.
Early on, the President, again, took unprecedented actions to restrict travel from areas affected with the coronavirus.  And today, DHS has screened over 200,000 individuals coming back from those affected countries.  This has been an immense undertaking but one that the men and women of DHS have successfully accomplished.
Today’s announcement is yet another example of the extraordinary steps the administration is taking to ensure the safety of the American public.  Before I comment on the CDC order that I’m sure Secretary Azar will later elaborate on, let me first address the progress as Secretary Pompeo and others have made with our Canadian and Mexican partners regarding cross-border travel.
As we continue to evaluate common-sense measures that reduce risk and prevent further spread, it only makes sense that we have looked at the measures that our neighbors to the north and south are undertaking.  And so we’ve been working closely with those partners since the earliest days of this virus and the outbreak.  And again, as the President said earlier this week and Secretary Pompeo, we’ve reached an agreement — an agreement with both Canada and Mexico to limit non-essential travel across our land borders.
Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce.  Essential commercial activities will not be impacted.  We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders.
A few examples of essential travel include but certainly are not limited to: individuals traveling for medical purposes, to attend educational institutions, for emergency response, public health services, and individuals engaged in lawful cross-border trade.  As the Secretary said, the agreements with both Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday, March 21st.
Furthermore, we’re also working collaboratively with Canada and Mexico to take decisive joint action regarding individuals seeking entry between our ports of entry.  The CDC order directs the Department to suspend the introduction of all individuals seeking to enter the U.S. without proper travel documentation.  That’s for both the northern and southern border.
The CDC Director has determined that the introduction and spread of the coronavirus and the Department’s Border Patrol stations and detention facilities presents a serious danger to migrants, our frontline agents and officers, and the American people.
So it’s important to note that the Department currently apprehends foreign nationals from over 120 different countries around the world — the vast majority of those having coronavirus cases.  Many of these individuals arrive with little or no identity, travel, or medical documentation, making public health risk determinations all but impossible.
It’s also important to note that the outbreak on our southern border would likely increase the strain on health systems in our border communities, taking away important and lifesaving resources from American citizens.
Tonight — again, at midnight — we will execute the CDC order by immediately returning individuals arriving without documentation to Canada, Mexico, as well as a number of other countries without delay.  So, again, CBP is positioned to execute these measures as we continue to keep our borders secure and safe.
Before I conclude, let me just wrap up by thanking the brave men and women of DHS, specifically CBP, and across the government for the work that they do day in and day out to keep the American people safe from the coronavirus.  The Department has a number of frontline officers that have been — have tested positive, as well as the others who are self-quarantining.  And I am doing everything that I can to protect these patriots as they continue to defend our homeland during this crisis.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Chad.  Really good.  Thank you.  Please, Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Today’s announcement is just the latest in a long line of bold, decisive actions the President has taken to protect Americans from the coronavirus spreading across our borders.
In January, within two weeks of China’s notifying WHO about the virus and with only 45 cases in China, we began screening travelers from Wuhan.  Then, over time, as the outbreak evolved, the President restricted travel from China, Iran, and Europe.  Our health experts say that these measures have been truly effective at slowing the virus’s spread to our shores.
Just think about this: Italy and the United States both saw their first travel-related case of coronavirus around the exact same time, the last week of January.  And yet, we have had precious time to continue our work around vaccines, therapeutics, and other preparations, while Italy has tragically been overwhelmed with critical patients for several weeks now.
The President today is taking action to slow the spread of infectious disease via our border.  Under Section 362 of the Public Health Service Act, the CDC is suspending the entry of certain persons into the United States because of the public health threat that their entry into the United States represents.
This order applies to persons coming from Mexico and Canada who are seeking to enter the country illegally and who would normally be held in a congregate setting like a Customs and Border Protection station.  It does not apply to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
During this pandemic, a number of health challenges arise when illegal immigrants arrive at our northern and southern borders and are taken into immigration custody.  We’re talking about significant numbers of illegal immigrants.  From this past October through February, DHS has processed more than 21,000 inadmissible aliens at the northern border and more than 151,000 inadmissible aliens at the southern border.
CBP facilities were never designed to hold large numbers of people and to protect agents and migrants from infection during a pandemic, nor to treat them for a novel virus if large numbers are infected.  When held at border facilities, these migrants risk spreading the virus to other migrants, to CBP agents and border healthcare workers, and even the United States population as a whole.  In such circumstances, the kind of social distancing measures the CDC and the President have recommended are simply not possible.
On top of that, any resources that we are using to reduce the risk of infection among CBP agents, healthcare workers, and migrants in these facilities are drawing on American — an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic.
That’s why the President and his administration are taking these important steps to keep Americans and our immigration system safe from these health risks as part of our whole-of-government approach to combatting the coronavirus.
Thank you, Mr. President, for the work that you’ve been doing throughout this crisis to slow the spread of the coronavirus and to keep our country safe.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  If I could ask Tony or Deb, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  So we continue to review the data very carefully from around the globe, as I know many of you are.  We continue to see signs that, again, individuals under 20 — 19 and under — may have severe disease, but majority and all have recovered to date.  We still see that same trend.
And, frankly, from Italy, we’re seeing another concerning trend: that the mortality in males seems to be twice in every age group of females.  This should alert all of us to continue our vigilance to protect our Americans that are in nursing homes.
This requires all of the community.  And when you see the sacrifices that many Americans have made — the sacrifices that the service industry has made to close their restaurants, close their bars, and so that the spread is discontinued — and then you really understand how all of Americans must make the same sacrifice.
We continue to ask you to follow the presidential guidelines of no groups coming together of more than 10; that, if anyone in the household is sick, that everyone quarantines in the household together; and that we continue to focus on those who have the most vulnerability to this illness.
Now, to the moms and dads out there that have children with immunodeficiencies or other medical conditions: We don’t know the level of risk.  And I know you will also protect them in the same way.  There just is not enough numbers at this time to really tell them if they’re at additional risk or not in the same way that adults are.
I don’t have any new data.  I can see the look on your face as saying, “Is she seeing something new?”  I don’t have any new data, but I think it’s important for us to be as honest with the American people as we can.  And when we don’t have data, be very clear that we don’t know.
Finally, no one is immune.  I sometimes hear people on radio or others talking about, “I’m immune to the virus.”  We don’t know if the contagion levels are difference in age groups, but we know it’s highly contagious to everyone.
Do not interpret mild or moderate disease as lack of contagion, or that you’re immune.  You just happen to have a better immune system and the ability to fight the virus in a way that maybe older people or people with existing medical conditions can’t.
And that’s why it’s very important at this moment, that all of you carry that message about the sacrifices that many have made, particularly our service providers and our frontline healthcare workers.  They are making that sacrifice every day so that every American can move through this well.  But we need every American following the presidential guidelines.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Tony, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I just want to underscore a couple of things that I’ve said a few times to this group.  You may recall that just a week ago or so I said the two pillars, the two elements of our capability to contain the infection and the surge of infections in this country rely on two things: keeping infections from coming from without in.  We’ve been very successful in doing that with China and with Europe.  Now we have the northern and southern border issues.  There’s a fundamental public health reason for doing that, because we cannot be preventing people from coming in from one area when they can actually go into the other.  So that’s an important reason.  Understand that there’s a public health reason for doing that.
The second thing — and I think it’s really important — is what happened in New York today, where Governor Cuomo mentioned about an hour ago some rather strong issues that have been addressed with his recommendations — not recommendations; essentially, orders.
Now, we have a group of recommendations and guidelines that are applicable to the entire country.  You know them; we’ve been over them.  Yet there are places, regions, states, cities in this country that are being stressed much, much more than the country as a whole.  Clearly, one of them was Washington; another one was California.  Governor Newsom made some very important, difficult decisions.  Today, Governor Cuomo did the same thing.  And I want to say I strongly support what he’s doing.
And one thing, as a New Yorker myself — for those of you who haven’t figured out from my accent that I’m from New York — as a New Yorker, I know what New Yorkers can do.  We’re tough.  I was in New York City on September 11, 2001, and I know what the New Yorkers can do.  So please cooperate with your governor, cooperate with your mayor.  It’s very important.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony.  Mike?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning and we continue, at the President’s direction, to bring the full resources, not just of the federal government, but in full partnership with our state governments, businesses around America, and a partnership with the American people to respond to the threat of the coronavirus.
And I know I can speak on behalf of the President with confidence when I say how inspired we are by the way the American people and American businesses are coming together to help defeat this virus in our country.  Millions of Americans are putting into practice the President’s 15-day guidelines, and we encourage everyone, even those that are not in areas with significant outbreak, to review these guidelines over the next week and more, and put them into practice.  And you’ll continue to do your part.
Later today, we’ll be talking with manufacturers around the country.  And the President I continue to be inspired by the way American industry is stepping forward.  We have businesses around the country that are literally volunteering to retrofit plants to help us meet the needs of our healthcare workers and our healthcare system in confronting the coronavirus.
As the President mentioned yesterday, following his decision to put FEMA in the lead — the emergency declaration — we actually met with all the nation’s governors from the FEMA National Response Coordination Center.  The President and I, our entire team at the federal level, couldn’t be more grateful for the efforts of all of our governors in implementing the guidance that is being issued not only from our task force, but also in taking strong measures in their own communities to protect their citizens.
We want to urge every American to heed your local authorities.  Listen to their guidance.  And also do your part to slow the spread.
We reiterated to all of the governors that the President, by putting FEMA in the lead, will continue to implement a plan that is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported that puts the health of America first.
We have received a report today, as the President mentioned, on our legislative team on Capitol Hill.  We’re working with Republicans and Democrats at this very hour to pass an economic recovery package that the President described.  And we hope to see the Congress act on that early next week.
On the subject of supplies, we continue to make steady progress on testing.  Thanks to the President’s involvement of commercial labs, the public and private partnership, more and more Americans are being tested every single day.
And tomorrow, Admiral Giroir and FEMA will update the American public on the status of testing and our support of state-based testing efforts that are literally expanding by the hour.
On the subject of medical supplies, we continue, at the President’s direction, to pursue every means to expand the supply of personal protective equipment for the extraordinary and courageous healthcare workers that are ministering to the needs of people impacted by the coronavirus.  We have a policy of procuring, allocating, as well as conserving the resources that we have in our system.
And now that the President worked with the Congress to make industrial masks fully available for hospitals to be able to purchase, to be able to use as protective equipment, we’re more encouraged than ever about the availability of those important N95 masks to our healthcare facilities.
And over this weekend, we’ll be announcing a major procurement from the federal government of N95 masks, as well.
We’re also encouraged that we’re finding new alternatives to increase the supply of ventilators.  We’ve mentioned that we have a federal stockpile, some 20,000 ventilators on standby, but that doesn’t count the tens of thousands of ventilators that are in our healthcare system around the country.
But the President has challenged us to work to free up other ventilators from other sources around the country.  And there are two different ways that we’re doing that.  Number one, in our recent discussion with anesthesiologists, we’ve literally identified tens of thousands of existing ventilators that can be retrofitted and converted to be ventilators for people struggling with the coronavirus.
But also, on the President’s behalf and on behalf of all of our task force, we want to continue to urge every American and every American hospital and healthcare facility to postpone any elective medical procedures.  This will free up bed space, free up hospital capacity for people that are struggling with the coronavirus, and it will also free up equipment that our healthcare workers need.
It is inspiring that we continue to receive reports that businesses around America are donating N95 masks to their local hospitals.  Businesses large and small are donating hundreds, in some cases millions, of N95 masks.  And I know — I know how grateful the President is and we all are.
And let me close by saying, as all of our experts have said many times, while the threat of serious illness to the average American from the coronavirus remains low, every American can do your part to reduce the burden on your health, on your family, the burden on our healthcare system and especially the threat to the most vulnerable among us by putting into practice the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”
And as the President said at the outset of his remarks, I know that millions of Americans are doing that just now.  And the greatness of the American character is shining forth.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you very much.
Okay, thank you.  Go ahead.  Kaitlan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-c-oronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

11:31 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much.  I think this is going to be a very important conference and I’ll get to that toward the middle, but I have a few things to report.  And I want to thank you all for being here.
And I have to say, I think with social distancing that the media has been much nicer.  I don’t know what it is — all these empty — these in-between chairs.  We probably shouldn’t have anybody sitting behind you either.  You know, you should probably go back.  But I love it.  It’s so much nicer.  But I shouldn’t say that because you’ll get me now.
Thank you all for being here.  And we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus.  Before I begin, I want to start by announcing that today we are bringing home another American citizen.  It was a big thing.  Very big.  Amer Fakhoury is on his way back to the United States after being imprisoned in Lebanon since September of 2019.  He’s battling late-stage cancer.  Mr. Fakhoury will now be able to receive the much-needed care and treatment in the United States.  We’ve been working very hard to get him freed and he’s finally able to have his entire family at his side.
So I’m very grateful to the Lebanese government.  They worked with us.  And we are very proud of his family.  They stood by him so strongly, and they are thrilled.
The United States has no higher priority than the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.  We’ve gotten a tremendous number of hostages out, as you know.  I think we’re 42-and-0.  And Robert O’Brien, as you know, was our chief negotiator for a large part of it.  In fact, did so well that now we have him in a different position.
So I want to thank and congratulate Robert and his team and I want to let everyone know that recovering Americans held captive and imprisoned abroad continues to be a top priority for my administration.
We have one young gentleman, Austin Tice, and we’re working very hard with Syria to get him out.  We hope the Syrian government will do that.  We are counting on them to do that.  We’ve written a letter just recently, but he’s been there for a long time and was captured long ago.  Austin Tice.  His mother is probably watching and she’s a great lady.  And we’re doing the best we can.  So, Syria, please work with us.  And we would appreciate you letting him out.
If you think about what we’ve done, we’ve gotten rid of the ISIS caliphate in Syria.  We’ve done a lot for Syria.  We have to see if they’re going to do this.  So, it would be very much appreciated if they would let Austin Tice out immediately.
As you know, my administration is working every day to protect American people and the American economy from the virus.  Yesterday, I signed into law a critical support for American workers, families, and small businesses.  It was a big thing.  We’re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus and more help is on the way as we speak.
Our entire team, headed by Secretary Mnuchin, is on the Hill.  We’re working with Democrats and Republicans and there’s a lot of goodwill going on.  This was something that happened that was, some people would say, an act of God.  I don’t view it as an act of God; I would view it as is something that just surprised the whole world.  And if people would have known about it, it could have stopped — been stopped in place.  It could have been stopped right where it came from — China — if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it.
But now the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible — with this horrible virus and it’s too bad.  It’s too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago.
But we’ll be back and I actually think we’ll be back stronger than ever before because we learned a lot during this period of time.
I also just invoked the Defense Production Act to help facilitate distribution of essential supplies if necessary.  We’re working with Congress to provide major additional relief to the workers, small businesses, and the hardest-hit industries.  We want to make sure that everybody is able to continue on so that when we recover, all of these companies and these great businesses — both very, very small and very, very large — are not going to be broken up and you’d have to put them back together.  That would take a long time.
Because we really believe in — I believe in the V curve.  I believe it’s going to go.  When this is — when this is defeated — this hidden scourge is defeated — I think we’re going to go up very rapidly — our economy — and get back to where it was and beyond.
Today, I want to share with you exciting progress that the FDA is making with the private sector as we slash red tape like nobody has ever done it before.  Somebody was on yesterday, on one of the networks, and said that there’s never been a President even close that’s been able to do what I’ve done in slashing all of the red tape and everything to get very important things to the market — medical.
So we slashed red tape to develop vaccines and therapies as fast as it can possibly be done — long before anybody else was even thinking about doing this.  And, as you know, earlier this week, we began the first clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for the virus, and that was launched in record time.  It was just a few weeks.  And that would have taken years to do, not so long ago.
As we race to develop a vaccine, we’re also pursuing antiviral therapies.  And that’s what, really, we’re going to be talking to you about today.  That’s the purpose of being up here today.  And, to me, that’s even more important.  The vaccine, by its nature, you have to have long tests because you have to make sure what goes into somebody’s body is not going to do destruction, do bad things.  So you need long tests.
And they’re doing great with the vaccines, but it’s still a long process.  But the therapies are something we can move on much faster, potentially, and the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms — to make people better.  Essentially, we’re looking at things to make people better or, at the very earliest stages, they wouldn’t even know they had it.  And that’s where I believe it’s going to work even the best.
The FDA Commissioner — Stephen Hahn, who is with us — he’s fantastic.  And he has been working 24 hours a day.  He’s been — he’s worked like, probably as hard or harder than anybody in this — in the group, other than maybe Mike Pence or me.  And what the FDA is doing is incredible.  They’ve done things in times that were not even thinkable and I’ve directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and, I mean, fast.
And we have to remove every barrier.  There are a lot of barriers that were unnecessary.  And they’ve done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments.  And we think we have some good answers.  We’ll find out very, very soon.
Clinical trials are already underway for many new therapies and we’re working on scaling these to allow many more Americans to access different drugs that have shown really good promise.  We’ve had some un- — really good promise.  We will do so in a way that lets us continue to collect good data, to know which medicines are safe and which medicines are working the best.  We have a couple that we’re — we’re in really good shape on.  And that’s for immediate delivery — immediate — like as fast as we can get it.
The FDA has also approved compassionate use for a significant number of patients.  You know what that means.  We’re also reviewing drugs that are approved abroad or drugs approved here for other uses.
And, you know, one of the things that I’m most proud of that I got was Right to Try.  That’s where somebody who’s ill, somebody who’s very sick — terminally ill, usually.  In past administrations — we signed this a year and a half ago — you wouldn’t be able to even think about getting any of the drugs that may be showing great promise.  Now — and they’ve been trying for many decades to get this approved and it sounds simple, but it’s not because there’s liability involved and lots of other things.  And I was able to get it approved, working with Congress.  Right to Try.
This is beyond Right to Try.  What we’re talking about today is beyond Right to Try.  Right to Try has been, by the way, a tremendous success.  People are living now that had no chance of living, where we take treatments that would — things that — that would have to go through years of a process.  And if somebody was terminally ill — and I would say, “Why wouldn’t they be able to try this?”  They’d go to Asia, they’d go to Europe, they’d go all over the world to try and find something.  Or some people, if they had no money, would go home to die.  They’d go home to die; they had no hope.
Right to Try has been an incredible success.  But this is beyond Right to Try.  If treatments known to be safe in Europe, Japan, or other nations are effective against the virus, we’ll use that information to protect the health and safety of American people.  Nothing will stand in our way as we pursue any avenue to find what best works against this horrible virus.
Now, a drug called chloroquine — and some people would add to it “hydroxy-.”  Hydroxychloroquine.  So chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.  Now, this is a common malaria drug.  It is also a drug used for strong arthritis.  If somebody has pretty serious arthritis, also uses this in a somewhat different form.  But it is known as a malaria drug, and it’s been around for a long time and it’s very powerful.  But the nice part is, it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it — if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.
When you go with a brand-new drug, you don’t know that that’s going to happen.  You have to see and you have to go — long test.  But this has been used in different forms — very powerful drug — in different forms.  And it’s shown very encouraging — very, very encouraging early results.  And we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.  And that’s where the FDA has been so great.  They — they’ve gone through the approval process; it’s been approved.  And they did it — they took it down from many, many months to immediate.  So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states.
I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it at great length last night, and he wants to be right on — on the — he wants to be first on line.  And so I think that’s a tremendous — there’s tremendous promise, based on the results and other tests.  There’s tremendous promise.  And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it’s — it was approved very, very quickly and it’s now approved, by prescription.  Individual states will handle it.  They can handle it.  Doctors will handle it.  And I think it’s going to be — I think it’s going to be great.
Then we’re quickly studying this drug, and while we’re continuing to study it — but the studying is going to be also done in — as it’s given out to large groups of people, perhaps in New York and other places.  We’ll study it there.
There are promising therapies produced by Gilead, and that’s remdesivir.  Remdesivir.  And that’s a drug used for other purposes that’s been out and has had very good results for other purposes, but it seems to have a very good result, having to do with this virus.  And that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA.
And I can’t tell you how much we appreciate what the FDA — these people are incredible patriots.  And the job that Stephen Hahn is doing — Dr. Hahn, who is one of the most respected doctors in the country, by the way, where we took him.  I said, “You sure you want to do this?”  Now, we didn’t know that this was going to be in the playlist, what happened here, but he really has stepped up to the plate, wherever you are.  Where is he?  You really have.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d shake his hand, but I’m not supposed to do that.  I’d get in a lot of trouble if I did that.  But he’s been fantastic.  And I thank you, Doctor.  He’s going to speak right after I’m finished.
So, Regeneron, again, and — is some — is a company that’s done fantastically well, as I understand, with Ebola and some other things.  Great company.  And they’re looking at some very promising events also.  So you have remdesivir and you have chloroquine and hydro- — hydroxychloroquine.  So those are two that are out now, essentially approved for prescribed use.
And I think it’s going to be very exciting.  I think it could be a game changer and maybe not.  And maybe not.  But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer.  Very powerful.  They’re very powerful.
So I want every American to know that we’re doing everything we can.  And these actions are important next steps.  I mean, for the FDA to act the way they acted, with this kind of speed, is an incredible thing.  Normally, they would say, “Well, we could have it by next year” or “We could have it by — in two years from now.”  You understand.  This is the way — normally, it’s like years and years and years.  They had it immediately, based on the fact that it’s been used for other things — totally unrelated things.
We believe these therapeutics and others under evaluation right now will be able to provide relief to many Americans.  We really hope that’s going to be.  This could be a tremendous breakthrough.  Tremendous breakthrough.  And we will work toward a much-needed vaccine in the future, as I said.  And what we’re doing with the FDA is so exciting in so many other fields.  So many things are happening.  It’s a very exciting time for — for medicine.
And we appreciate that the American public has pulled together.  They’re really staying home.  And I think there’s tremendous spirit in this country right now, a spirit like a lot of people have not seen.  People have not seen anything like it for a long time.  And that means Democrat, Republican.  They’re pulling together.  I hope everything is going good on the Hill.  Maybe I shouldn’t say this until I check out what’s going on, because you never know.  But — but I think there’s a great spirit where the Democrats and the Republicans and everybody else, they’re getting together and they’re trying to get things done.
But most importantly, the American public has been incredible.  We took the best economy we’ve ever had and we said “Stop.  You can’t work.  You have to stay home.”  You know, there’s never been a case like this.  Normally, you pay a lot of money to get things going.  Here’s a case we’re paying a lot of money to stop things because we don’t want people to be together so that this virus doesn’t continue onward.  So there’s never been anything like this in history.  There’s never been a –nobody has ever seen anything like this.
But we’re doing the right thing.  We have to get rid — I mean, our big war is not a — it’s not a financial war.  It’s a war — it’s a medical war.  And we have to win this war.  It’s very important.
With that, I’d like to just introduce Dr. Stephen Hahn.  And he — again, I’d like to send back with Stephen our thanks to all of the people working in the FDA who are fantastic, talented people.  We appreciate it very much, everything you’ve done, especially the speed that you got these two elements, these two very important drugs passed.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Stephen.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to thank you for your leadership during this coronavirus outbreak, and thank you for the kind words about the FDA staff.
We have 10,000 scientists, doctors, and others, and more than that working around the clock to aid the American people in this fight against the coronavirus.  And those words are very much appreciated, sir.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
DR. HAHN:  So, before the President nominated me and I was confirmed as Commissioner for Food and Drugs, I was a cancer doctor.  And I’ve sat across from countless number of patients and had to talk to them about their diagnosis and their treatment.  And one thing that was really important is to provide hope.  I have great hope for how we’re going to come out of this situation.
What’s also important is not to provide false hope, but to provide hope.  And, as a doctor, that’s the way I come to this.  I’m speaking now to the American people as Commissioner of Food and Drugs, but that part of me has not left.  Just look at the way the American people have responded to our calls for mitigation, for social distancing.  The American people have great resiliency, and I’m so incredibly proud of how the American people have responded.
As the President mentioned, he asked us to be aggressive, to break down barriers to innovation, and to accelerate the development of lifesaving treatments.  And we’re doing that at the FDA.
The FDA is committed to continuing to provide regulatory flexibility and guidance, but let me make one thing clear: FDA’s responsibility to the American people is to ensure that products are safe and effective and that we are continuing to do that.
Our folks — and they’re tremendous professionals — are working day and night to do this.  You just can’t even imagine how much they’re working to provide this support for the American people and I thank them.
Since early January, long before the first domestic case, FDA began working in collaboration with CDC.  I also want to note that we stood up an incident command group and had been focused on the coronavirus since the very beginning of this public health emergency.  This is, in addition, an all-of-government and all-of-America approach and I’ll describe what I mean by that, in terms of the development of therapeutics.
An important part of that work is expanding the potential therapeutic options associated with coronavirus, and we’ve learned from our colleagues across the globe about this.  But I want to focus on one thing: I was a cancer researcher before all this, and one thing I know about this great country of ours is that we have unbelievable innovators.  We have people who, every day, it’s their job to develop treatments for all sorts of diseases.  We are incredibly blessed, as a country, to have this.
And as is true in any illness, these great American innovators — academia, private sector — they have engaged us about the best possible treatment options.  We are looking at everything that’s coming across our desks as possible treatment options for coronavirus, and we’re extremely encouraged by the interest and the promise that we’ve seen from these great American innovators.
Now, again, we need to look at it.  We need the data, we need the information to make the absolute best decisions for the American people.  But I want to assure you, we have over 17,000 people at FDA who are doing this every day.
We need — we need to make sure that these — this sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time.  As an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage form right now, and that may do more harm than good.  Those are the things that that’s our job to look at.  And that’s why it’s really important we have these dedicated professionals looking at these aspects of therapeutic development.
At the same time, we’re also working through different mechanisms to actually get drugs into the hands of providers and patients.
The President mentioned this, but one of the mechanisms is called compassionate use.  Let me just tell you about this.  If there’s an experimental drug that’s potentially available, a doctor could ask for that drug to be used in a patient.  We have criteria for that and very speedy approval for that.  The important thing about compassionate use — and that’s what the President meant, “This is even beyond Right to Try” — is that we get to collect the information about that.  Because one of the things that I’ll promise the American people is we will collect the data and then make the absolute right decisions based upon those data about the safety and efficacy of the treatments.
We are working expeditiously, and we are working to make sure that these products are as safe and effective as they possibly can be.  Let me tell you about a few things that we’re currently working on.  And this is a plan that was developed with many of the people at this table, our infectious disease experts on the task force.
In the short term, we’re looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications.  So they’re already approved, as the President said, for other diseases.  As an example, many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug, chloroquine, which is an anti-malarial drug.  It’s already approved, as the President said, for the treatment of malaria, as well as an arthritis condition.  That’s a drug that the President has directed us to take a closer look at, as to whether an expanded-use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients.  And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and — asked and answered.
Let me give you another example: There’s a cross-agency effort about something called convalescent plasma.  This is a pretty exciting area.  And again, this is something that we have given assistance to other countries with as this crisis has developed.  So FDA has been working for some time on this.  If you’ve been exposed to coronavirus and you’re better and you don’t have the virus in your blood, we could collect the blood. Now, this is a possible treatment; this is not a proven treatment — just want to emphasize that.  Collect the blood, concentrate that, and have the ability, once it’s pathogen-free — that is, virus-free — to be able to give that to other patients.  And the immunoglobulins — the immune response — could potentially provide a benefit to patients.
It’s another thing that we’re looking at.  Over the next couple weeks, we’ll have more information on that.  We’re really pushing hard to try to accelerate that.  That’s in the sort of more medium- and short-term.  And that’ll be a bridge to other therapies that will take us three to six months to develop.
And this is a continuous process.  There is no beginning and end to each of this.  This is — you know, we’re pushing this through.
The other great thing about the great innovators of America is some of them tell us it’s taken us years — years — to develop therapies.  They’re looking at pushing that to the months period of time.  And we’re trying to provide them the reg- — the regulatory flexibility, but, at same time, the scientific oversight to make sure that gets done in the best way possible for the American people.
The President mentioned that there is a vaccine trial currently being performed.  It’s a phase-one trial, so it’s the earliest study that gets done.  We expect that to take 12 months to get to completion — to actually a time where we could approve a vaccine.  But that’s — these are all things to bridge to the prevention part of this with a vaccine.  It’s exciting work.  And the President is right: This is record time for the development of a vaccine and impressive public-private partnership.
The FDA’s efforts to facilitate the development of these products are focused on ensuring timely access, while also meeting the agency’s world-respected gold standard, relying on strong data from clinical trials to determine if an experimental or an off-the-shelf drug that’s used for something else can safely and effectively treat patients.  We want to assure the American people that FDA is all hands on deck, as the President mentioned — these efforts — and continue to work with interested sponsors to help expedite the work.  We remain steadfast in helping to foster the development of safe and effective therapies for COVID-19.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you very much.
Mike?  Talk about the masks, maybe.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning.  And on this very first day of spring, we continue to make steady progress toward President Trump’s objective not only to marshal all the resources of the federal government, every state government, every local health official, but also to harness the power of the American private sector.  And activities over the last day reflect all of those priorities.
Yesterday, the President spoke with America’s top physicians and nurses and garnered helpful insights about how we can best serve those who are serving Americans that are dealing with the coronavirus.  We also had a productive call with over 5,000 state and local officials, explaining the federal government’s approach and our strong and seamless partnership with all 50 states and the territories.
Last night, as you heard, the President signed the Family First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, family leave for caregivers, and food assistance for the needy, among a broad range of benefits.  And today, as the President indicated, we expect that the Senate will begin work on an economic relief package.
Later today, the President and I will meet again in a teleconference with the nation’s governors.  We will meet at the National Response Coordination Center at FEMA and outline President Trump’s decision to have FEMA take the lead in our national coronavirus response.  Our nation’s response, through FEMA, will be locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.
On testing, we want the American people to know once again that testing is available in all 50 states and is becoming increasingly available literally every hour of the day.  Because of the public-private partnership that the President initiated several weeks ago with major commercial labs, I’m pleased to receive a report today that tens of thousands of tests are being performed every day.  And with the passage of last night’s legislations, state and private labs are now required by law to report all coronavirus testing directly to the CDC, which will give the American public and also give our researchers timely and important information.
It’s important for every American to remember that if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need to get a test.  We want to make sure that testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms or have a genuine concern about having been exposed to someone with the coronavirus.
Dr. Birx will address county-level data, as well as the progress we’ve made on testing.  And Americans can expect to see how an increased number of cases, as our new testing system comes online, should not be a cause of concern.  She’ll explain the importance of taking into account our new testing system as new data arrives over the next several days.
On supplies, a priority the President has given to our task force: We continue to work with healthcare providers, businesses, and state leadership to identify available supplies — not merely in the federal stockpile, but much more importantly, available across the private sector.
We’re encouraged to see companies like Honeywell and 3M, that I visited a few short weeks ago, take advantage of the changes in the law last night that allow the sale of industrial masks directly to hospitals.  Those companies have now greatly increased, by the tens of millions, their production of so-called N-95 masks that will give our healthcare workers the protection that they need to minister to those that are dealing with the symptoms or the disease of coronavirus.
Following the signing of last night’s bill, all of those masks now have liability protection and the companies can sell industrial masks to hospitals.  It is encouraging, as we called out yesterday, to see construction companies all across America that are, as we speak, checking their supplies and donating those industrial masks to their local hospitals.
And I know I speak on behalf of the President, who spent a lot of time as a builder, when we thank builders across America for partnering with our local healthcare officials.
On the subject of ventilators: We’re working with healthcare providers around America and suppliers.  And I’m — we’re encouraged to learn that we’ve literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that being — can be converted to treat patients.  And we remain increasingly confident that we will have the ventilators that we need as the coronavirus makes its way across America.
And as we said before, this — we’re all in this together.  And before I step away and give the podium back to the President and to Dr. Birx, I want to call every American’s attention again to the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  We continue to hear one case after another, one city after another, where people are putting into practice the principles that the President outlined this Monday.
And make no mistake about it that while for the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low, these guidelines should be practiced by every American in every community not only to lessen the spread of the coronavirus, but to protect the most vulnerable among us.  And I think Americans with their — with — from their hearts are not only practicing these principles of social distancing and avoiding social gatherings of more than 10 people, using drive-throughs at restaurants to protect their own health and the health of their family, but they’re also recognizing that no American wants to inadvertently convey the coronavirus to someone for whom the consequences could be quite serious.
At the President’s direction, we’ll continue to marshal all the resources of government at every level.  We’ll be reiterating that strong partnership with America’s states this afternoon; with America’s governors, pulling all of the private-sector energy together — the innovation that you just heard described.
I know, on this first day of spring, that we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together.  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you very much.
Doctor, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  So I know you’re watching the data carefully.  You can see the dramatic increases in the number of new cases, based on our ability to test additional people.  And this will continue over the next two to three days as we begin to have backlogs reduced of the testing.  You all have heard the anecdotes of people waiting five or six days for their test results.  We are moving through all of that as well as testing individuals.
I really want to applaud the frontline healthcare workers — the nurses and the doctors and the testers — that have really prioritized — and the American people — who have prioritized those with symptoms.
The number of test positives is increasing.  That is a dramatically important signature that everybody is doing their job.  Those with mild symptoms are staying home, self-isolating; those with serious symptoms are coming forward to getting testing.  Our test positive rates are now in the 10 to 11 percent range.  That still means that 90 percent of the illnesses out there, even the severe ones, are not COVID-19.
I know many of you are looking at the state-level data.  Still, over 50 percent of the cases come from three states.  This is why we continue to prioritize testing in those states.  In addition, 50 percent of the cases come from 10 counties.  We are a very large country with very many counties.  And I just want to applaud the local and state governments that are implementing their emergency operation centers and plans to ensure.
I want to also really thank the healthcare workers that have been asked to reduce all elective surgeries, medical and dental visits.  This will dramatically increase the number of ventilators that are available in hospitals, but also in ambulatory surgical centers that can be converted and utilized.
And also, the — to the construction industry: We are deeply grateful, the number — as the Vice President said, the number of individuals have come forward with their construction masks, their booties, their tieback suits, and their masks to contribute them to the healthcare sector.
The President’s request to make this available in that legislation changes the ability and increases our availability immediately by the 75 to 90 percent range because of the amount of construction use of those elements.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor, very much.
Jerome?  Please.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:   Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  Today, you heard a wonderful announcement from the FDA, and I just want to give a shout-out to Steve — Dr. Hahn — and the folks at the FDA, where about — where several hundred of my Commissioned Corps officers work.  You’re right, Mr President, they are tireless.  They’re doing things that have never been done before to bring the most — most prudent advances to the American people.
But I want to talk about something different, briefly.  We know many of you are home practicing the President’s guidelines for social distancing.  But one thing we should all consider, especially our millennials and Gen Z, is donating blood.  As an anesthesiologist who still practices at Walter Reed, taking care of our wounded warriors and our soldiers, I know donated blood is an essential part of caring for patients, and one donation can save up to three lives.  Blood centers are open now and in need of your donation.  I want America to know that blood donation is safe, and blood centers are taking extra precautions at this time, based on new CDC recommendations, including spacing beds six feet apart, disinfecting surfaces between patients, temperature checking staff, and encouraging donors to make appointments ahead of time so we can space them out.
Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement.  So give blood today.  You’ll feel good about it and you’ll be helping your country and your community during this crisis.  And you might even save a life.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Jerome.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-6/

12:06 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.
We’ll be invoking the Defense Production Act, just in case we need it.  In other words, I think you all know what it is, and it can do a lot of good things if we need it.  And we will — we will have it all completed, signing it in just a little while.  Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it.  It’s prepared to go.  So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act.
Last week, I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which, as you know, we invoked previously and which activated FEMA’s National Response Coordination Center.  FEMA now is fully engaged at the highest levels.
Today, FEMA is activated in every region.  We are at level one — level one being the highest level — which we will work with, and we’ve been working with FEMA.  I’ve done a lot of work with FEMA.  They’re incredible.  It’s always been on hurricanes or tornadoes.
They’re, right now, in Tennessee — a large group working in Tennessee.  Have been incredible.  That was a tragic event.  Alabama, last year, also a tornado.  And then, obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were, in some cases, very devastating.  And, in every case, FEMA came through.
This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do.  We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA.
We’re sending, upon request, the two hospital ships; they’re being prepared right now.  They’re massive ships.  They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides.  One is called the Mercy and the other is called the Comfort.  And they are in tip-top shape.  They soon will be.  They’re getting ready to come up to New York.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it.  He’s excited about it.
And I also — we haven’t made the final determination as to where it’s going to go on the West Coast.  The Comfort is located now in San Diego, and it’s going to be — we’ll be picking the destination fairly shortly.  So those two ships are being prepared to go, and they can be launched over the next week or so, depending on need.
Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington State, as you probably know.  The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January.  But thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we’ve reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later.  That’s a record by many, many months.  It used to take years to do this, and now we did it just in a very short while.
That’s the fastest development in history of what we’re doing with regard to the vaccine.  We’re making very, very big progress.
Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity.  We’re working with several groups to determine if the self-swab — a much easier process than the current process that’s not very nice to do, I can tell you, because I did it.  But we have a current process that’s a little bit difficult.
If you haven’t done — the groups are working on determining if a self-swab by an individual is as effective as the other.  The other is very effective, very accurate.  But we’re going to see if we can do a self-swab, which is — would be a lot more popular, I can tell you that.  So — and that would be administered also by a health official, but it would be a lot easier to do.
The — the fact is that the health professionals would — it would free — it would free up a lot.  Let me just say, the self-swab is what it is: It’s a self-swab; you do it yourself.  The other has to be issued by a health professional, and it’s something that is quite difficult.  And we think it’s working out for the self-swab.  And if it would test positive, the people would go and they would do what they have to do.  But we think that’s probably working out.
I’ve asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers.  We are looking at some very exciting things.  And I’m going to be holding a second news conference either today.  We’re going to talk about the FDA.  Some things are happening that are quite exciting.  And we’re going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow — fairly early tomorrow.  So we’ll see what happens.
But the FDA, at my instruction, is — have been working very, very hard on a number of developments, and we’ll be discussing them with you later today or tomorrow.
And this afternoon, I’ll be meeting with nurses on the frontlines of the battle against the virus.  They are truly American heroes.  They want to get it done.  They’re incredible people.  So we’re going to be meeting with nurses, and I actually look forward to that.  They’re very brave.  They’re taking a lot of risk.  And they — they have done an incredible job and they never complain.
Today, I’m also announcing that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April.  So we’re working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD.
Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation.  In World War Two, young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight.  They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country.  Workers refused to go home and slept on factory floors to keep assembly lines running.
And, you know, the numbers of ships that they built during World War Two, to this day has never — nothing like that has ever been equal.  They were doing ships on a — literally on a daily basis.  Nobody has ever seen anything like it.  To this day, nobody has seen anything like what they were able to do during World War Two.
And now it’s our time.  We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we’ll come through together.  It’s the invisible enemy.  That’s always the toughest enemy: the invisible enemy.  But we’re going to defeat the invisible enemy.  I think we’re going to do it even faster than we thought.  And it will be a complete victory.  It’ll be a total victory.
So we’ll have a second conference, again, having to do with the FDA and this.  I think it’s going to be potentially a very exciting news conference.  And we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it’s today or tomorrow.
And I’ll, with that, ask Mike Pence to say a few words.  And thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning, and now that we have cases in all 50 states, we’re continuing to move out on the President’s call to bring the full resources of the federal government, the full partnership with every state and territory, the full power of the American economy, to support businesses and families.
As the President says to us and every day: We’ll do whatever it takes.  We’re all in this together.
Yesterday, the President met with the tourism industry executives and also had an engaging discussion with all the top companies in our industrial and medical supply chain.
And the President, as you all are aware, also announced today that by mutual consent, the northern border to Canada will be closed to non-essential travel.  This does not include essential travel or the transit of goods.  But it was through a mutual discussion that took place this morning between the President and Prime Minister Trudeau.  And the Department of Homeland Security will be effectuating that decision.
The President spoke with some of the nation’s top business leaders today, again, to speak about the supply chain in the country.  And, for our part, we’re going to be conducting a conference call later today with state and local health officials to renew our ongoing commitment of cooperation and collaboration.
As the President said last week in signing the Stafford Act, he stood up the National Response Coordination Center.  And today at the President’s direction, FEMA has gone to level one. FEMA’s mission is to support disasters that are locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.
And tomorrow, the President will be hosting all the nation’s governors, from a video conference at FEMA, to ensure that they have full connection to all of the activated regions for FEMA going forward.
With regard to testing, I’m pleased to report that we’re increasing the number of tests being performed by the thousands, every day, thanks to the public-private partnership that President Trump forged with commercial laboratories around the country.
Our health experts tell us to remind every American: It’s important to remember people without symptoms should not get tested.  We want to make sure that the supply of testing is there for those that need it most or are symptomatic or in the vulnerable population.
Dr. Deborah Birx, in a moment, will address the progress that we’re making on testing, the infection rate, our recommendations to every American, as well as some important new findings about the impact on youth that we’re gaining from data that’s coming in from Europe that’ll be important to every — every American.
On the subject of supplies, the President has our task force extremely focused.  As the President mentioned yester- —  mentioned that he’s invoking the Defense Production Act today.  Secretary Esper, in a few moments, will describe the ongoing efforts that the Department of Defense is taking to make medical resources available.  Secretary Robert Wilkie will announce decisions the VA has made to expand hospital capacity within their system.
Also, with regard to medical personnel, at the President’s direction, HHS is issuing a regulation today that will allow all doctors and medical professionals to practice across state lines to meet the needs of hospitals that may arise in adjoining areas.
In addition to that, we are again today asking every American and our medical community leaders and hospitals to partner with us in delaying elective procedures across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they’re needed most.  Seema Verma will describe guidance that CMS will be issuing on that front.
And finally, just, I want to remind every American of the President’s 15-day guidance to slow the spread.  We’re grateful for members of the media and the general public that are adhering to these, sharing them with neighbors and friends.  All of our experts continue to believe that if every American will do their part, and embrace and put into practice these principles, that we can significantly limit the reach of the coronavirus in the weeks and months ahead.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Dr. Birx, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  So, you know, we continue to look at data every single day.  There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill, and very seriously ill in the ICUs.
We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk.  It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be a disproportional number of infections among that group.  And so even if it’s a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now.
So we’re looking at that information very carefully.  We have not seen any significant mortality in the children, but we are concerned about the early reports coming out of Italy and France.
So, again, I’m going to call on that generation that’s part of that group that brought us innovation, particularly throughout all of their ability to look around corners and skip through games.  I’m — I always went level by level; I didn’t realize that you could go from level three to level seven.  That’s what they’ve taught us.  They look for things that we don’t see.  We need them to be healthy.
So, again, not only calling on you to heed what’s in the guidance, but to really ensure that each and every one of you are protecting each other.  And so we cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus.  You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome.
Finally, on the testing piece and what we’re learning: I know you know, last week, in bringing the private sector — I think what has been exciting to me over the last two and a half weeks is to see this administration harness the full capacity of the private sector, understanding that a lot of our solutions that we need to confront this virus, a lot rely on the private sector.  Bringing the private-sector commercial labs was critical in — to this process.  We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way, because we asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected.
And so you still may have difficulty getting tests in areas that do not have significant cases.  We’ve had them prioritize the regions where we need diagnosis and their diagnostic percent.  Remember, I told you South Korea was under 4 percent, so 96 percent of people were negative.  The last report we’ve seen from the laboratories have about a 7-plus percent positivity rate.  Still, 93-plus percent or 92 percent are negative.  But I think that’s encouraging to me, personally, that we’re prioritizing appropriately to those areas that have the greatest need
Today and yesterday, Thermo Fisher pushed out most of their laboratory testing capacity, and that will dramatically increase that platform and the ability to run additional tests, in addition to Roche.
So I appreciate everybody’s attention to these numbers.  I’m excited that we’ve prioritized where the need was the greatest.  But again, please follow the guidance and please make sure in every report that you’re putting out that you’re talking about the presidential guidance to actually stop the spread of this virus.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Deborah, very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Mark, please.
SECRETARY ESPER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  So, good afternoon, everyone.  And I want to provide an update on DOD’s coronavirus efforts as we continue to focus on our three priorities.  That’s, first of all, protecting our personnel and their families.  Second, safeguarding our national security mission capabilities.  And third, of course, supporting the administration’s whole-of-government approach.
First of all, though, I do want to assure the American people that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the country and our interests abroad.  Now, with that, the department is leaning forward in our response to COVID-19.  We have issued international and domestic travel restrictions to all DOD personnel and families that should dramatically reduce potential exposure to the virus.  Those have been in place for some time now.
As I announced yesterday, the Department of Defense will make available up to 5 million N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from our own strategic reserves to the Department of Health and Human Services for distribution.  The first 1 million masks will be available immediately.  We are also prepared to distribute to HHS up to 2,000 operational deployable ventilators for use as needed.
Yesterday, I was at Fort Detrick, Maryland, which is probably the military’s premier research institute, where I got updated on the incredible work our people are doing as part of the interagency team to work on vaccines and therapeutics.  They’re making great progress there.
We also have announced that we’ve certified our 16th lab — or we’ll soon certify our 16th lab to help with processing tests from across the country.
Additionally, I have directed, as the President mentioned, that the hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort, be prepared to deploy to increase the nation’s medical capacity.  And we have also alerted a variety of field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the Commander-in-Chief.
Today, leadership from the Army Corps of Engineers is in New York meeting with Governor Cuomo and his team.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo yesterday and other governors.  I will be speaking to more in the coming days to make sure that they know what DOD can provide through our system to address their needs.
In my conversations with governors and members of Congress about DOD’s resources, I’ve made it clear that we will continue to support the administration’s comprehensive efforts and the country every step of the way, while ensuring our nation’s security remains the top priority.
I want to conclude by thanking again all of our service members and their families who have been affected by this outbreak.  They’re all great heroes.  We are continuing to support them throughout this.  We are all in this together.
Thank you all very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mark.
THE PRESIDENT:  Seema, go ahead.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  So, yesterday, the President made a very important announcement about telehealth, and this is allowing our 62 million seniors to be able to get some medical services from the safety of their home, reducing their risk and without any co-pays.
But we’re also making sure that the healthcare system is prepared and that those on the frontlines have the support that they need.  The reality is the stakes are high and we need to preserve personal protective equipment for those that are on the frontlines of this fight.
And to that end, we have put out guidelines over the last two weeks to expand the types of masks that can be used in routine care and saving those N95s for the most risky situations.
Conserving personal protective equipment is also essential to combat the virus.  So today, CMS will announce detailed recommendations to further promote this needed conservation, specifically by limiting non-essential elective medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures.
We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients, and hospitals prioritize what is essential while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients.
And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations.  They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the frontlines, and it will protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.
We fully appreciate that this is going to have a major impact on the healthcare system, but the shared sacrifice is essential to help those that are on the frontlines.
And I want to thank the medical societies, such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Dental Association, that took a proactive approach and already posted these recommendations.  And we’ve also talked to the American Medical Association, and they have fully indicated their support for this recommendation.  We now invite the entire healthcare community to join us in this effort.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Robert.
THE PRESIDENT:  Robert, please.
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My instructions from the President were very clear.  I was to do everything imaginable, as aggressively as possible, to protect the 9.5 million veterans who are part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Last month, we established 19 emergency operations centers across the country.  We began to limit the number of visitors who entered our facilities.  We began, I think, the first — we were the first system to begin triaging, across the country in our 170 hospitals, the entrance of anyone into our facility without being questioned or tested.
We expanded those restrictions to those in our 135 community living centers, which have about 7,800 veterans who are in acute — in acute conditions to make sure that they were protected.  We also took the next step and made sure that we limited the dental surgeries that we were provided.  We’ve cut back by one third the number of routine appointments we have had, and we have canceled elective surgeries.
These were all part of the President’s directive to be as aggressive in a public health sense as we could be.  I think we have set the pace for the entire country.
I will say, we’ve often said that we work the most noble mission in the federal government.  Our veterans have been in the toughest spots in the world.  They have been put in conditions that are unimaginable to most Americans, and they have responded.  They have responded clearly.  They have responded with passion.  And also, the 400,000 members of our department who are out there on the frontlines.
The last thing I will say is that you’ve heard a lot about the fourth mission that VA has.  Our first three missions are healthcare, benefits, and memorial affairs.  Our fourth mission is to support the federal government in times of natural disasters and pandemics.
We are the buttress force in case that FEMA or HHS calls upon us to deploy medical professionals across the country to meet crises.  We plan for that every day.  We are gaming out emergency preparedness scenarios.  And we stand ready, when the President needs us, to expand our mission.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Robert, thank you.  Thank you all.  That’s very nice.

11:39 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Thank you.  Progress being made.  And I appreciate you all joining us.
Last night, the FDA announced groundbreaking new policies to further increase testing very substantially so.  All states can now authorize tests developed and used within their borders, in addition to the FDA.  So the states are very much involved.  They have been involved from the beginning.  But we’re stepping it up as much as we can, and the testing procedures are going well.
And within a short period of time, all other private labs will kick in.  This has never been done before, and it’s going to be something very — I think it’s going to be incredible if it’s done properly.  And these are great companies.  These are among the greatest companies in the world, actually.
So the states are going to be dealing through themselves and with local government, local physicians, local everybody.  They’re also dealing with us.  But we have a tremendous testing capacity.
Today, we’re also announcing a dramatic expansion of our Medicare telehealth services.  Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional cost, including with commonly used services like FaceTime and Skype — a historic breakthrough.  This has not been done before either.  In addition, states have the authority to cover telehealth services for their medical patients.  And by doing this, the patient is not seeing the doctor, per se, but they’re seeing the doctor.  So there’s no getting close.
During this time, we will not enforce applicable HIPAA penalties so that doctors can greatly expand care for their patients using telehealth.  So the penalties won’t be enforced.  We encourage everyone to maximize use of telehealth to limit exposure to the virus.  It’s been a very successful method of communication but never used on a scale like we’re going to use on telehealth.  And you’ll be able to also better maintain hospital capacity by doing this.
Earlier this morning, I spoke with executives from America’s fast-food industry — Wendy’s, McDonald’s, all of the big ones, Burger King — and they were great.  We were talking about the pick-ups in light of yesterday’s guidance, you heard, to avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, or public food courts.  We discussed the important role that the drive-through, pick-up, and delivery service can play in the weeks ahead.
So that’s happening, and they have been fantastic.  They have been absolutely fantastic.  And they’ve been doing it already.  But they’re keeping it open and smaller staffs.  They’re very capable people and very capable companies, and they’re doing it, the pick-ups.
Our guidance yesterday urges Americans to take action for 15 days to help stem the outbreak.  So it’s a 15-day period.  I guess, now I would say it’s a 14-day period.  It was 15 days from yesterday, and we’re asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people.  By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy, because I think our economy will come back very rapidly.  So it’s 15 days from yesterday.  We’ll see what happens after that.  If we do this right, our country — and the world, frankly — but our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.  Pretty quickly.
We have to fight that invisible enemy that, I guess, unknown but we’re getting to know it a lot better.
Today, the Senate is taking up coronavirus legislation that includes free testing for those who need it, as well as paid sick leave and family medical leave for workers affected by the virus.  We’re also committed to getting small businesses the support that they need.  In fact, one of the things we talked about with the fast food operations — we spoke to the chairmen and CEOs of all of the companies — but one of the things we discussed is exactly that: getting small businesses support and flexibility that they need for themselves and for their workers, and that’s being worked on right now.
At my direction, Secretary Mnuchin is meeting today with senators on additional stimulus packages.  I can tell you he was meeting with them late until the night, last night, and for a big part of the day yesterday, and tremendous things are happening.  There’s great spirit.  Tremendous spirit.  And I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.
I can say that, with respect to Governor Cuomo, we had a great talk this morning.  We’re both doing a really good job, and we’re coordinating it.  And we agree — you know, different states need different things.  And we — we agree on that 100 percent.  But we had a very good talk, and I think we’re right down the same track, and it’s going to be very successful.
New York has a pretty big problem.  I guess, would be the number one hotspot.  It’s no fault of anybody.  It’s just the way it is.  But we’re working very closely together.  We’re also getting FEMA very much involved.  They’ve been involved, but now we’re getting them to a different level, and we’ll have everything ready.  We’re dealing with the Army Corps of Engineers should that be necessary.  We have them working, in some cases; on standby, in other cases.
But my conversation with Andrew Cuomo was a very, very productive one and a very good one.  And I appreciate that.
We’re giving relief to affected industries and small businesses, and we’re ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy because that’s what’s going to happen.  It’s going to pop.  One day, we’ll be standing, possibly up here, and we’ll say, “Well, we won.”  And we’re going to say that.  As sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that.  And we’re going to win, and I think we’re going to win faster than people think, I hope.
Later today, I’ll meet with the leaders from the tourism industry, as well as industrial supply retailers and wholesalers, to discuss their critical roles.  As you know, I met with the department store people, all of the retailers — the big ones, including Walmart and others — and it was a great meeting.  They’re stocking up their stores like they’ve never stocked them before.  We’re trying to get people to actually buy less if that’s possible.  Buy less.  Don’t take everything.  Just buy what you need for a while.  It’s — they’re going to stay open all hours of the day.  And they’ve really been — they’ve been fantastic.
We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger — frankly, stronger than ever before.  And we recognize that while many American workers can work from home, many others cannot.  Many of our healthcare providers, first responders, and men and women in the food service and manufacturing are showing at — they’re showing up and standing up to provide us with the goods and services we need.
So we want people to stay home where they can, but in many cases, when you talk about food service and manufacturing, certain items in particular, they are — they’re going in and they’re practicing all of the safety rules and regulations that we talk about.
So with that, I’d like to just introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence.  He’ll say a few words, and then I’ll make some other introductions.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning.  It should be very clear to the American people that President Trump has initiated not only a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-America approach.  And the President’s interaction, even today and through the course of this day, with leaders in industry around the country, reflects that we’re not only bringing the full weight of the federal government to bear, but the full weight of the American economy.
And I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how inspired we are at the way the American people have stepped up and the way that American businesses, large and small, have stepped up.  It’s truly been inspiring.
Our task force met this morning.  We continue to focus on President Trump’s priorities of testing, prevention, and supplies.  And in that category, I’m pleased to report that while testing is available in all 50 states, as the President just indicated, through the swift action of the FDA, at the encouragement of governors around the country, now state health authorities can authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.
But also in connection with the FDA’s action, which you’ll hear more about in a moment, we now have continued to expand the public and private partnership that the President forged with vast commercial laboratories around the country, increasing access to the high volume of high-throughput coronavirus testing that is greatly expanding access even as we speak.
Also, our task force received a report this morning on the progress that the U.S. Public Health Service and FEMA are making, working closely with state governments and also partners in the private sector like CVS, Target, Walgreen, and Walmart, to expand remote testing sites around the country.  And we’ll have a full report later this week as those come online.
It’s important the American people understand that testing is happening all over the country.  But all of our health experts wanted me to tell the American people you don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do.  And President Trump’s 15-day coronavirus guidelines are advice for every American in every community.  They’re the result of the best guidance of CDC and our health experts.
And, as the President said, we continue to urge every American over the next 15 days to put into practice the principles in the President’s coronavirus guidelines.  By every American practicing these principles, we believe that we can slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In fact, our experts have told our taskforce that if every American acts on the President’s coronavirus guidelines, we could see a substantial reduction in the spread of the coronavirus.
But as the President said, it will take all of us to do it.  And so, if you feel sick, stay home.  If someone in your house tests positive, keep the entire household home.  Especially if you’re a person with an underlying health condition, we urge you to stay home and practice social distancing from people.  No social gatherings of more than 10 people.  Use drive-through, as the President discussed with leaders in the industry today.  And every American, especially practicing common sense and good hygiene.
For the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low, but we’re asking every American to partner with us in this effort to slow the spread of the virus and especially to be mindful of seniors or others with serious underlying health conditions for whom the threat of the coronavirus can be very significant and very real.
As I said, the President has continued to push our task force to bring a whole-of-government, a whole-of-America approach.  And we continue to be inspired the way our nation’s governors, the nation’s businesses are responding.
We spoke just yesterday with the leaders of every broadcast network in America that will soon be unveiling a public service campaign using CDC guidelines.  And specifically, as we work on the issue of supplies — meetings yesterday with Department of Defense officials about excess supplies; the President and I will be meeting today to speak about the supply chain for hospitals — we would make one specific request, and that is: We would urge construction companies to donate their inventory of N95 masks to your local hospital and forego additional orders of those industrial masks.
Because of what the President asked to be included in legislation moving through the Congress today, those industrial masks that they use on construction sites are perfectly acceptable for healthcare workers to be protected from a respiratory disease.
But we’re asking construction companies that our President knows very well from his background — we’re asking them to donate their N95 masks to their local hospitals and also forego making additional orders.
At the President’s direction, we will — we will continue to do whatever it takes.  We’ll continue to marshal the best of the American people, the best of all the people behind me, the people behind them, our state and local officials.  And we will get through this, and we will get through this together.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:   I want to thank Chad Wolf and Homeland Security.  The job they did at the airports was really incredible.  They screened thousands and thousands of people.  O’Hare got backed up, but — a little bit, but they got them out.  But everybody was screened and screened very carefully.  They didn’t want to rush it.  I think it was 13 airports.  And it was — it was an incredible thing.  Then they had a big surge also from the UK and Ireland, and that went very smoothly.  But they did a fantastic job.  They worked long hours and they did a fantastic job.
I’d like to introduce Steve Mnuchin, and then I’m going to ask Steve to leave because he’s going to the Hill.  He’s been working very hard with the Senate and with — actually, with the House on a very, very big, bold package.  It’s going to be big and it’s going to be bold.  And the level, again, of enthusiasm to get something done, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like it.
So, Steve Mnuchin, please.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’d like to announce some very significant actions that the President has approved today.  The first, I would say, is: Earlier today, I sent a letter to Fed Chairman Powell approving his request to use 13(3).  And what that will do is, the Fed will be setting up a special purpose vehicle, which the Treasury will invest $10 billion in from one of our funds.  That will enable the Fed to guarantee the purchase of A1/P1 commercial paper going forward.  That is a 1-trillion-dollar market and it is critical to American workers, it’s critical to American business, and it’s critical to American savers who have a lot of that money in money market funds.
So we heard, loud and clear, there were liquidity issues.  This is very significant.  And we’ll create — I don’t think we’ll need to use it all, but we have the ability to have the Fed purchase up to $1 trillion of commercial paper, as needed.  That has already created significant stability in the market today.
The second thing I would say is, you know, we’ve previously talked about deferring IRS payments.  The President, earlier this morning, authorized me to announce this program.  I have previously announced we would defer $200 billion.  The President suggested we increase that to $300 billion, which we will be doing.
Now, let me just be clear on the specifics: We encourage those Americans who can file their taxes to continue to file their taxes on April 15, because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds.  We want you to make sure you get them.  Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.
If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to a million dollars as an individual.  And the reason why we’re doing a million dollars is that covers lots of pass-throughs and small businesses, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days.  All you have to do is file your taxes.  You’ll automatically not get charged interest in penalties.
Now, of course, any American has the right to extend their taxes.  We’re not taking that right.  But the President has asked us to go up to $300 billion.  That’s also an enormous amount of liquidity in the system.
The third thing is the President and I worked on a very significant economic stimulus plan.  Thank you for being available last night and throughout this morning.  And I will be presenting that to the Republicans in the Senate this morning and also discussing that with the House.
We look forward to having bipartisan support.  We’re now working with the Senate to pass this legislation very quickly.  And these will be payments to small businesses.  We’ve talked about loan guarantees to critical industries such as airlines and hotels.  And we’ve also talked about a stimulus package to the American worker.  You can think of this as something like business interruption payments for the American workers.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Do you have any questions for the Secretary of the Treasury?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-4/

3:21 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  So, I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing.  That looks very nice.  It’s very good.
I want to thank everybody for being here today.  This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G7 — G7 nations — and they really had a good meeting.  I think it was a very, very productive meeting.  I also spoke with our nation’s governors.
This afternoon, we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days as we combat the virus.  Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus.  We did this today, and this was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom are standing with me.  And that’s available.  And Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes.
It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus, and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way.  We especially worry about our senior citizens.
The White House Task Force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast-evolving situation that this has become all over the world.  It’s all over the world.  It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time.
On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx, and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now.  We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that’s what we are.  Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible.  Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people.  Avoid discretionary travel.  And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.
If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus.  And we’re going to have a big celebration all together.
With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly.  A lot of progress has been made.  I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial.  This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history.  Not even close.  We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments.  And we’ve had some promising results — early results, but promising — to reduce the severity and the duration of the synd- — of the symptoms.
And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes, we’re doing.  We’re doing it in every way.
And with that, I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend.
Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think you know, over the last months, we’ve taken very bold action to stop the virus from coming to our shores.  And because of that, we gained time to really get together and understand the progress across the globe of what has worked and what hasn’t worked.
We now need to appeal to every single American so that they can have their role in stopping the spread of this virus.  We’ve talked about things before, about washing your hands, but we really want to focus on: If you are sick, no matter who you are, please stay home.  If someone in your household is diagnosed with this virus, the entire household should quarantine in the house to prevent spread of the virus to others.
The reason we’re taking these strong and bold steps is because we know there is virus spread before you develop symptoms, and then we know that there’s a large group — we don’t know the precise percent yet — that actually is asymptomatic or has such mild cases that they continue to spread the virus.  If your children are sick, please keep them home.
Now, to our older population or those with preexisting medical conditions, everyone in the household needs to focus on protecting them.  Everyone in the household.
I want to speak particularly to our largest generation now: our millennials.  I have — I’m the mom of two wonderful millennial young women who are bright and hardworking, and I will tell you what I told to them: They are the core group that will stop this virus.  They’re the group that communicates successfully, independent of picking up a phone.  They intuitively know how to contact each others without being in large social gatherings.
We’re asking all of them to hold their gatherings to under 10 people, not just in bars and restaurants, but in homes.  We really want people to be separated at this time, to be able to address this virus comprehensively that we cannot see, for which we don’t have a vaccine or a therapeutic.  The only thing we have right now is the amazing ingenuity and compassion of the American people.
We’re appealing to all Americans to take these steps to protect each other and to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread.  These guidelines are very specific.  They’re very detailed.  They will only work if every American takes this together to heart and responds as one nation and one people to stop the spread of this virus.
Thank you.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Dr. Birx.  So just to connect with what I mentioned to you in previous discussions in this room — and Dr. Birx said it very well — that in order to be able to contain and curtail this epidemic to not reach its maximum capability, we have a two-pillar approach, one of which I believe has been very effective in preventing the substantial seeding, and namely the travel restrictions that we’ve discussed many times in this room.
The other, equally, if not more important, is when you have infection in your own country, which we do.  And you know I could read the numbers, but they’re really, essentially, what we’ve seen yesterday: incremental increases, both globally as well as in the United States, with the curve doing that.  So therefore, the kinds of things that we do are containment and mitigation.
This — what we’re mentioning now — the guidelines, when you look at them carefully, I believe if the people in the United States take them seriously, because they were based on some rather serious consideration back and forth, some may look at them and say they’re going to be really inconvenient for people.  Some will look and say, well, maybe we’ve gone a little bit too far.  They were well thought out.
And the thing that I want to reemphasize, and I’ll say it over and over again: When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are.  That’s not word speak.  It means: If you think you’re here, you’re really here because you’re only getting the results; therefore, it will always seem that the best way to address it were to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction.  It isn’t an overreaction.  It’s a reaction that we feel is commensurate, which is actually going on in reality.
So take a look at the guidelines.  Read them carefully.  And we hope that the people of the United States will take them very seriously, because they will fail if people don’t adhere to them.  We have to have, as a whole country, cooperate and collaborate to make sure these get done.
Thank you.

5:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Beautiful day outside.  And I think we have some great things to talk about.  I’ll start by discussing the Federal Reserve.  As you know, it just happened minutes ago, but, to me, it makes me very happy.  And I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve.
For starters, they’ve lowered the Fed rate from what it was, which was 1 to 1.25.  And it’s been lowered down to zero, to 0.25 or .25.  So it’s 0 to .25.  That’s a big difference.  It’s quite a bit.  It’s about a point.
And, in addition, very importantly, the Federal Reserve is the — going to be purchasing $500 billion of treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities.  And that number can increase.  But they’re going to start with that, and that’s really good news.  It’s really great for our country.  It’s something that we’re very happy.  I have to say this: I’m very happy.  And they did it in one step; they didn’t do it in four steps over a long period of time.  They did it in one step.
And I think that people in the market should be very thrilled.  And that brings us — we’re the strongest country in the world, by far, financially and every other way.  And that brings us in line with what other countries are.  They’re actually — they actually have negative rates.  But, look, we got it down to potentially zero.  So that’s a big step, and I’m very happy they did it.
And you will not hear anything bad about me unless it’s about a month or two from now.  So I congratulate the Federal Reserve.  I think it’s terrific.  It just came out, just as we spoke.  I wasn’t going to mention Federal Reserve or anything else, but this came out as we were walking up.
I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday.  The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, said — called us and he apologized.  I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace.  But as you know — this is from Google — they put out a release.  And you guys can figure it out yourselves.  And how that got out — and I’m sure you’ll apologize.  But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly.  It would be so, so wonderful.
I just had a phone call with very impressive people — the biggest in the world, in the world of stores and groceries and all.  And I’ll give you the names:
Dave Clark, Whole Foods.
Mark Clouse, CEO of Campbell Soup Company.
Brian Cornell, CEO of Target.
Randy Edeker, Chairman and CEO, President of Hy-Vee.
Jeff Harmening, CEO of General Mills.  A great company.
Kevin Hourican, President and CEO of Sysco.
Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco.
Todd Jones, CEO of Publix Super Markets.
Donnie King, Tyson Foods.
David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill.
Rodney McMullan, CEO, Chairman of Kroger — a big company.
Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart.  He’s been fantastic.  Doug was here, as you know, on Friday.  And he watched the market go up 2,000 points.  On Friday, it went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points.
Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General Corporation.
And Vivek Sankaran, President and CEO of Albertsons.
So these are all phenomenal companies.  These are great companies.  We had a long conversation with them.  And they’ve — they’re going to work 24 hours around the clock keeping their store stocked.
I would like to say that people shouldn’t go out and buy.  We’re going to all be great.  We’re going to be so good.  We’re going to do — what’s happened with the Fed is phenomenal news.  What’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news.
But you don’t have to buy so much.  Take it easy.  Just relax.  People are going in and they’re buying more.  I remember — I guess, during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they’re buying more than they buy at Christmas.  Relax.  We’re doing great.  It all will pass.
The folks that we spoke to, they’ve done a fantastic job.  They’re going to meet the needs of the public.  They’re going around the clock, if they have to.  And they’re committed to the communities where they’re serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time.  And they’re buying a lot of additional things to sell.
But again, they — they actually have asked me to say, “Could you buy a little bit less, please?”  I think — I thought I’d never hear that from a retailer.
All of them are working hand-in-hand with the federal government, as well as the state and local leaders, to ensure food and essentials are constantly available.  And they’ll do it.  There’s no shortages.  We have no shortages — other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy.  It’s going to be there for a long time.
We’re doing numbers, and there’s a pent-up demand that’s incredible.  When this passes, when this goes through, you’re going to see numbers — I think, I predict; I guess I’m allowed to predict just like Wall Street people are allowed to predict, and they’re pretty much in agreement — you’re going to see there’s a pent-up demand like — like a lot of people, including me, haven’t seen before.  But this has to get through.
They know they’re getting through the crisis and will require an all-of-America approach, and that’s very important.  They’re committed to remaining open during this crisis.  Totally open.  They have to stay open.  Those stores have to stay open.  They supply our country.
Our supply chains in America are the most powerful in the world, and they’re all working very hard.  They’re working around the clock.  And the stores are stocking up at a level that’s beyond Christmastime.  And it’s — it’s great.  It was very reassuring speaking to these people.  They have it totally in hand.
There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies.  They said to me, “Could you please tell them just go and buy, enjoy it.”  Have a nice dinner.  Relax.  Because there’s plenty.  But you don’t have to the quantities because it’s hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they’re refilling them.
And we’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the coronavirus, and we will do whatever it takes.  And we’re doing, I think, really, really well.  A lot of good things are going to happen.
I want to thank all of the people standing behind me.  You know, these are phenomenal people, and we have some of them right over here.  But the people behind me have been working around the clock, and they’re doing an incredible job.
We see what’s happening.  We see what’s going on in other countries.  We’re looking at — we’re learning from watching other countries, frankly.  This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus.  It’s incredible.  But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.
I think, very important, the young people and people of good health, and groups of people, just are not strongly affected.  Elderly people that are not well, or not well in certain respects, are, really, a very dangerous group.  We have to watch them.  We have to protect them very much.  We have to really watch over them and protect them because they are very vulnerable.
And with that, if it’s okay, I’m just going to go and make some calls.  I’m talking about Federal Reserve.  I think it’s a tremendous thing that took place just now.  I didn’t know I’d be surprised on a Sunday.  I don’t know if that’s ever happened on a Sunday before.  But I would think there are a lot of people on Wall Street that are very happy.  And I can tell you that I’m very happy.  I didn’t expect this, and I like being surprised.
So our Vice President, who’s doing an incredible job, is going to take over.  And I will see you probably tomorrow.  Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon.  With more than 2,900 cases of coronavirus in 49 states across the country, I want to assure the American people that this administration, all of our partners at the state level, and local health officials have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American public.
And at the President’s direction, we will continue not only a whole-of-government approach, but as we’ll discuss today, we’ll continue to build on a whole-of-America approach to confront the coronavirus across the country.
The health experts continue to confirm to us that based on the latest information, for the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low.  But because the risk is heavily weighted to the most vulnerable — to people with immunodeficiencies and to people who are elderly with serious underlying chronic health conditions — our administration and, I know, state administrations will continue to focus on the most vulnerable.  And we will continue to urge every American to be vigilant in practicing good hygiene and taking the advice of the CDC and local health experts to keep those most vulnerable safe.
I know I speak on behalf of the President and our entire team when I say how grateful we are for governors all across the country and the seamless partnership that we have forged with them and with state health officials, with our federal team.
I spoke today to Governor Pritzker of Illinois, and we are in continuous communication with governors a phone call away.  They know that they can contact us and address even the smallest need, because as a — as a former governor, I know firsthand that when it comes to health challenges in America, our states are on the ground in the lead, our local health organizations.  And we’ve built a great partnership.
We also want to express great appreciation to the American people.  Not surprisingly, it is inspiring to see the way tens of millions of Americans are responding with compassion, with common sense.  And we want to express particular gratitude to communities of faith that participated in today’s National Day of Prayer.  We’ve seen places of worship implementing policies to keep those most vulnerable safe.  And also, we’re seeing communities of faith already stepping forward to support and to encourage those most vulnerable.
I heard tell of a church back in Indiana that’s actually no longer having services until April 10th, but in the meantime they’ll be offering daycare to the children of healthcare workers in Central Indiana.  And churches all across the country are taking the opportunity to reach out and put feet on their faith, and it’s truly inspiring.
As the President mentioned today, he spoke today to leaders in the grocery store industry and where people buy our food.  And we heard, and we’re reminded, that America has the most efficient and effective supply chain in the world, and it’s working just fine.
As the President said, he received a commitment from those grocery store executives that stores will stay open throughout the days that lie ahead.  We were told that hours may be reduced to allow for cleaning and to resupply, but American families can be confident your local grocery store is going to be open; it’s going to be well supplied.  And they specifically asked us to encourage Americans: Just buy your weekly needs and grocery, because the grocery stores will remain open.
Also, very movingly, those same executives all reiterated their commitment to continue to support local food banks in the way that our grocers continue to do around America.
Tomorrow, the President and I will be briefing all the nation’s governors from states and territories, and the District of Columbia, to be speaking about the progress that we’re making.  And we’ll be speaking to them specifically about our widening partnership on expanding testing to the American people.
So allow me to speak to that issue, and then I’m going to recognize Admiral Brett Giroir, who will describe for us the excellent work the Public Health Service is doing.  Dr. Birx will describe the importance of the new national public-private partnership for diagnostic testing that is going to open the door to thousands of more tests in real time for the American people in the days ahead.
First, some fundamentals.  As the American people know, testing is now available in all 50 states.  Either state labs are either conducting the tests themselves, or the CDC is processing tests.  They’re using the traditional manner of a manual test that allows for 40 to 60 tests a day.
It is among the reasons why the President, several weeks ago, tasked this group at the White House to reach out to commercial labs around the country and forge that public-private partnership that would bring the high-speed — or more accurately, the high-throughput testing for coronavirus available in real time.
And based on the unprecedented speed of the FDA, which last week approved high-throughput coronavirus testings for Roche and Thermo Fisher, we will now have access in the days ahead to more than 2,000 labs across the country that have the equipment today to process coronavirus tests much more rapidly and a much higher volume for the American people.
In terms of delivering those services, more than 10 states — in addition to CDC labs, public health labs, and labs that states can now authorize in their states — more than 10 states have implemented their own drive-through testing sites.  And we want to commend New York, Colorado, Delaware, Washington State, Texas, and others that have implemented these on-site places where people can obtain tests.
Most are using the current CDC testing, the manual testing, but we are working closely with our governors, as you will hear momentarily, to make sure that the new testing regimen is available for their remote sites as well.
As I mentioned, as of Monday, we will have more than 2,000 labs coming online with the high-speed testing, and we are connecting states to those testing methods.
We’re also working with a number of retail partners to add to the work that states are doing around the country, working to set up parking lot testing centers outside of stores.  And Admiral Brett Giroir will detail the progress that we’ve made over the last 72 hours.
Following the President’s declaration of emergency, the Admiral and our Public Health Service have forged a partnership now with FEMA, made possible by that declaration.  And they’ve reached out to all 50 states to create a process that will enable all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community-based testing site outside of usual healthcare facilities.
The focus of these tests, as Dr. Birx will describe momentarily, will be on those most in need.  A priority will be placed on healthcare workers and first responders who are out there coming alongside people that are being impacted by the coronavirus.  We want to make sure they have access to the testing as a priority.
And then, Americans 65 or over with a cough or a fever or other symptoms will be prioritized over other tests that are extended.
As I mentioned, Admiral Giroir will describe the progress that we’ve made in just a few moments, but we’re going to continue to work very diligently — hour by hour, day by day — in the days ahead to expand testing around the country and access to this extraordinary and unprecedented national public-private partnership for diagnostic testing.
With regard to testing: As we expand testing, we’re so pleased that Congress joined with our administration to make sure that cost is never going to be a barrier to anyone getting a coronavirus test.
As you recall, several weeks ago, the President directed a change in our Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure the coronavirus testing was included.  Health insurers were brought in; they all agreed to waive co-pays.  But because of the good bipartisan work done in the House of Representatives, now all coronavirus testing is free, and it’s free for every American, including uninsured Americans.  And we continue to urge passage of the legislation that will be considered by the Senate this week.
Let me say one final word about the testing issue, and that is that we — as the President often says, we’re all in this together.  And it’s absolutely important that as we expand testing resources across the country, beginning by prioritizing the areas that CDC and our state leadership tell us are most important, it’s important that the tests are available for people that are most in need and for our healthcare workers and first responders that are — that are helping them and supporting them.
As Dr. Birx will describe, the testing that is available should only be done if for any reason you think you may have the coronavirus.  We encourage people to consult their doctor.  And if you’re — if you’re symptom-free, we encourage you to work with us to make sure that testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms.
It’s extremely important that we have the continuing cooperation of every American as we expand testing and make it available during this challenging time in the life of our nation.
With that, I’m going to ask Dr. Birx — oh, excuse me, I’m going to ask Admiral Brett Giroir of the Public Health Service and leader of this great Commissioned Corps behind me to come up and describe the extraordinary work that they have done over the last 72 hours and will be doing each and every day, in conjunction with our states, to expand testing to community-based testing across the country for the American people using this new public-private partnership diagnostic testing.
Admiral?
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  And thank you for your personal interest in support of our team over the last 72 hours as we worked on this critically important project.
So as the Vice President said, over the past 72 hours, we have developed and are beginning to implement now a process and a program of testing that will enable Americans who are in need of coronavirus testing to be tested effectively and efficiently according to a few principles:
Number one, we want to assure that those most vulnerable and those impacted are able to be prioritized.
Number two, we don’t want to do testing that in any way threatens the acute care system.  In other words, we don’t want people going to hospitals and acute care clinics where, number one, they could infect other people or subject themselves to infections.
And number three, we want to balance the needs across the entire healthcare system among diagnosis but also treatment.  In other words, we want to balance the stress on the Strategic National Stockpile and all our commodities so that everyone gets all the materials they need.
So what do we do?  Because, as the Vice President said, last week’s historically fast approval of high-throughput testing, we are now in a new phase of testing.  And you’ve heard Dr. Fauci talk about the new phase.
So we’re going from somewhat manual, relatively slow phases, to a testing regimen that we can test many tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals per week and maybe even more.  We will have 1.9 million of these high-throughput tests available this week with numerous labs, up to 2,000, starting to turn the lights on beginning this week and rolling out over the week.  That is really a game-changer for us because the back-of-the-shop testing capability is there.
The front of the shop is what we’ve been really working on.  In order to get a test there, you’ve got to be able to swab individuals, get them into the system without completely paralyzing the entire healthcare system as we know.
So, with the emergency declaration, this was very, very important to us because it really enabled the historically effective processes of working and empowering states — federally supported, state-led efforts — through the normal FEMA mechanisms.
So for the last 72 hours, representatives of FEMA from across the government and our Commissioned Corps have been working on joining the unique and unprecedented public health mission with the historically successful mission of personal — of distribution centers, places for distribution — the pod system of FEMA.
Our Public Health Service — we’ve already deployed over a thousand officers in support of the coronavirus missions.  That includes to the Diamond Princess, to the borders, to the quarantine stations, to the acute care settings where we’re caring for nursing home residents in Seattle.  So we have a very experienced group, and we brought these together.
So what we’ve really designed in how we’re working with the states: We have contacted all 50 states through the FEMA system — every single region, every single state — to understand where they are.
As the Vice President said, some states are rolling out some of their own community-based testing.  They need to be augmented.  We believe we’ve created a model, based on the Public Health and the FEMA system, that is optimized, that can be used for drive-through or potentially walk-through.  Each of these pod-based units, we believe, can screen 2,000 to 4,000 individuals a day for testing, with all the appropriate personal protective gear, all the appropriate backend and linkage to the public health system, including testing.
We know that we have the logistics to do that.  We know we have the materials to do that.  And again, this is federally supported state-led efforts.  Many states need the full meal deal.  They want dozens of Public Health Service officers to work in protective gear to actually test.  They need supplies, like protective gear; they need swabs; they need the logistical supports.  Other states only need a fraction of that.  They may have all the personnel, but they really need the knowhow, the template, and some of the gear that we provide.
We are going to start implementing this system, this week, in a number of states, primarily those that are the hardest hit right now or are on the rise and the CDC advises us that that’s when they need the testing.
I want to emphasize, again, that we’re focusing on two very important groups — and you’ll hear this said three or four different ways — and the groups that really can be the most impacted or impactful in our outbreak.
Number one is healthcare workers and first responders.  This is very important for two reasons.  Number one, we have to take care of the healthcare workers and responders, because when America needs them, they need to be available and healthy to provide the care that we all deserve.  But it’s also important that if they feel they have a risk of having contacted [sic] coronavirus, that we test them so they cannot spread that, for example, in long-term care facilities where the elderly are.
And the second group would be the elderly.  And we are classifying that, according to risk, is those 65 years of age or older who have a respiratory symptom and a fever of 99.6.  That’s a lower number than you’ve seen before because those who are older do not spike high fevers, like children do — 104, 105.  So you set the bar just a little bit lower.
We do that because we know that they’re at high risk of bad consequences.  And if they test positive, they could engage with their practitioner, telehealth provider, or get in the system to make sure they have just an outstanding outcome.
So that is really where we are.  We’ve made really unprecedented progress.  You will see these sites rolling out progressively over the week.  This is not make-believe.  This is not fantasy.  We’ve developed the model.  We’ve talked to the states.  We’re focusing in on specific locations now.  We will start shipping gear, stuff, tomorrow.  We will start deploying officers tomorrow and Tuesday.  And we’ll begin seeing these sites, in addition to the ones that are springing up now, implemented during this week.
We will have the capability of testing tens of thousands of additional people through these sites every week, in addition to all the capability that’s now going to be distributed in the 2,000 laboratories and the major central, core laboratories.
And I know you have a number of questions that hopefully in the question-and-answer session we’ll be able to answer for you.
But I think this is just a great linkage.  I’m a pediatric ICU doctor.  I take care of sick people.  I know what happens when you get respiratory illness.  The Surgeon General is an anesthesiologist who takes care of people who have respiratory difficulties and manages that.
So we know how this — we know how this works.  We’ve been there.  The most important thing we’ve worked on right now is making testing accessible because of the advances of the FDA and private industry to make these high-throughput tests.  Now we can work on the front end.
With the emergency declaration, we have all the tools, and all of government has really come together with industry, not just government and states.  It’s really been private industry, the manufacturers, to bring the swabs, the personal protective gear, the laboratory testing, the shipping, the fronts with Walgreens and Walmarts working as potential sites.
This has been something, in my mind, that has been unprecedented, the entire society approach working so intensely over the past — certainly over the past weeks, but incredibly on this project over the past 72 hours.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Admiral.  And let me say we are moving out, now that we have the public-private partnership with the major commercial labs.  And now you have our Public Health team as well as FEMA moving out, connecting to the states, to deploy these point-of-distribution community centers.
We’ll also be working closely with members of the media and individual jurisdictions, as well as we’re working with Google and other tech companies to make sure that there’s online resources where people will be able to readily access a questionnaire that will walk them through the symptoms and whether or not a test might be indicated.
And also, in the days ahead, we look forward to that same website being able to direct people to the nearest community center or drive-through center that’s available.
But let me — me let me introduce Dr. Deborah Birx to speak about that — that patient experience — and about the importance of the right people seeking the testing in the days ahead.
Doctor?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Let me just start by recognizing the men and women of the military who are serving us every day.  They are my brothers and sisters.  I was privileged to serve alongside them for quite a long time.
But, critically, I just want to recognize at this moment the Public Health Commissioned Corps behind me.  The Vice President — although he didn’t speak to this — actually went to see them yesterday at the place where they were working, so that we wouldn’t disturb them, because of their level of dedication and work through the last, really, 48 hours non-stop.
So, thank you.  Thank you for your work, and thank you for the work that you brought together.  And thank you, Admiral, for explaining it so quickly.
Let me just go back to the way laboratory work is done in the United States.  I think all of you know, when you go to your doctor, and you need a lab test, it is either done in your doctor’s office, or it’s done in the lab that they send you to.
When we started this emergency response to this virus, we started with what we knew, and that was the flu platform that we use for surveillance.  It wasn’t set up in your doctor’s office.  It wasn’t set up in our hospital laboratories.  It was set up in state and local labs and at the CDC.
Over the last two weeks, we’ve been working with the groups that have served you for decades — the commercial laboratories that you don’t see, but your specimen goes to — to ensure they had the full capacity to meet the needs of the American people. Because it wasn’t going to be 50 to 100 to 1,000 tests; it was going to be tens of thousands of tests that would be needed to be done.
And so, the last two weeks has been spent on really getting what you are used to: the full force of the clinical laboratories and service.
At the same time, what you heard described here is how do we serve the needs of the people in the community where they reside; where we know when we’re talking about people with vulnerable conditions, immunosuppression medical conditions, or the elderly, that we don’t want them having to sit for long times in doctor’s office and hospitals’ waiting rooms.
And you see what state and local governors have done to move past what we would normally do — a referral to your doctor’s office and to your hospital — but really providing community-led services to provide this testing.
What the federal government is doing is augmenting that — augmenting the innovation that existed in South Korea, brought here to the shores of the United States and brought in our own novel way, but utilizing our healthcare delivery system, which is different than South Korea, and adapting our work to our system
So, to the hospitals and to the laboratories: We know that there will be pent-up demand for this.  Make sure every hospital and every laboratory — I’m speaking to my — the people who work in labs, like I did myself.  Make sure you have enough pipette tips, pipettors, and all of the equipment that you need to run this laboratory.
You know what you need.  Make sure you have that and have that available for these tests — because we know with this increased sampling, this increased ability to have community access, additional samples will be going to these laboratories. They can manage the high throughput, but they need all of the supplies that they would normally need to run these tests.  Think of it — if you’re doing HIV viral load, same thing: just what you need.  You know what you need; make sure you have that.  That will be run.
And the most important thing, I know, for each and every one of you is how am I going to get my results.  And so we’re making sure also that the end of reporting is also there; that the reporting is available to you, to your doctor, and also to the state and local governments and the federal government, not with your personal identifiers, but to really understand where there are positives, where there are negatives, so we can ensure that healthcare providers have what they need to meet the demands of the American people and their health needs when they’re there.
Now, let me just say one bit about reporting.  So you will notice, as these tests roll out over this next week, we will have a spike in our curve.  For those of you who watched China and China reporting, remember when they changed their definition and all of a sudden there was a blip in their curve?  We are going to see that.  We are going to see a spike as more and more people have access.
And I want to finish by, again, reminding people how important it is.  I know everybody is going to want to go to these drive-throughs.  But if we could prioritize, like we have asked you to prioritize the care of every person with a preexisting condition and immunosuppression, and the elderly with existing conditions — we’ve asked you to prioritize them and we ask you to prioritize them in the lines, so that our first responders and our healthcare providers and everybody who has difficulty to get to doctors’ offices can utilize this system while we bring all the other traditional systems that you’re used to and have availability for you online over the next few days and weeks.
So, thank you.  Thank you for constantly reminding us how important.  It’s a response of all of America for Americans.  All of America for Americans.  It’s a privilege to be part of this solution and be part of this team.
And again, I want to close by recognizing the Commissioned Corps.  They have spent — I’m not sure they had anything but pizza to eat for the last two days, but we appreciate grat- —
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Donuts.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Apples and bananas.  Apples and bananas.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Donuts.
(Laughter.)
DR. BIRX:  All right, don’t follow their guidance.  (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I’ll be very brief.  I just want to say, listening to the description of Admiral Giroir, I’m very pleased to see how things have evolved.  I think we could describe this as entering into a new phase in the testing space available here in the United States.
You’ve heard me, on many of these briefings, talk about the multifaceted armamentarium that we have to address the crisis of what the world is seeing and the challenge that we’re seeing right here in the United States.
I mean, obviously, the travel restrictions have been, in my mind, a very, very positive way that we have prevented more of the input from outside in that would seat us and make our job more difficult.
And then we have, as I mentioned, the containment and the mitigation from within.  You’re going to be hearing more about advanced guidelines about that, more precise instructions of how we can implement this mitigation within the community.
But now that we have a situation that is going to be rolled out — and remember, I want to emphasize what was just said: We’re not going to go from here to there overnight.  It’s going to be a gradual ratcheting up that I believe is going to happen quickly so that then we can start talking about things and put behind us the multiple understandable questions about testing and move on to see how we can make this multifaceted approach really work for us.  Because as I’ve said many times, and I’ll repeat it: The worst is, yes, ahead for us.  It is how we respond to that challenge that’s going to determine what the ultimate endpoint is going to be.
We have a very, very critical point now.  If you look at the curves that I’ve described multiple, multiple times, this window that we’re in is going to be very important for us to stay ahead of this curve.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doc.  Stay close.

12:19 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much.  We just completed a very good meeting of the Coronavirus Task Force.  And we — we’re really — they’re really doing a great job, our professionals.  The results are very — very, very good.  And when you compare this to what’s happening around the world, we’re very proud of our people.
And there’s been a tremendous amount of coordination with states, with cities, and they’re a little smaller form of government, and they have things going well.  They’re coordinating with us.  And certain, in particular, I think California has been terrific — the relationship.  New York has been really good.  We’ve had some really good relationships in terms of — especially the hotspots.  And we’re focused on those hotspots.  In some areas, we don’t have no problem whatsoever, and we hope to keep it that way.
Before I turn this over to our great Vice President to provide an update, I just want to express my appreciation for the hard work done by the people behind me and the people back in the various offices, including the fact that I just left the Oval Office.  So we have some people there that are probably watching this or they’re just working.  We’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus, and that’s what we’ve been doing.
Last week, we secured an initial $8.3 billion from Congress for the coronavirus, and that was quickly done and very efficiently done.  And I want to thank all members of Congress.
Yesterday, I declared a national emergency, which was a very big deal because it opened up avenues that we would never be able to open up without it.  And it will make it more than — it will make more than $50 billion available to us immediately in disaster relief funds.  And that’s available for states, territories, and local governments.  So that was really, really good.
We also reached an agreement yesterday on a new legislative package that will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus.  So it was done very, very bipartisan.  It was — it was very nice to see it.  Probably the cooperation — I want to thank Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, who did a fantastic job and worked with Nancy Pelosi and their representatives.  And it was really great.  It worked out very well.
And a lot of people are benefitting by a lot of — a lot of provisions in the bill, which they’re going to be discussing with you today.  And the tremendous provision.  So that’s something that we should talk about.
I was honored to see that the stock market — you were mostly there with us — set a record in a short period of time — over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden.  That was a record.  All-time record.  I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps.  How about every — how about five times a day?  We’ll do one five times a day.  But that was something to watch.  And I had no idea.  We walked back, I said, “So how did that work out?”  They said, “Sir, you just set a new record in the history of the stock market.”  So that was pretty good.
And those great companies that were there, they couldn’t have been too unhappy either, when you think about it, because they’re all very big, publicly listed companies.  So they did a good job.  And more importantly, they’re going to do a good job.  When you look at CVS and Walmart, and all of the tremendous people that were there yesterday, these are the biggest and the best.  And they’re opening up their facilities.  They’re opening up — they’re, right now, literally, working right now on opening — doing something that’s never been done before, to the extent that we’re doing it.  And so we’re very proud of them also.
The bill provides for free coronavirus testing for all Americans who should be tested.  So people that are getting tested are getting this free.  They don’t have to pay — because a lot of people said, “Gee, it’s a lot of money.”  And it is.  It’s a — you know, it’s a pretty complex test actually, and it costs money.  And it’s being provided free, so people don’t have to worry about that.
It also provides paid sick and family medical leave for those who need it, including for those who have the virus, for caregivers, and those looking after children affected by school closures.  So that’s all taken care of also.  And we’ll continue all of these different actions.  We have other things planned.
We’re going to also be working with companies that are affected financially.  Our country is in the best financial shape.  We’ve — it’s so different than in the past, over the years.  If you look at some of the real big crises we had, it was financial problems and different things.  We now are in very, very strong financial shape with all of the trade and all of the other things that we’ve been doing.  It’s been pretty amazing.
We hope the Federal Reserve will finally get on board and do what they should do, because we’re doing things that they should be doing, frankly.  And we can all do them together, but they should be much more proactive.  Other boards and other countries and people representing those countries are taking a much more aggressive action than our Fed, for the most part.
So we’d like to see the — you know, if you look at central banks — yesterday, what they did — we want to see our Federal Reserve be much more proactive.  It’s important.  But in the meantime, we’re doing things that — that are — that have been really well received.  Now, I guess you saw that yesterday at the end of the day with what we’ve done.
We have a lot of things to tell you, in terms of respirators, in terms of all of the different things.  The masks are being made by the millions.  Millions and millions.  We have plenty now, but we’re ordering for the millions.  We’re ordering worst-case scenario.  Always — we always say “worst-case scenario.”  And that’s where we’re going.  So I just want to thank everybody.
I think the press has been really — over the last 24 hours, I think the representation has really been very fair.  For the most part, been very fair.
We’re all in this together.  It’s something that nobody expected.  It came out of China, and it’s one of those things that happened.  It’s nobody’s fault.  We all — we all will solve this problem; we’ll solve it well.
I think the American people have been incredible in the way they’ve acted.  There’s been — and if you look at companies and sports leagues and all of the things, what they’ve done is — is just something very special, without being told, necessarily.  In some cases, perhaps they were told, actually.  But for the most part, they want to get it over with.  They want to get it over with quickly and with very little death.
As of this moment we have 50 deaths, which is — a lot of good decisions were made, or that number could be many times that.  But that’s based on a lot of good decisions, one or two in particular.  You know that Europe was declared the hotspot yesterday, a big hotspot and number one.  And we — we made a decision quite a bit prior to that, but we saw what was happening.
But if you have any questions, this group will be very happy to do it.  But I just want to say they have been — led by Mike Pence — they have been incredible, the job they’re doing.  They’re working 20 hours a day.  This man is working 20 hours a day or maybe more.  Is it more?  I think it’s more.  Tony has been working — I’m just looking at this whole group.  And we’ve created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me.  I watched him the other day.  It was such a fantastic job you did, and I really appreciate it.
But they’re going to be answering questions.  And we have a lot of new information, so I think you’ll find it very interesting.  And I’ll be going back to the Oval Office.
Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

5:43 P.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  We’ve just completed today’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and I couldn’t be more proud of the efforts of the men and women standing behind me or all of those standing behind them.
President Trump said from early on that this would be a whole-of-government approach.  And today gives evidence of the fact that it is also a whole-of-America approach.  We’re bringing the full resources of the federal government and the full resources of — of this great economy and our great business sector to bear in protecting the American people and protecting American families.
A few updates from today: As we continue to expand testing availability across the country — testing is now available at all state labs.  By the end of this week, there will be more than 4 million more tests made available in jurisdictions around the country; 1 million are already in place.  And thanks to the good work of our top commercial labs that the President Trump brought together yesterday, LabCorp and Quest are in the process now of distributing and marketing coronavirus tests all across America.  And we’re working with state local officials to ensure that that happens as rapidly as possible.
But as the testing is expanding, we wanted to make sure the American people knew that testing was available to them and that cost would not be a barrier.
Today, President Trump assembled the top health insurance executives in America.  And, as we announced earlier today, all of our major health insurance companies have now joined with Medicare and Medicaid and agreed to waive all co-pays; cover the cost of all treatment for those who contract the coronavirus; they’ve committed to no surprise billing; and they’ve committed to encourage telemedicine.
It was a year ago that Medicaid actually expanded to pay for telemedicine.  Medicare pays for telemedicine.  So now, for seniors who may think that they are either at risk or have contracted the disease, they can get medical advice without having to go to the doctor or go to an emergency room.
I know I speak for President Trump when I say how grateful we are to see our health insurance industry step forward to meet this need so that — that no American should be concerned about — about being able to pay for or afford the cost of a coronavirus test if they deem and their doctor deems it to be appropriate and necessary.
The President also went to Capitol Hill today to meet with members of the United States Senate Republican caucus.  There, he talked about an economic package, including a call — he’s calling for payroll tax relief.  And I think, most important to the President’s heart, we want to make sure that hourly workers — hardworking, blue-collar Americans that may not have paid family leave today — that small- and medium-sized businesses in America would be afforded the resources to provide paid leave so that no one would feel that they have to go to work if they might be infected or if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.
We had a good reception on Capitol Hill.  Our legislative teams have fanned out.  We’re going to be working with Republican and Democrat leadership to move an economic package.  Larry Kudlow will be reflecting on that in just a few moments.
We also talked about what are known as N95 masks and we’re working — Senator Deb Fischer and others have important legislation that would extend temporary liability protections so that masks that are made for industrial use could be sold to hospitals to ensure that our healthcare workers are properly protected and outfitted.  And we’re grateful for growing bipartisan support for that measure, and we’re going to be working earnestly with Republicans and Democrats to move a reform that would make more N95 masks available.
I’m also pleased to report that we did receive, this afternoon, a comprehensive proposal from the cruise line industry — a proposal that includes advanced screening, improving medical services on ships, providing for airlift evacuation and land-based care at the expense of the cruise lines for anyone that might be not only infected with the coronavirus, but with any serious illness.  We’ll be reviewing that in the next 24 hours.  The President’s objective is for us to make cruise lines safer, even as we work with the cruise lines to ensure that — that no one in our particularly vulnerable population is — is going out on a cruise in the near future.
I’m going to recognize Dr. Fauci to talk about where we are.
And Dr. Birx will give us some research that she’s done on the scope.  We’ll have other updates.  But let me say once again: This is a whole-of-government approach and from early on, President Trump has insisted that our — that our government at the federal level, all of our partners at the state level work in concert to protect the American people.
And, as we stand here today, the risk to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low, but we’re absolutely determined to give every American the tools and the information that they need to protect themselves, their families, their — their workplace, their schools.  And — and we’re going to work together.  We’re going to work together to see our way through this.  And — and working with leaders in both parties in Congress, working with — with leaders at the state level all across this nation, I’m confident we will.
With that, Dr. Tony Fauci for an update on the status.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  Just to give you a very brief sketch of what we do every day: The cases continue to increase globally.  We’re parti- — paying particular attention to the cases in Europe in Italy and France, in which we’re starting to see that up at the same time as the relative number of new cases come down from China.  What we’re seeing in Europe is that Europe is in that upslope.  So that’s something that is expected.  That’s the way these kinds of outbreaks go.  This is not a surprise to anybody if you look at the history of infectious diseases outbreaks.
In the United States, we continue to have new cases.  As of this morning, there was 712, I believe, with 27 deaths.  Guaranteed, by the time of this evening, that’s going to be up and there’ll be several more.  And tomorrow, there’ll be several more.
So we realize that this is something obviously that we’ve been saying all along that we’re taking very seriously.  Now, the question is, what are we going to do about that?  And there are a number of things that one can do in order to blunt it.  If you look at the curves of outbreaks — you know, they go big peaks and then they come down.  What we need to do is flatten that down.  That would have less people infected; that would ultimately have less deaths.  You do that by trying to interfere with the natural flow of the outbreak.
So what we’re saying today is that although we keep coming in and saying, appropriately, that as a nation, the risk is relatively low, there are parts of the country right now that are having community spread in which the risk there is clearly a bit more than that.  And you know the places: you know, Washington State, California, New York, and Florida.
But what I want to talk to you about today, just for a moment or two, is that we would like the country to realize that, as a nation, we can’t be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago.  That it doesn’t matter if you’re in a state that has no cases or one case, you have to start taking seriously what you can do now.  That if and when the infections will come — and they will come.  Sorry to say, sad to say they will.  But when you’re dealing with an infectious disease — you know, we always have that metaphor that people talk about that Wayne Gretzky, you know, he doesn’t go where the puck is, he’s going where the puck is going to be.  Where we want to be: where the infection is going to be, as well as where it is.
So what we have here — if you could see that here what — is here is that if you go to Coronavirus.gov — remember when Dr. Birx, yesterday, mentioned some of the things that we put together?  These are really simple: keeping the workplace safe, keeping the home safe, keeping the school safe, and keeping commercial establishments safe.  This should be universal for the country.  Everyone should be doing that, whether you live in a zone that has community spread or not.  When you have community spread, you obviously are going to ratchet up the kinds of mitigations that you have.  But at a minimum, this is the minimum that we should be doing.  So everybody should say, “All hands on deck.  This is what we need to do.”
So I’ll stop there and later I’ll be happy to answer questions.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Dr. Fauci, for that clarity.  We continue to monitor the situation across the country and across the globe.  And we are very fortunate — between Dr. Fauci and I, we have long-term contracts out there in many of these countries that are experiencing current outbreaks.
We continue to review all the scientific literature to look for insights and to really determine who’s at the greatest risk.  And that’s why we’ve talked to you about people with immunodeficiencies at any age, people with medical conditions, and the elderly, and how important it is all of us to take these precautions in the household to protect others because we have circulating flu and other respiratory diseases at this time.
We all have to act like all of those diseases — any respiratory disease can be transmitted to others.  And as we said yesterday, we’re hoping that decreases all the respiratory disease we’re experiencing.
Finally, we got new reports out of China, who had nine pregnant women during an acute COVID infection and all nine were infected.  Both — and they delivered while they were infected and all nine babies were healthy and the mothers were healthy.  So we continue to look for data like that to be reassuring to the American public.  At the same time, ensuring that every single person is participating in this response to this virus and taking those precautions that we should be taking every day.
If we start doing this today, we will be ready next year for any of our respiratory diseases because I think we’ll be able to show that these simple — simple household, simple work, simple school, simple business approaches across the country can change all of our respiratory diseases.
So we thank you for getting the message out.  We thank you for the participating and ensuring in your households and in households around America that we’re protecting all of those who need our support right now.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Excellent.  Thank you, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci.  And this information is available at Coronavirus.gov.
And as we said, we can’t say often enough, the risks of contracting the coronavirus to the average American remains low.  But for senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions, the potential for serious consequences is very real.  And make no mistake about it, by practicing these habits in your home, your school, and your business, you’re not only protecting your health, but you’re also protecting those that are most vulnerable.
With that, for an update on our — the progress that President Trump made today with our health insurance companies, I’d like to recognize Seema Verma.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  As the Vice President said, we had a terrific meeting with the insurance companies, a real example of a public-private partnership where they agreed to waive co-pays for testing, not do any surprise billing, and also cover the costs of the COVID virus associated costs.
The other things that they did is they asked the President for more flexibility in Medicare Advantage plans and the President agreed to do that.  And so today, we issued guidance to our Medicare Advantage plans that not only can they waive the costs for the tests, but they can also go further to removing prior author- — authorization requirements.  They can waive prescription refill limits.  They can allow for mail delivery of prescription drugs and expand more access to telehealth services if they weren’t offering that in their plan.
Also, at CMS, we continue to work with healthcare providers around infection control practices.  We met with home health agencies and also hospitals, and today we issued guidance to dialysis facilities, as well as home health agencies around infection control.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  There’s been a great deal of attention about the Grand Princess.  And HHS, working with the Coast Guard and with the Department of Defense, is currently working through disembarking American passengers, returning foreign nationals to their country.  And I wanted to ask Secretary Azar to speak and update us on the progress.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you.  So with regard to the Grand Princess, I wanted to first express our appreciation to Governor Newsom, to the Mayor of Oakland, the people of Oakland, the longshoremen, the stevedores who’ve helped with bringing it in and clearing the — clearing the dock area so that we can do all of our operations there.  We’ve got Admiral Abel here with us today, who’s been leading the Coast Guard efforts.  And then Deputy Secretary Biegun from State has done incredible work with our foreign partners to help with the repatriation of their nationals who are on board the ship.
As of — our data that I’ve got is as of noon, Pacific Time, today.  So this will have increased quite substantially since — since my last update.  But as of noon, Pacific, we had 548 individuals who have been offloaded from the ship.  Two hundred and twenty-eight Canadians are already back in Canada — flown there, I believe it was overnight.  A hundred and seventy-one Californians were taken by the government of California and are now at Travis — Travis Air Base.  Twenty-six individuals were sick, and they’re being — they are being treated for various — it could be from the novel coronavirus, it could also just be we had some frail individuals who are sick that needed treatment.
Our goal is to get all of the citizens of California off today to be in the care of the California State Government, as well as to get the UK citizens off today so that they could be repatriated to the United Kingdom.  We continue to work with other countries on all of those maneuvers.  We will have non-California residents who will be in transport to the bases at Dobbins and at Lackland today, we hope, but — or tonight.
So everything is progressing.  It seems to be progressing well.  We’re using the highest isolation quarantine procedures, medical screenings possible to ensure the safety of not just the passengers but also of the local communities and all of the healthcare workers and others — emergency responders who are helping.  So thanks to all of our partners for this — their help with this very complex operation.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well done.  Good report.  And let me echo the Secretary’s appreciation to Governor Gavin Newsom, the State of California, the City of Oakland.  It has literally been a seamless partnership.  Everyone on that ship will be tested, isolated, and quarantined as appropriate and provided with treatment.  The crew on the ship, other than those who were ill, will be quarantined on the ship offshore.  But it really represented the kind of partnership and cooperation from every level of government that — that every American, I know, is grateful to see.
With that, on the economic front: Larry Kudlow.
MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.  All right, yesterday, in a meeting in the Oval, the President — acknowledging there are going to be challenges on the health and economic side, he mentioned that he intended to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these challenges.  And accordingly, as the Vice President said, up at the Republican Senate luncheon today — and he mentioned it in this room yesterday — President Trump has unveiled his proposals — strong proposals — for a temporary payroll tax cut holiday, which I think he would prefer to last through the end of the year.
Also, administratively, as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and others have suggested, we are trying to — we will use assistance to unpaid sick leave people — a very important point; also small and medium businesses — another important point.  And also, possibly, to some distressed industries or sectors in the economy, maybe tax deferral might be a useful tool and other means.
So this is strong, across-the-board package.  We are consulting with leaders in the House and the Senate, with respect to this package and particularly the payroll tax holiday.
Let me just say, coming into this difficult period, the economy is in fundamentally in good shape.  We saw a blockbuster jobs report last Friday.  Today, for example, the Small Business Confidence Index — the NFIB Business Confidence Index registered a very strong number, keeping its near-record high.  The unemployment remains low at 3.5 percent.  Other indicators look pretty good.  We had a lot of momentum in the first quarter.  Good thing.
I recognize the challenges and that is why we are proposing these fiscal measures to combine with monetary measures that have already taken.
And again, I will repeat the President’s words — it just struck me, as his determination — he intends to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these health and economic challenges.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Larry.  Well said.  And a word from Surgeon General Jerome Adams.  General.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Good evening, everyone.  As Surgeon General, whether it’s opioids or cigarettes or the coronavirus, my job is to help the American people understand how to live a healthy life.  And I’m asking all of you — I’m imploring all of you to help share my prescription for America to overcome this coronavirus situation that we’re in.
There are three parts to it. Number one: Know your risk.  As you’ve heard many times but it’s still important to impress upon America: If you are immunocompromised, if you have chronic medical conditions, if you are over the age of 60, you are at higher risk.  If you are a child or young adult, you are less likely to be impacted by the coronavirus.
Number two — the second part of the prescription: Know your circumstances.  Are you in an environment where you can telework? Are you planning on going to large gatherings like church?  Do you live in a community that is being particularly impacted by the coronavirus?  And you can find out this information from your state or local health department.  Does your state have a hotline that you can call into to help you assess symptoms?  Again, knowing your circumstances.
And number three, and this is the most important part: Know what you can do to stay safe.  And we have really leaned into Coronavirus.gov.  Please send people to that website.  We’ve put the tools on there for individual groups, specific audiences, so that people can understand how to stay — stay safe.  If we follow this prescription, we will — we will overcome the coronavirus.
As Dr. Fauci said, we will see more cases.  Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths.  We have not hit the peak of this epidemic quite yet, but if we follow this prescription, then we will decrease the number of people who are impacted, we will decrease the number of people who will die, and we will more quickly get to the end of this situation.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Great job.  Questions?  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force/

6:34 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  We just attended a very important task force meeting on the virus that everybody is talking about all over the world.  No matter where you go, that’s what’s on people’s minds.  And we are going to take care of, and have been taking care of, the American public and the American economy.
We are going to be asking tomorrow — we’re seeing the Senate.  We’re going to be meeting with House Republicans — Mitch McConnell, everybody — and discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief — very substantial relief.  That’s a big — that’s a big number.
We’re also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they’re not going to ever miss a paycheck.  We’re going to be working with companies and small companies, large companies — a lot of companies — so that they don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.  It’s not their fault, it’s not our country’s fault.
This was something that we were thrown into and we’re going to handle it, and we have been handling it very well.  The big decision was early when we shut down our borders.  We’re the first ones ever to do that.  We’ve never done that in our country before.  Or we’d have a situation that would be a lot more dire.
Also, we’re going to be seeing Small Business Administration and creating loans for small businesses.  We’re also working with the industries, including the airline industry, the cruise ship industry — which, obviously, will be hit.  We’re working with them very, very strongly.  We want them to travel.  We want people to travel to certain locations and not to other locations at this moment.  And hopefully that will straighten out sooner rather than later.  But we’re working with the industries, and in particular those two industries.
We’re also talking to the hotel industry.  And some places, actually, will do well, and some places probably won’t do well at all.  But we’re working also with the hotel industry.
But the main thing is that we’re taking care of the American public, and we will be taking care of the American public.
And I really appreciate the professionals behind me and the professionals actually behind them, in a different room.  We have a tremendous team, and it’s headed up by our great Vice President, Mike Pence.  And I want to thank Mike because he’s been working 24 hours a day, just about.  He has been working very, very hard, very diligently, and very professionally.  And I want to thank him, and I want to thank the team.  And I’ll have Mike say a few words.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Mike?  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We just completed the day’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  We had the opportunity to brief the President today on a broad range of issues.
And once again, because of the unprecedented action that President Trump took in January — suspending all travel from China; establishing travel advisories for portions of South Korea and Italy; establishing screening of all direct flights, all passengers from all airports from Italy and South Korea — we have — we have bought a considerable amount of time, according to all the health experts, to deal with the coronavirus here in the United States.
In fact, as I stand before you today, the risk of contracting the coronavirus to the American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low.
With that being said, the President did deploy not just a whole-of-government approach, but also a whole-of-America approach.  And last week, at the President’s direction, we met with leaders in industries, from nursing homes to airlines, pharmaceutical companies, commercial labs, and it’s had great, great impact.
Pharmaceutical companies are already working, literally around the clock, on the development of therapeutics; that will be medicines that can bring relief to people that contract the coronavirus.  And I know how pleased the President was to learn that the commercial labs in this country, led by companies like LabCorp and Quest, have already brought a test forward and are taking that to market effective today.
This week, at the President’s direction, we’ll be meeting with hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, and all — building on top of what the President will be announcing tomorrow with regard to economic relief for working Americans.
We also met today in a conference call with 47 of America’s governors.  We were able to brief them on the latest — the progress that we’ve made.  We were able to confirm with them that testing is now available in all state labs in every state in the country.  Over a million tests have been distributed.  Before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed.  But as I said before, with the deployment of the commercial labs, we literally — we literally are going to see a dramatic increase in the available — availability of testing, and that’s all a direct result of the President’s leadership.
Today, in a few moments, we will — we will outline community guidance that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci will be publishing.  At President’s direction, we’re going to be providing guidance about how to keep your home safe, how to keep your business safe, how to keep safe and healthy at your school.  And we’ll be publishing that information and speaking about that.
A brief word about the Grand Princess: The Grand Princess has docked this afternoon in Oakland, California, at a commercial dock.  Twenty-five children, we were happy to learn through the screening over the last two days — the 25 children on the ship are all healthy.  Of the people that have contracted the coronavirus — 21 in all — they’re being dealt with in proper isolation.
Working with health authorities in California, we hope before the end of today to begin to disembark California residents to Travis Air Force Base in Miramar.  We’ve made arrangements with Canada and the UK to take their passengers back.  They’ll be transported directly to the tarmac, charter flights home.
And tomorrow, the remaining passengers will be transported, again, through very, very carefully controlled environments — buses out to the tarmac and flown to military bases in Georgia and Texas.
All the passengers will be tested, isolated as appropriate, quarantined as appropriate.  And I want to express appreciation to the Governor of California and his administration, the Governor of Georgia, the Governor of Texas, for their strong cooperation with us in resolving the issues around the Grand Princess.
It has been a — it has been a partnership which the President directed us from the very beginning.  And the process that Bob Kadlec will detail, and any questions in a few moments, continues to work and move forward.
The remaining people on the ship — the crew itself will push off from the dock, and they will be quarantined and observed and treated shipboard.  But the President made the priority to get — to get the Americans ashore, and we’re in the process of doing that, as well as returning the foreign nationals.
Let me just say one other point: As the President has spoken today to congressional leadership, one of the things that I informed the President that I’ve been hearing from governors is the concern about hourly wage earners in this country feeling that they had to go to work, even if they were ill.  And the President has tasked this economic team, and is working already with leaders in the Congress, to make sure that anyone is not — feels that they’re at risk of losing their job or losing a paycheck because they may contract the coronavirus.
When we tell people, “If you’re sick, stay home,” the President has tasked the team with developing economic policies that will make it very, very clear that we’re going to stand by those hardworking Americans, stand by those businesses large and small, and make it possible for us, as the President said from the very beginning, to put the health of America first.
We’ll be available to take any questions on any of these topics, but, Mr. President, I didn’t know if you wanted to speak a few more, in closing.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think what we will be doing is having a news conference tomorrow to talk about various things that we’re doing economically — there’ll be very major — including, obviously, the payroll tax cut.
And so we’ll be meeting again tomorrow afternoon.  We’ll be coming back from the Senate, and we have a lot of very important meetings set up.  And we’ll have a press conference sometime after that, and we’ll explain what we’re doing on an economic standpoint and from an economic standpoint.  But they will be very — very dramatic.  And we have a great economy, we have a very strong economy, but this came — this blindsided the world.  And I think we’ve handled it very, very well.  I think they’ve done a great job.  The people behind me have done a great job.
So I will be here tomorrow afternoon to let you know about some of the economic steps we’re taking, which will be major.  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. We just completed today’s lengthy meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and, at the President’s direction, have continued to implement his whole-of-government approach to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear to confront the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
Let me begin, as always, by saying that according to all the experts gathered here and on our task force, the risks of the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low. But that being said, we’re continuing to lean into this effort in full partnership with state and local health authorities around the country to ensure that we do everything to prevent the spread of the disease, to mitigate its expansion, and to provide necessary treatment to Americans that have been impacted.
But first, let me turn my attention — before we speak about some of our broader efforts and hear from some members of the task force — to an issue that I know is on the hearts and minds of people across the country. The Grand Princess cruise ship has been moored off the coast of California since Wednesday night. I want to commend the efforts of our Coast Guard that heroically flew coronavirus tests to the ship. And we received those results.
Working in close consultation with Governor Gavin Newsom and the state of California, we have developed a process for addressing our findings and resolving the circumstances facing Americans and people from around the world and the crew on the Grand Princess.
First the results: Among those tested, 46 persons were swabbed, 21 of those on the ship tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 tested negative, 1 test was inconclusive. Again, let me say: Twenty-one — twenty-one individuals on the Grand Princess tested positive. Among those were 19 crewmembers and 2 passengers. And it’s important —","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-3/

GOVERNOR INSLEE: Welcome to Washington State. We’ve just finished very productive meetings with the Vice President. We in Washington are very appreciative of him being here today. He not only helped us with some issues today in our partnership with the federal government, but he has already helped us in recently removing some federal restrictions that would have made it more difficult to have testing for the coronavirus, which we appreciate.
We had very helpful meetings, talking about our ability to increasing the testing capacity for the virus in the United States. We had some great discussions about some of our unemployment compensation issues to help more people who might be quarantined to be able to have assistance. We had discussions about the ability to have additional surge capacity in our medical delivery system and our ability to have immediate help from the federal government with one of our nursing homes and other capacity.
And I think that he has been very remarkably adept at fielding our inquiries, and I know he’s going to go back and help to continue this effort.
I also want to compliment his agency directors, who have been assistance as much personally to me, giving us some additional scientific information. So I think we have a good partnership between the state of Washington and the federal government, and I’m very appreciative of him being here in such short order. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks, Governor Inslee. And to your outstanding healthcare team — Dr. Wiesman — it is good to be here. Washington State is on the frontlines of the coronavirus in America, and the people of Washington State should be proud of your state and local leadership, the healthcare leadership, the first responders. The way you’ve come alongside families that have been impacted has really represented the very best standard of care. And all of America’s hearts are with the people of Washington State today.
Governor Inslee, as I told you, President Trump wanted me to be here to ensure the people of Washington State that we are with you and that the full resources of the federal government will continue to be brought to bear as people across the Seattle area and across Washington State deal with the coronavirus.
I do want to — I do want to commend, Governor Inslee, your team’s effort and the seamless partnership that was forged from the very beginning between our administration and your administration here at the state level.
Dr. Wiesman just informed me that he literally speaks to the head of the CDC every day, multiple times a day. We’ve had personnel on the ground, literally, since the first corona case was detected here in Washington State.
And President Trump wanted me to be here to talk to the people that are on the ground, the emergency center earlier today, to talk to policymakers here to ensure that we continue to provide that level of support.
I’m also pleased to be joined by so many members of Washington’s delegation to the Congress of the United States. The good news was today that the United States Senate passed, as the House of Representatives did yesterday, legislation that will provide nearly $8 billion in support.
And I want to thank these members of Congress for their efforts — swift and bipartisan — exactly what the American people would expect in a moment like this in the life of our nation.
The resources, Governor, as we discussed, are not simply resources for federal agencies, but rather there is also considerable investment available for states, like Washington, that are dealing with the coronavirus and also local healthcare providers. And we’re truly grateful for their efforts.
We have, as the Governor just said, forged a strong partnership between the federal government and the state government, and we’ll continue to look for ways to strengthen that in the days ahead.
As I stand before you today, at this moment in time, we have at least 150 cases of coronavirus in the United States, including 70 confirmed cases in Washington State. Among the balance of those, some 49 are Americans that we returned home from China and from being on the cruise ship, the Diamond Princess.
And, of course, as we stand here today, our hearts grieve the loss of 12 Americans. And particularly to those families here in Washington State, please know that you have the condolences of every American and you’re on our hearts for your loss.
While the coronavirus has spread in the Seattle area and new cases are detected around the country every day, the good news is that the vast majority of all of those who have contracted the coronavirus are recovering and doing well. The truth is that the risk of contracting the coronavirus to the average American remains low, according to all the health experts that I have here with me today and that are a part of our efforts at the national and state level.
And while there may be more cases detected in this state and around the country as we continue to expand testing, most cases, the experts tell me, will be mild, will have flu-like symptoms, and the Americans will — involved will fully recover.
We have observed — as you have, Governor, here in Washington State — though, that seniors and Americans with underlying health conditions are particularly vulnerable to serious disease, and especially following the heartbreaking loss of life at the nursing home in Kirkland. But we’ve taken action to address that, just as you have here in Washington State.
The Director of the Center for Medicaid [Medicare] and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, is with me today. And this week, at President Trump’s direction, we raised the standards for all nursing homes in America with regard to guidelines for preventing the spread of infectious disease. And also at the President’s direction, all 8,000 of our inspectors at CMS nationwide will be focusing all of their inspection efforts at nursing homes on compliance with federal standards for preventing the spread of infectious disease. We want to make every effort to ensure that our seniors and our nursing homes are as safe as possible from the spread of the coronavirus.
And on the subject of testing, we’ve been making steady progress. And I was encouraged to hear, Governor, that — that CDC has been able to provide kits to Washington State to meet your demand. But we know that while — while we’re meeting the demand of cases we know about today, we still have a ways to go to ensure the tests are available for any future cases and also for people across your state and across the country that may be concerned that they had contracted the coronavirus and want to obtain a test.
But I’m happy to report and have you confirm that the CDC has prioritized the delivery of coronavirus test kits to Washington State and to California. And I can assure you, Governor, we will continue to do so.
But by the end of next week, CDC’s test supplier — a company known as IDT — will distribute kits across the country that will enable roughly 1.2 million Americans to be tested for the coronavirus. Those kits will be delivered in just a matter of a few days. By the end of next week, another 4 million tests will be available. But it’s still just a beginning.
As our nation continues to hear of new cases every day, we want to make sure that testing is available broadly. And to that end, President Trump brought together the leaders of the top commercial labs in the country. As we speak, at the President’s urging, they have formed a consortium, and we’ll be working with the leading commercial labs in America who tell us that, in a matter of weeks, through validation efforts that we’ll do through the FDA, they could well be in a position where, in the not-distant future, your doctor, your local pharmacy, your local MedCheck will have access to a coronavirus.
We have a ways to go, but President Trump said early on that we would bring a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, and we have. But as the President met this week with the leaders of commercial laboratories, with the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, with leaders of other industries, the truth is: We’re bringing the whole-of-America approach to this and American businesses are stepping up in new and in renewed ways to make sure that we have the resources, including the testing and the development of therapies and, ultimately, in a year and a half, we hope, the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. And every American should be grateful for that.
With regard to the tests themselves, once again, CMS has already made the changes necessary that — that a coronavirus test is today now eligible for coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. And we’ll be working with these members of Congress to ensure that coronavirus testing is included as an essential health benefit and therefore is covered by all the private insurance in the country as well.
There may still be gaps. We’ll work with policymakers to ensure that the coronavirus is available for anyone who is concerned or suspected to have been exposed. But we’re making great progress in ensuring that this — that this test is available broadly to people across the country.
For up-to-date information on the status of the coronavirus, on best practices for preventing its spread, keeping your own health and your family’s health secure, you can go to coronavirus.gov for the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control.
Our message to families all across the state of Washington is simply this: We’re with you. We are here to help. And we’re going to stay with you every step of the way until the state of Washington and America sees our way through the coronavirus.
We are making progress. As I mentioned, federal assistance was approved by the United States Senate. President Trump is expected to sign the legislation tomorrow as he visits the CDC in Atlanta.
In that same spirit, I’m grateful to report that, on Air Force Two today, through the efforts of HHS, Governor, we’ve delivered 100,000 N95 respirators, over 100,000 surgical masks, more than 2,500 face shields, and thousands of disposable gowns and gloves to assist in making those resources available.
And also, we’re truly grateful that a leading research company made more than 200 doses of an experimental therapeutic medication available for people that are struggling and having severe difficulty with coronavirus. And we have a commitment that those medicines will continue to be made available on a daily basis.
With that, I’d like to introduce the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Bob Redfield, for the latest information and your best counsel to the people of the state of Washington.
DR. REDFIELD: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. First, what I would like to say is that I am really grateful to be here to express CDC’s appreciation for the dedication and efforts of the public health community and the people here in Washington as you begin to confront and continue to confront this outbreak.
I would also want to underscore what’s important to all the citizens of this state. I want them to have great confidence in the judgment and leadership of their governor and their health department.
Right now, the state of Washington is really — as the Vice President said, it’s the tip of the spear. And we are all here to commit CDC’s full support to assist you and work together to confront the challenges that this brings.
We implemented, at the beginning, very aggressive public health measures together to try to slow the spread in our country. You’re now at a stage where we’re beginning to see community transmission. And I just want to say, again, that it’s a privilege that we have, at CDC, to be able to partner with, really, the strongest public health system that we have in this nation, within the state of Washington.
We need to continue to be committed to the importance of early case recognition. And I want people to realize that when new cases are identified, that’s actually a success, not a failure. It shows that your public health community is out there doing their job with isolation and contact tracing.
And as we have one of the challenges to understand how do you really understand how to impact this virus for individuals that don’t actually have symptoms, I will argue one of the most important ways to do that is practice public health and do early case recognition, isolation, and contact tracing. It’s through the contact tracing that you’re going to begin to identify that group.
I also just want to finish by saying that we’re here, in partnership with your health department, to actually learn — because this state is now, as I said, the tip of the spear as we begin to reinforce those control measures that we just talked about for containment, but begin now to implement different mitigation strategies in the population.
And I’ll close by just re-echoing what the Vice President said: that the overall risk of coronavirus to the American public at this point is low. We’re here to work in partnership to help the state of Washington begin to effectively continue to address, as we confront, the community spread that’s here.
And again, I want the individual citizens of this state to recognize and have the confidence that they have, in my view, the best public health community in our nation to lead this effort.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Governor Inslee, as the President said, we’re all in this together. And I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to spend time with your team, to have the opportunity to spend time with Mayor Durkan, with King County officials, to hear a report from the ground.
We have — we have a ways to go, but I know we’ll get there together, and I know that we will — we will continue to build on this seamless partnership between the national government, your administration here in the state of Washington, and all the extraordinary health officials, healthcare providers, and first responders that, each and every day, in the weeks leading up to today, have been there for the people in this community.
As the President likes to say, this is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we’ll continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to support your efforts in the Seattle area and across the state of Washington. And we’ll get through this together.
Thank you, Governor.
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Will you stand for some questions, Mr. Vice President?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Certainly.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-governor-inslee-press-briefing-tacoma-wa/

1221,Trump,2020-03-04 12:28:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force,Nan,"
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We just completed another meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  It’s been a very busy and productive day here at the White House.
President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and health of the American people.  And the President has directed our task force — employing the full resources of the federal government, in full partnership with state and local health authorities — to make that priority a reality.
As I stand before you today, we have more than 100 coronavirus cases in the United States.  That is counting domestic cases and cases of coronavirus of Americans that were returned from China or the Diamond Princess.  I’m pleased to report that most of those who contracted coronavirus within our care are continuing to recover.  But, sadly, we received word today that another American has passed away and their family has our deepest condolences.
That being said, thanks to the President’s strong leadership and the professionalism of all of our federal agencies — Health and Human Services, CDC — and state and local health officials all across this country, the risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low.
To be clear: If you are a healthy American, the risk of contracting the coronavirus remains low.  But it is still a good idea to engage in commonsense practices that are always recommended this time of year.  So, as someone who has a mother who is 87 years of age, and who has married kids living around the country, a brief tutorial on prevention for yourself, for your family, and your loved ones:
It’s a good idea to stay home when you’re sick.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue; throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently.  Wash your hands with either disinfectant or with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
And let me say again, as we’ve said before: There’s no need for Americans to buy masks.  And the commonsense practices that I just described are all available at CDC.gov.
Today, we — we had a series of meetings here at the White House and on Capitol Hill.  We met with executives of the airline industry, the executives of commercial labs, executives of nursing homes.  And our team also met with the Republican and Democrat caucuses in the House of Representatives.  And we were pleased to learn that, just shortly ago, the House of Representatives passed a federal funding bill by a virtually unanimous margin.  It’ll now move to the Senate.
And the legislation implements the President’s vision to ensure that not only do our federal agencies have the support and resources that they need, but also that our state and local partners have their support.  And in my conversations with governors all the way through this afternoon, I know they’re grateful for the bipartisan spirit that has characterized this funding bill and we’ll continue to work through that process.
As President Trump said, we’re all in this together.  And he deployed a whole-of-government approach, but, thanks to the President’s leadership, it has actually developed into a whole-of-America approach, and the meetings today with industry leaders is a reflection of that.
As Dr. Birx will — will indicate in just a few moments with some of the data that we’re evaluating from around the world, it does appear that the elderly are the most vulnerable and especially those serious health issues.
At the President’s direction, as a result, Seema Verma will describe that the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has issued new guidelines for nursing homes nationwide.  We have raised the bar regarding infectious disease control in our nursing homes.
And in addition, Administrator Verma will explain how we are going to focus all of our inspection resources for the foreseeable future on compliance with infection control standards.
Generally, we — we monitor our nursing homes for abuse and neglect.  But at the President’s direction, we’re going to focus exclusively on ensuring that those who are in nursing homes — people operating the nursing homes, like many of the CEOs that we met with today — are complying with the new standards to keep our elderly safe.
The President also met today with airline executives and I’ll reiterate, as the President said, our profound gratitude to our partners in the airline industry.  They have worked with us in, as we say, flowing Americans through particular airports, the screening.  We’re working very closely with the airlines on contact information. If a person is tested as positive for the coronavirus, we’re working with the airlines to get all the information not just about that person, but about who they sat next to and who else was on the flight.  And the President and I are very grateful.
As we announced yesterday, I’m pleased to report that, as of yesterday morning, in addition to the travel ban from China — we’ve suspended all travel coming in from China, we’ve suspended all travel coming in from Iran, and even foreign nationals who visit either one of those countries are barred from coming into this country for 14 days.
We also established a travel advisory for Italy — portions of Italy and portions of South Korea over the weekend.  But even as importantly, as of yesterday morning, we fully implemented a screening process.  All direct flights from all airports in South Korea and Italy are now being subject to multiple screens before passengers board to come to the United States of America.
State Department worked very vigorously to bring that about and we’re grateful for the cooperation with the governments of Italy, the governments of South Korea, as well as our airline partners in making that a reality.
Finally, with regard to testing, we had a meeting today that gave us great hope for great progress in the near future on expanding testing across the country.  We have a ways to go yet, and I’m pleased to report, as we’ve been able to convey to state governments — governors around the country — is that, thanks to the good work with the FDA and Dr. Steve Hahn, who is with me here today, now all state laboratories, all university laboratories at the state level, can conduct coronavirus tests without any additional assets or resources from the federal government.  They have the FDA-approved tests; they can conduct the test all across the country in all the states.
Beyond that, as we announced, through the efforts of HHS, 2,500 kits of tests are going out this week that — 2,500 kits including tests has gone out this week.  That’s roughly 1.5 million tests that will be available this week.  We’ll continue to build on that number.
But perhaps most significantly, thanks to Dr. Birx’s efforts and leadership, we brought together, today at the White House, the leaders of all of the largest commercial laboratories in this country — companies like Quest that have vast capabilities, logistics and testing capabilities.  And we were pleased to report today that they have created a consortium to share information and to share resources and literally have told us that, as they go through what is called the “validation process” on testing that, by next week, individual companies will be able to do, as they said to me, thousands of tests of coronavirus if they are needed and required, and many, many multiples more of that in the not-distant future.
Our objective here, as Dr. Birx raised with the task force is we’ve got hospitals in affected areas and those that are requesting that have kits — we’ve got universities and state labs that now can perform the test on a requested basis.  But our objective, ultimately, and as quickly as possible, is to have tests made through these commercial laboratories and commercial providers that your local doctor, your CVS, your MedCheck is able to have a coronavirus test.  And that isn’t there yet; we’re working to make that a reality.
But again, it’s one more example — it’s not just a whole-of-government approach; it’s a whole-of-America approach.  And whether it be our nursing home industry, whether it be our airline industry, whether it be our commercial laboratories, I can speak on behalf of President Trump and our entire task force when I say we are profoundly grateful for the spirit that’s being reflected by companies all across the United States of America, grateful for the leadership at the state level.  And the American people should be confident that that spirit of partnership is going to continue to drive this at every level as we work our way through dealing with the coronavirus in the United States.
With that, I’m going to recognize Dr. Deborah Birx for her comments.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Good evening. Over the — over the last 12 hours, we’ve been able to receive information, both from South Korea and Italy, adding to our China information.  And it’s as we thought: The elderly and preexisting conditions have a more serious illness when confronted with the coronavirus.
Reassuringly, in South Korea, no one has died under 30.  This is reassuring to us.  And the median age in Italy was 81, of those who succumbed.  Those who became ill, the median age was 60.
So we find this data reassuring but it also has
has really caused us to focus on the Americans who might be most vulnerable.  So we’re focusing resources, attention, and all of our capacity to ensure those who have preexisting conditions and those who are elderly have access to the best prevention and treatment options.
The prevention options flow right through all of us to ensure that we have good protective hygiene for our elderly clients around the globe.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  And as you heard, because of the risk for our nation’s seniors, we are doubling down on our efforts.  Today, we put out three memos.  One was to hospitals about triaging and placement for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus.  We also put out some information to nursing homes about limiting visitors to nursing homes, monitoring staff.  And then, finally, we put out some information to our state surveyors that are going to be surveying our nation’s nursing homes and hospitals around infection control.
So all of that information went out this morning.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you, Seema.
CDC.  Bob Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I think what I’d like to highlight today is that — first, echo what the Vice President started with when he was giving the American people the advice that he did as he went through that we do have listed out on our CDC website: CDC.gov.
It really is very important, it’s very pragmatic about washing your hands 20 seconds in soap and water or using the other disinfectants.  Obviously, training yourself to
cover your sneeze or cough either in your elbow or with a Kleenex that you will dispose of.  These are very important things.  Working hard not to touch your face.
I think the most important thing for many of those individuals that might be a little type A: If you get sick, stay home.  You’re not helping your colleagues by going to work sick.
And again, I think these are just very pragmatic.  We’ve listed them.  They’re absolutely no different than what we ask the American public to do for the flu.
The second thing I would like to do is continue to get the help from you to get those messages out.  The one that’s the most important that the Vice President also talked about is the role of masks.  We need these N95 masks for the healthcare workers that are taking care of these patients.  We do not recommend them to be used by the general public.
And again, you all — if you tell the stories — are able to be great communicators of that, so that the American public gets accurate information and gets good guidance from your experts that you’ll reach out to for your stories.  So that’s what I would ask you to do.
And I’ll reiterate what the Vice President said at the beginning: that although we’re continuing to see new community cases in this nation, the overall risk to the American public at this time still remains low.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Just to reiterate what was said by several of our colleagues here is that we make policy recommendations and analysis of what we’re going to recommend based on accumulation of data.  Data is very important.  What Dr. Birx just told you is data is that underscores some of the things that we’ve been telling you.
You know, when you talk about risk — you know, risk is something that’s vague to people.  And we’ve said many a time, if you talk about risk of infection throughout the country, it’s a low risk.  If you talk about someone who is infected — and we do have infected people in this country.  You’ve heard that from Dr. Redfield.  You understand the situation that we have in Seattle.
If you do get infected, if you’re infected as — taking Seattle as the microcosm of that — it is exactly what Dr. Birx said: The risk of getting into difficulties is very heavily weighted towards people with underlying conditions and people with the elderly, where the young people — and there will be an exception here or there, the same way we see with influenza — but the risk for a young person who gets infected to getting into trouble is really low, based on a lot of data that’s coming out of foreign countries, particularly out of China.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Carson?
ADMINISTRATOR CARSON:  I want to thank the Vice President and the President for very aggressive and careful leadership.  Now, I was involved throughout my neurosurgical career with a lot of very, very complex cases and dealt with a lot of renowned physicians, but I must say the people on this task force are extremely impressive.  Have been considering all the various different possibilities — outlining scenarios for all the possibilities that can occur.  And it’s very comforting — and recognize that the risk to a healthy adult still remains quite low, largely because of the aggressive actions that have been taken and are continuing to be taken every day.
And just one last point and that is: The pharmaceuticals, who normally are rivals, have worked together voluntarily.  Wouldn’t that be a great lesson for the politicians?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
Quick informational announcement: I’ll be traveling with many members of the task force to Minnesota tomorrow.  We’ll be visiting 3M, which is poised to literally begin manufacturing millions more masks for our healthcare workers.  And then we’ll be traveling on to Washington State.
We’ll be meeting with Governor Inslee and with his health team to ensure that the full resources of the federal government are being brought to bear in support of their efforts to protect the health of the people across the Seattle area.
So, with that, let me start right here.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-2/

1231,Trump,2020-03-03 12:57:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force,Nan,"
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everybody.  We just completed today’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  As you know, the President spoke this morning to county officials.  And I want to remind everyone, as the President did today, that when it comes to health issues, state and local health authorities are in the lead, and the President reflected on that today.
The President also traveled with Dr. Fauci and the Secretary to the National Institute of Health and had a briefing there.  For our part, I was on Capitol Hill.  This team briefed the Republican Senate caucus, and we were invited to and briefed the Democrat Senate caucus.
Tomorrow we’ll be on the House side.  Our schedule is still firming up in the course of the day.  But we had the opportunity to have a fulsome discussion about policies, and not just limited to the supplemental but, very broadly, dealing with the issue of the coronavirus in the country.  And we were grateful for the opportunity to appear before both of those caucuses.
Let me give you just a couple of topline numbers.  At this point, we are at 77 domestic cases of coronavirus.  Sadly, Washington State confirmed three additional deaths today.  Our condolences go to the families of those that were lost.  That puts us at nine deaths, domestic.  And they were individuals at either in a nursing home or who had been critically ill.  And their families have our condolences.
We are at 13 states, plus New York City — 14 total jurisdictions at this point — where we have coronavirus cases currently operating.
I’ve had conversations today with the governor of Illinois and — as well as the governor of Washington State, and good and productive conversations.  And we’re extremely grateful for the leadership the governors across the country and their health departments are providing in this instance.
Today, a couple of decision points from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  Today, we will issue new guidance from the CDC that will make it clear that any American can be tested with no restrictions, subject to doctor’s orders.  Several governors said to me that there was an impression that the test would not be administered to people who were only mildly symptomatic.  We are issuing new guidance, effective immediately, from the CDC that will make it clear that any clinician on health authority can administer the test.
Testing was much a focal point of our efforts today.  Dr. Birx and the Secretary and I convened a conference call with CEOs of some of the nation’s leading commercial laboratories.  At this point, as the experts around me can describe, we are addressing the testing issue in a variety of ways.  CDC-approved tests are moving out.  We should have 2,500 kits out before the end of this week, which represents about 1.5 million tests.  Those are being focused on hospitals in the areas that have been affected, as well as hospitals that have requested those tests.
In addition to that, IDT is also spinning up their manufacturing for tests.  I am told that there’ll be up to a million a week by next week.  And in our meetings with the CEOs of commercial laboratories — and I’m going to have Dr. Birx speak to this — we will be meeting tomorrow, here at the White House, with those CEOs, to clear away any potential barriers to them leaning all the way in.
It was inspiring to be with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday who had already formed a consortium to begin to share resources and share information about meeting the need both with therapeutics and with the development of a vaccine.  And we’ll be challenging, as we did today, on the President’s behalf — we’ll be challenging the commercial laboratories in the country to spin up their capacity to collaborate and be able to process testing much more rapidly.
Seema Verma will elaborate for you, but tonight, the task force has authorized the decision that we’re going to put all inspection resources, at the state level, focused on infectious disease, looking at nursing homes being a focal point of vulnerability and a vulnerable population.  And Seema will clarify that with you, in addition to a variety of new sets of guidance that CMS is going to be issuing to nursing homes to really focus — focus our energy and our efforts on protecting the most vulnerable and where we see the locus of the coronavirus today.
Finally, we today — OMB will be issuing a new guidance.  We will be directing all federal government agencies to review internal travel policies and to adhere to State Department advisories with regard to international travel.
Let me say again that, as Dr. Fauci reiterated again today, the threat of the coronavirus to the American public remains low.  And as we continue to evaluate our circumstances, we’ll continue to bring recommendations to the President for changes.  But at this point, we’re simply directing a review of internal travel policies of all federal agencies and directing them to adhere to State Department advisories.
Before I introduce the Secretary, let me also say tomorrow we’ll be meeting with the CEOs of all the major airline carriers here.  The topic will be contact tracing data and how we can — we have a strong relationship in the 11 airports that have been assisting us with screening personnel coming back into the country — we call them “funneling airports” — but we’re going to be meeting with CEOs tomorrow to talk about even greater cooperation from them.
But again, I would just — I would just conclude by saying that tomorrow will be one week since the President asked me to lead the White House effort.  And I couldn’t be more proud or more impressed with the efforts at HHS, CDC, all of our agencies — NIH.  And I couldn’t be more proud to see the way states and local governments have had a seamless relationship with federal agencies in responding to this.  And that’s the relationship that we have forged.
We’ll continue to build on that, and we’ll continue to focus this week obviously on ensuring that, in the supplemental bill, we not only make sure that the federal agencies are properly funded, but as I’ve told 50 governors and 3 territorial governors, we’re going to make sure that state agencies and local healthcare providers also have the resources to be able to meet their needs without hesitation, to lean into this effort.  As the President said, this is all hands on deck.  We’re all in this together, and we’re going to continue to bring a whole-of-government approach.
With that, let me recognize the Secretary and then Dr. Birx, and we’ll each make some comments and take a few questions.  Okay?
Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Great.  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  And thank you all.  As the Vice President mentioned, and I’m sure we’ll all reiterate, at this time, the threat to any individual American remains low from the coronavirus.
As we’ve said, that can change rapidly.  We are watching for that constantly.  And, of course, with regard to any individual in contact with someone who is positive for the coronavirus, that risk is, of course, higher.
We’re working to keep that risk low.  We are aggressively deployed.  The CDC is out in the state of Washington, out in Santa Clara County in California, assisting with community mitigation steps, taking the lessons that we have both from our pandemic action plan, as well as from the Singapore and Hong Kong cases — what they’ve been able to do and some of the steps they’ve been able to get this situation more under control there.
I’m also very pleased to announce that the President of United States has donated his quarterly check to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health at HHS to fund the coronavirus preparedness and response activities.  So, very pleased to receive that check today.
We continue to make significant advances, in particular on removing barriers and moving forward in our response activities, basically using every day that we have gained by the President’s strong actions to take advantage of those days to advance the ball.
So, today, the President was up at NIAID, Dr. Fauci’s institute, where he was informed that, just yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the entry into clinical trial — phase one clinical trials of the vaccine candidate developed by NIAID scientists, who he got to meet today, and working with Moderna.  So, hopefully, within again five to six weeks, that will be in humans and phase one clinical trials as a result of the FDA clearance.
In addition, just last night, the FDA and CDC issued guidance with regard to these respirator masks, the N95 masks that you see that look more like cones on someone’s face — healthcare workers.  Something people don’t know is most of those N95 masks — the respirators, they’re called — in the United States are used in the construction trades and industrial trade.  So, construction workers, miners.
And yesterday, the FDA and CDC issued guidance under an emergency use authorization, making it clear that those industrial N95 masks are approved and appropriate for use by healthcare providers under the current exigent circumstances of the novel coronavirus.  That will free up a massive amount of additional supply in the marketplace for our healthcare providers, even as we engage in procurement activities under the supplemental that we hope to get to produce even more of those.
And then, finally, Dr. Hahn is going to be discussing with you some really important deregulatory work that we did.  We think it’s right-sizing regulation with regard to diagnostic testing that we did on Sunday morning that is unleashing massive capacity in the United States for lab developed testing.  So with that, let me stop.
Mr. Vice President, thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  And let me — and perhaps Dr. Fauci can amplify this in just a moment: The American people do not have to buy a mask.  The focus of our administration’s efforts in this area, as I talked to Governor Pritzker today in Illinois, is we have a — we have a reserve of some 43 million masks.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Masks overall.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’re working on — I’ll be traveling to 3M in Minnesota.  The supplemental will contemplate a contract with that company and Honeywell and others to produce masks.  And what we want to do is focus and make available the medical devices and protection for our healthcare workers.
And so, whatever you can do to get the word out to the American people that it is not necessary for the American people to buy masks in the midst of the coronavirus spread in the country.  The risk remains low.  And I’ll let the physicians describe that to you if there’s questions.
Let me introduce Dr. Birx for her comments.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  So, yesterday, we talked about not only the vaccine development but the work ongoing in therapeutics, which will be available much earlier, as well as novel work on monoclonal antibodies.
For those of you who are in the audience who may be a little older, who used to get immunoglobulin before you traveled, it’s on that same principle.  It can be used both as a protective, as well as a therapeutic.  And so there’s work going on for that.
Today, we worked very hard and concentrated on the public — the private sector to really get them engaged in testing, because we know every family is concerned, particularly mixed-generation families and households where there’s both young children and the elderly that we know are at higher risk, potentially, for more sickness and actually more severe cases.
And so we know that the private sector is going to be critical in getting those assays immediately available in more the pediatric clinics, the CVSs, and so that anybody who wants a test can access tests.
Those are discussions we will have tomorrow and be able to really summarize on the movement towards making diagnostics more available, not only the nucleic acid diagnostics but the diagnostics that allow us to see who has been infected previously and really understand what the prevalence and incidence of this disease is — because it’s very difficult right now, when you’re only looking at the sickest, to really understand how broad infections may or may not be.
So we’re excited about that work that’s going to happen tomorrow.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Very good.  Thank you, Dr. Birx.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  As the Vice President said, we will be focusing all of our state agency resources that are involved in inspecting nursing homes and other healthcare facilities to focus on infection control practices.  Healthcare providers are going to play a very critical role in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and CMS has a unique role in holding healthcare providers accountable for maintaining these essential health and safety standards.
We’re also issuing a call to action to hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis providers, and all healthcare facilities to review their infection control and emergency preparedness procedures to ensure that they are in compliance with CMS regulatory requirements.
In addition, we are reissuing some guidance around infection control, around transfers between nursing homes and hospitals, encouraging and requiring them to consult with local healthcare officials.  And we’re also issuing some guidance around screening visitors and healthcare workers.
The third item that we’re releasing today is guidance to state inspectors who physically visit and evaluate healthcare facilities.  The guidance provides information on the latest CDC protocols that they must follow when inspecting these facilities with suspected cases of respiratory illness.  Inspectors should be coordinating with the CDC, CMS, and local healthcare officials.  And they should also make sure that they have the appropriate protective — personal protective equipment.
We’ve also deployed — CMS has deployed two of our infection control specialists to CDC in Atlanta so that we can remain in lockstep with the CDC as the situation evolves.  And this will allow us to coordinate our policies in real time.
And finally, CMS is preparing to send a team of inspectors to Washington State to inspect the nursing home, dialysis facility, and hospital that was involved in the recent COVID-19 cases so we can determine if all federal health and safety regulations were followed.
And we’ll be evaluating the situation daily and continue to provide updates.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  I’ll just take a quick moment to just reiterate what was said about the visit to the NIH by the President.  And we were able to map out and discuss — and something that we want to make sure everyone understands: He saw it firsthand the process of vaccine development and why it’s very, very important that you do it in a stepwise fashion — even though we’re going more quickly than we’ve ever done that — and that is to go through a phase one trial to show that it is safe, and then even a phase two trial, which will take several months.
So if you’re looking at what’s going to be available, the one dictum that you always know in medicine is: First, do no harm.  And we’ve got to make sure that if we’re going to protect the American people, if we’re going to be giving them a vaccine to otherwise healthy people to protect them, we’ve got to make sure we have a vaccine that is safe and that is proven to be effective.  Not only just safe with any side effects, but there have been situations where even vaccines have actually made someone worse.  So we got to make sure that we don’t do that.
That’s the reason why, even though we’re going at rocket speed, it’s not going to be at least a year to a year and a half before we have a product that we would be able to confidently say let’s rev it up and give.  Not the case with therapeutics, because therapeutics — you’re giving it to someone who is already ill, and you’re trying to save their life.  That doesn’t mean you’re reckless with it; it means that you have almost an immediate answer as to whether it works.
So there are a couple of big trials that are going on in China, and there is one that’s going on right here in the United States, testing a single drug.  And there’ll be other drugs to do that, testing whether or not if you do “standard of care” versus “standard of care versus a drug,” whether or not that drug will actually be effective.
I was asked the question outside when we landed from the NIH, “When will that be?”  It will be when you get enough data, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board — which is a group that independently looks at the data to determine are you actually making things worse or are you making things better.  And they look at the data intimately.
Someone asked me, “Will that be two months, three months, five months?”  We don’t know.  It will be when the time comes when they look at the data, if — and this is a big “if” — don’t misinterpret it — if a drug is effective, then you would make it available to individuals.  Not guessing if it’s effective, but is it effective.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Hahn?
DR. HAHN:  Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to clarify some of the issues that have been in the press and concerns by the American people around the diagnostic testing.
So, first of all, this is a test that is not what we call a point-of-care test.  It’s not like the strep test, where you go in a doctor’s office and you get that test done.  This is a test where a swab is done and it’s sent to a laboratory, and in the laboratory they can perform that.
Currently, this test is available in state public health labs, based upon the great work that CDC has done to develop this test.  And the type of test is called a PCR test.  So CDC developed this test and has been distributing this to state public health laboratories.  And by current count, there are 46 state public health laboratories that have access to this test and can do this testing around the country.
So, additional tests are being performed by a company — or being developed — not developed, but being manufactured by a company called Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT.  They’re working with CDC to increase the capacity of the CDC-developed test.  They’re giving those tests to CDC to further disseminate to the public health laboratories.  They are also receiving orders from around the country — academic healthcare institutions, big hospitals, as well as commercial laboratories around the country — to further disseminate that test.
Their estimate is that, by the end of this week, they will be able to have shipped 1 million tests to these non-public health laboratories.  In subsequent weeks, they expect to escalate even further their manufacturing to higher numbers than that.  We don’t have estimates for that for you at this time.
But we expect that the shipment of those tests, the non-public health labs, will significantly increase the capacity around the country for testing.
On Saturday, you know we issued an emergency use authorization, which provided a deregulatory and — regulatory flexibility approach to what’s called LDTs, or laboratory developed tests.  That means X hospital in whatever state, whatever county, if they’re certified, can develop their own laboratory based test.  They notify us when that occurs, and then 15 days later provide us the validation data.
We use the same validation criteria.  These are experienced laboratories, and we’ve already heard from four laboratories around the country that they’ve developed these tests and have started using those tests.  So you can see this is a layered approach to increase our capacity.
And finally, FDA has been working with large commercial laboratories over the last three to four weeks, using our EUA approach, to help develop additional testing capacity.
And as the Vice President mentioned, we met with members today, over the phone, of large laboratories to actually discuss their expanded capacity and to further increase the availability of these tests for Americans.
So one last point: What can the average American expect in terms of availability of this test?  Well, first of all, as we mentioned, CDC will be issuing new guidance with respect to the fact that a physician should be able to order this test, based upon their own clinical assessment of that patient.
And, secondly, we expect that their access — Americans’ access to this test will increase as more and more laboratories around the country have availability of this test.  That should increase next week and further in the weeks ahead as more and more tests are available.  Thank you.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I think what I would — I want to make a few points.  The first point I want to make is to recognize the, really, 24/7 work that the state and local, territorial, tribal health departments are doing.
They have — they’re at the front lines responding to this, implementing the principles that we’ve talked about before that are so important for this public health approach: early case identification, isolation of those individuals that are confirmed, and then aggressive contact tracing to try to identify additional cases.  And then it repeats to isolation contact tracing.
We’re going to continue to see new cases diagnosed in the community across this country.  But that really is a success, in my view, not a failure, of the incredible public health community that we have in these states and these local health departments, tribal and territorial.
I also would like to make a comment to the American people.  I want them to be prepared for the reality that there are going to be more cases in the community.  But I want them to continue their daily lives.  I want them to be mindful of the opportunity, again, to prepare themselves and their families as we see this.  As I mentioned I want these new cases to be viewed as a success, in one sense, of our effective public health community, and not a failure.
Finally, I just want to reemphasize what was said — one thing else that they can do.  These protective masks, they really are for healthcare professionals that are taking care of these individuals that are sick in the hospital.  We need all the American public to be part of — as the Vice President says, we’re all on the same team here.  And one of the most important components of that team is the American public.
And I want them to recognize: If we felt there was a public health reason for them to be going out to develop masks, those of us here — Tony and myself — would tell you.  But these masks are meant for the healthcare professionals that are at the frontlines trying to care these men and women that are quite sick.
And lastly, I just want to reemphasize once more what was set already by the Secretary and the Vice President.  Again, despite these new community cases, the risk at this time to the American public remains low.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  We’ll take a few questions.  Thanks.  Jim?  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force/

1352,Trump,2020-01-31 10:42:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Members of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force,Nan,"
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I’m Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Chairman of the President’s Task Force on the Novel Coronavirus.
I’m going to start by turning things over to Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to discuss the current situation on the novel coronavirus.  Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Let me give you an update on the current situation of the novel coronavirus.  First though, I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public currently is low.  Our goal is do all we can do to keep it that way.
Second, I want to recognize the concern that the American public may have.  And I want to reiterate what I just said: Currently, the risk of the American public is low.
As of today, there are nearly 9,700 cases in China, with more than 200 deaths.  Additionally, currently there are another 23 countries that have confirmed, totally, 132 cases.  This also includes 12 individuals who have been confirmed in six countries who did not travel to China.
CDC has launched an aggressive public health response focused on early case recognition, isolation of those cases identified, and contact tracing around those individuals.  This response is a layered response, which includes both targeted airport screening, as well as heightened education and awareness of the American healthcare community to be vigilant in ascertaining the possibility of recent travel to China when they are evaluating patients with upper respiratory tract infection.
To date, we have confirmed six cases of this novel virus in the United States.  The most recent case had no travel history to China, but was a close personal contact of one of the previous cases that we had identified through our aggressive contact tracing.  In addition, there are currently 191 individuals that are under investigation.
Once again, I want to emphasize that this is a significant global situation, and it continues to evolve.  But I also want to emphasize again that the risk at this time to the American public is low.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Dr. Redfield.  I would now like to invite Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, to discuss the underlying rationale for the actions that I will be discussing after he concludes.  Dr. Fauci.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  The concept that’s underlying the action that you’ll hear about shortly is the issue of the unknown aspects of this particular outbreak.  So let me enumerate just a few of these.
I can start off by putting it into perspective by telling you I often get asked — we have an influenza outbreak here.  We have about 8,000 deaths already.  We have about 100,000 hospitalizations.  Why are we paying such attention?  And why are we doing the kinds of things we’re doing here right now?
Well, the reason is, despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there’s a certainty, for example, of seasonal flu.  I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down.  You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalizations, as we’ve done over the years.
The issue now with this is that there’s a lot of unknowns. As you can see just from the media, the number of cases have steeply inclined each and every day.  You know that, in the beginning, we were not sure if there were asymptomatic infection, which would make it a much broader outbreak than what we’re seeing.  Now we know for sure that there are.
It was not clear whether an asymptomatic person could transmit it to someone while they were asymptomatic.  Now we know from a recent report from Germany that that is absolutely the case.
There are a number of countries outside of China that have travel-related cases.  And now what we’re seeing is that there are secondary cases from them, and, as Bob mentioned, we also have that in this country.  The WHO has issued, as you know, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declaration.
If you put all these things together, I underscore what Bob said: We still have a low risk to the American public, but we want to keep it at a low risk.  And because there are so many unknowns here, we’re going to take the action that the Secretary will describe, in a temporary way, to make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.  Thank you.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.  Today, President Trump took decisive action to minimize the risk of the spread of novel coronavirus in the United States.  Since taking office, President Trump has been clear: His top priority is the safety of the American people.  In addition to the steps that the doctors have outlined, we continue to operationalize a multi-layered, cross-agency, public health response.
Following the World Health Organization’s decision to declare the 2019 novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States.  The actions we have taken and continue to take complement — complement the work of China and the World Health Organization to contain the outbreak within China.
In accordance with the declaration, beginning at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time; Sunday, February the 2nd, the United States government will implement temporary measures to increase our abilities to detect and contain the coronavirus proactively and aggressively.  Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in Hubei Province in the previous 14 days will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine to ensure they are they are provided proper medical care and health screening.
To be clear, this applies only to U.S. citizens who have been in Hubei Province in the past 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the United States.
Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in the rest of Mainland China within the previous 14 days will undergo proactive entry health screening at a select number of ports of entry and up to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they’ve not contracted the virus and do not pose a public health risk.
Additionally, the President has signed a presidential proclamation, using his authority pursuant to Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, temporarily suspending the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the 2019 novel coronavirus.
As a result, foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time.
Once again, these actions will become effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time; Sunday, February 2nd.  These prudent, targeted, and temporary actions will decrease the pressure on public health officials screening incoming travelers, expedite the processing of U.S. citizens and permanent residents returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people.
I want to stress: The risk of infection for Americans remains low.  And with these and our previous actions, we are working to keep the risk low.  All agencies are working aggressively to monitor this continually evolving situation and to keep the public informed in a constantly transparent way.
The United States appreciates China’s efforts and coordination with public health officials across the globe, and continues to encourage the highest levels of transparency.
It is likely that we will continue to see more cases in the United States in the coming days and weeks, including some limited person-to-person transmission.  The American public can be assured the full weight of the U.S. government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people.
I’d now like to invite Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun for an update.
DEPUTY SECRETARY BEIGUN:  Good afternoon.  And thank you, Secretary Azar.  My name is Steve Biegun, and I am the Deputy Secretary of State, and I represent the State Department on the President’s Novel Coronavirus Task Force.
Let me describe briefly the role of the Department of State in the proceedings of this task force and our contributions.  Our first responsibility is to monitor events on the ground in China where we have the presence of U.S. diplomats, and to give clear and accurate advice to American citizens and, in particular, American travelers considering visiting or staying in China.
In this particular case, this includes identifying any health or safety risks to which they may be subjected, but also, very importantly, identifying their access to essential services such as healthcare in parts of China that are affected by this coronavirus.
China has an excellent healthcare system, but, in parts of the country, it is simply overwhelmed and the accessibility to that healthcare for any reason — including potential infection, but also any other type of accident in need of medical care — may be compromised during the Chinese government’s own treatment of the consequences of this virus.
Finally, we also make our judgments based upon any obstacles, particularly obstacles to movement that American citizens might face in the country.  And in China, we have seen barriers to travel, both within and without China, as well as between the United States and China.  And so we’ve given prudent advice, over the course of the week, to American citizens in order for them — to allow them to make the best possible choices for themselves.
Our second responsibility is to assist U.S. citizens in the affected areas as much as possible.  Because we have a presence on the ground, we can provide advice and, in some cases, we can make other arrangements.  But I want to emphasize this is “as possible,” and we will continue to review what we can do in certain circumstances.
Finally, and very importantly, the core mission of the Department of State is to work closely with our international partners.  And in this case, we are working very closely with the Chinese government in order to address a number of related matters.
But let me start, on behalf of the President and the Secretary of State, by extending our deepest compassion to the people of China.  This has been a very difficult time for the Chinese people.  It came at a point of their peak holiday season.  Many are affected.  Many have lost loved ones or are enduring the illness of loved ones.  And I want the Chinese people to know that they have the deepest sympathies of the United States of America.
Let me also say and echo what Secretary Azar said, which is we are deeply appreciative of the close cooperation we have with the Chinese government as we work together to try to find appropriate ways to address any risks and challenges from this virus.
And finally, the United States will continue to cooperate with China in ways that we could potentially provide assistance, including technical assistance, and also, to the extent possible, any critical supplies that the Chinese need in order to address this virus.  And we are working very hard to find donors and make arrangements so that we can — we can undertake a robust effort to help the Chinese people get their arms around this outbreak.
Thank you.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Secretary Biegun.  Let me — let me next invite the Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli to take the podium for some comments.
ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  I am Ken Cuccinelli.  I’m the Acting Deputy Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, and I’m the Department’s representative on the task force led by Secretary Azar.
Several elements of the Department of Homeland Security are engaged in implementing the medical strategy you heard described here, including Customs and Border Protection, which stands at our land ports, seaports, and airports — and I’ll come back to the airports in a moment — particularly the Office of Field Operations personnel who you see when you come back into the country from your travels.  They’re the first line of defense when you land and come to the country.
Additionally engaged is TSA — the security and the engagement with the airlines.  Our chief medical officer in the department is in CWMD and they’re — we were providing medical support at the airports.
So we’re using contract authority that we have to backfill the CDC personnel, so they can be freed up for other missions at the airports where medical screening is being focused.
FEMA continues to prepare and support HHS preparations themselves.  And then the United States Coast Guard, of course, commands the ports of the United States and deals with incoming shipping, which is obviously slower than the airplanes but coming nonetheless, and we are prepared to deal with each of those.
The President’s proclamation will have Customs and Border Protection ensuring that United States citizens, legal permanent residents, and their immediate families continue to enter the United States, though they — those coming from Hubei Province, as you heard from the Secretary, will be subject to quarantine and the others from China to screening.
We will be implementing a funneling effort at the airports.  This is done under the authority of the Customs and Border Protection, and it will include seven airports.  So starting five o’clock on Sunday, Eastern Time, incoming flights from China will be funneled through seven airports.  Those airports are JFK, Chicago’s O’Hare, in San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Honolulu, and LAX.
This is done under CBP’s authority.  It will be executed by the Secretary the Department of Homeland Security, consistent with the President’s proclamation and in support of that effort — again, so we can focus the expertise of the medical professionals that will do the screening to implement this.

1358,Trump,2020-01-30 05:15:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway, ONDCP Director Jim Carroll, and Assistant Secretary of Public Health ADM Brett Giroir",Nan,"
MS. CONWAY:  Good morning.  Thank you for being here.  We come before you bearing good news.  For the first time in four years, life expectancy in the United States of America has increased.  And for the first time in 29 years, the number of drug overdose deaths has decreased.
This has not happened through coincidence.  It’s happened through causation.  It’s owing in large part to a whole-of-government approach to treat the whole person, led by President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and really, the entire administration.
Nearly 70,000 of our fellow Americans died from an overdose last year, and 48,000 of those involved opioids.  About 70 percent of those deaths also involved some type of synthetic opioid, most prominently fentanyl, which could be an instant killer.  A couple of tiny grains are a lethal dose.
We’ve met with first responders, parents who have lost children, people in recovery, people who are running recovery centers.  We’ve met with mothers whose babies were born chemically dependent.  And we certainly have met with health professionals.  All of them have shared stories of loss but, increasingly, of courage and recovery.
This is a crisis that we call the “crisis next door,” because we want people to know, from the beginning, that the silence and stigma that it tends to — many people, it prevents them from seeking out the kind of treatment and help that is available to them is a very big priority for us — busting through that stigma and silence.
We also want to make clear, in this crisis next door, that it is indiscriminate.  It affects all races, socioeconomic status, gender, age, and certainly other affiliations.  If the crisis is indiscriminate, then the response must be indiscriminate.
And that’s why, in addition to everything that the President and the First Lady and the administration have done, I wanted to share with you, as a reflection, what I consider to be the most robust and significant bipartisan accomplishment of the President’s first term: H.R.6, the SUPPORT Act.  The President signed it into law following overwhelmingly unanimous support from every Democrat who voted for it in the House and the Senate.  This overwhelmingly bipartisan action has led to an increase in the money and awareness on the opioid and poly-drug crisis.
Features of the SUPPORT Act include the CRIB Act, where there is more money and more action for those neonatal abstinence syndrome babies that I mentioned before.  Medical professionals tell us it’s best to keep the mother — it’s best for the mother and it’s best for the baby to keep them together.  And, increasingly, that is happening.
Also, the nearly $3.7 billion in new grants put forth by the administration have made a real difference in our municipalities.  The STOP Act has helped us increase the number of seizures of fentanyl and other synthetic opiates coming through our mail.  It’s up to about 38 percent, and we have a goal, if not a mandate, of 100 percent.
Let me go through a couple of the numbers: 4.1 percent overdose death decline overall in our nation.  And that is the first time in 29 years — nearly three decades.  But in some of the hardest-hit states, we’re off a peak of over 20 percent: 19 percent in Pennsylvania, 22 percent decline over the peak high in Ohio, 11 percent in West Virginia, 14 percent in Minnesota, 7 percent in North Carolina — just to highlight a few of them.  Also, the Customs and Border Protection in the last fiscal year increased the seizures of fentanyl by 21 percent.
We also launched a targeted ad campaign geared at youth that was seen by over 1.4 billion views and over 58 percent.  In fact, the longer documentary type won an Emmy.
Naloxone prescriptions have increased over 400 percent.  Our Surgeon General, in April of 2018, issued the first advisory by a surgeon general in over a decade.  And Dr. Adams said at the time: We need to have naloxone more available to our first responders, to our health professionals, to our school systems, libraries, YMCAs and the rest, but also to each and every one of us.  The Surgeon General says, if each of us were to carry naloxone on our person, we too can be part of the solution, reversing these overdose deaths by administering this overdose-reversing medication.
Last night, Congress passed a 15-month extension of the current emergency scheduling of fentanyl analogues.  This is a critical tool for law enforcement because it allows them to continue to detect, analyze, and handle safely and effectively this very lethal drug.
In our effort to focus on prevention education, treatment and recovery, law enforcement interdiction, I’m also happy to report that we have record back-to-back-to-back-to-back collections on Take Back Day.  And I do want to credit our partners, like Google, who have been incredibly helpful to us in raising awareness and action among the public in understanding how to safely and broadly dispose of your unused, unneeded expired drugs.
In addition to Take Back Day, the prescriptions of high-dose opioids have fallen by over 32 percent since the President came into office.  If you need the pain medication, it will be there.  People are walking around with what’s left from a bottle of 30, 40 pills, and that’s where some of the peril begins.
In addition, we launched FindTreatment.gov — a completely overhauled tool for every American to access so that they can customize finding treatment for their needs.  You can customize it by age, by geography, whether you’re veteran, by LGBT, certainly by gender.  And this promotes quality over quantity.  When you type it in and you customize it, you can find treatment centers that are best for you.  Maybe you need to be there for a short amount of time.  Maybe you need to be there in-patient, out-patient.  Maybe you need to be there a longer amount of time.  You can customize that quite confidentially.
From 1999 to 2015, the government reported a 20 percent reduction in our workforce due to opioid and other drug abuse and addiction.  A 20 percent decline over 16 years.  I’m happy to report that because we’ve invested over $100 million in displaced worker grants across 17 states in the Cherokee Nation, those numbers are moving.
We are trying to treat the whole person, not just check in person.  We got you in drug court; we got you in drug treatment.  Isn’t that terrific.  It’s really terrific if we can them help them acquire employment, education, skills, training, and certainly housing, on the way to full recovery.
There is so much more work to be done.  We’re very pleased that the overdose deaths have declined, but 68,000 of our fellow Americans died last year from drug overdose.  That’s 68,000 too many.  If you look at the Super Bowl this coming Sunday, that number could be represented by every single seat with 3,000 left over at the Super Bowl this coming Sunday — just to give you the actual enormity of the problem.
We will continue to fight this every single day, and we will continue to make the investments of money, of time, of education.
And with that, I’d love to turn this over to Director Jim Carroll of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and then Admiral Giroir, the Assistant Secretary for Health of the United States of America.  Thank you very much.
Jim?
DIRECTOR CARROLL:  Thank you, Kellyanne.  A couple of years ago, when President Trump and I first talked about me taking the job as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and serving as his drug czar, he instructed me to be relentless in our efforts to save lives.  And that’s exactly what we’ve done to tackle this drug problem here in the United States.
The good news that we’re announcing today is a testament to the President and his leadership on this issue.  It’s an example of what can happen when we come together and apply that whole-of-government approach.
The obstacles we face could not be greater, but through our efforts on prevention, treatment and recovery, and reducing availability, we’ve made real progress for the American people — which we not only want to sustain, we want to accelerate.
Kellyanne discussed how we got here and what these numbers mean.  Admiral Giroir will discuss the incredible headway we’re making with getting people into treatment.
But I want to highlight the progress that we have made with our international partners and our law enforcement who are critical in reducing the supply of these dangerous drugs.
Back at the G20 Summit in 2018, President Trump raised the issue of fentanyl production with the head of China and demanded a solution.  He made it clear that the United States would not tolerate the flow of fentanyl and other deadly synthetic drugs coming into our country.
Because of this, in May 2019, China scheduled fentanyl and other similar analogues, such as controlled substances, which was a historic and significant event.
Last night, the House of the Representatives passed a 15-month extension on the ban in scheduling of fentanyl, but a long-term solution is still needed.
In September of 2019, I led a White House delegation to Beijing to ensure that China was keeping up with their commitment to President Trump.  The Chinese government agreed to improve the legal framework, agreed to improve their standards for prosecution for fentanyl-related trafficking, and established law enforcement methods there that were not heard of before.
In every meeting I had with the Chinese, my counterpart said they heard the President loud and clear: that the flow of fentanyl into the United States was not tolerated.  Since then, the Chinese officials have invited our U.S. counterparts back there to watch the first-ever prosecutions of Chinese nationals for trafficking drugs into the United States.
This progress, combined with President Trump’s commitment to secure our southwest border — which is critical to stopping the flow of drugs into our country — brings together several lines of effort that will serve to keep Americans safe from the dangers of illicit drugs.
A wall acts as a force multiplier for our Border Patrol agents, and is one of the many tools that we are using to counter drug traffickers.
Taking the steps towards the humanitarian crisis at our southern border has also been critical to keeping those drugs out of the country.  The more men and women we have in uniform, the more that we have on line, the more that are stopping these traffickers — the greater chance we have of saving lives.
The Department of Justice has played a critical role in this, as they have been cracking down in unprecedented numbers on drug traffickers.
Under President Trump, the DOJ has ramped up trafficking prosecutions — not only here domestically, but internationally.
Under this administration, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more kingpin designations against operators of distributors in foreign countries.
The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas that we fund out of the White House here — which provides assistance to federal, state, and local drug task forces — has received unprecedented funding from this administration, and that is beginning to show and is part of the paradigm shift that we’re seeing.
These HIDTA initiatives, for example, have dismantled 3,000 drug trafficking organizations, they’ve removed $16.5 billion of illicit drugs off our streets, and they have made nearly 99,000 arrests of drug traffickers.
In 2018, we even added, for the first time in 17 years, the first new HIDTA to make sure that we’re tackling this.
The men and women of law enforcement, whether they’re in uniform or not, are playing this vital role and putting their lives on the line every day.
What this shows is the President’s efforts are working and we are saving lives.
Before I turn this over to Admiral Giroir, I want to ask that when you’re reporting on this issue, that when you’re reporting on these numbers, that numbers are really just part of the story.  Behind each of these numbers is a person, is a child, is a mom, a dad, someone whose loss has left a great mourning in a family.
I was with three parents yesterday who had lost their child to an overdose.  Today, we remember Jason, Amber, and Eddie, and all of the other people that we have lost.  And we continue this fight in their honor to make sure that we fulfill the President’s commitment to save American lives.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to my friend, Admiral Giroir.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY GIROIR:  Thank you very much, Director Carroll.  Again, I’m Brett Giroir.  I’m the Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services.  I’m also Secretary Azar’s principal advisor on opioid policy, and I’ve been that for about two years.  And I’m honored to wear the uniform of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.
What we see today is no accident.  This is the result of an intentional whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to overuse — to over- — to opioid use disorders and other substance use disorders.
First of all, we recognize this as the public health emergency as it is.  And as such, we have focused on many different areas to yield these results.
First, as Kellyanne said, the number of opioids that have been produced — the total amount of opioids that have been prescribed since January 2017 is reduced by 30 percent nationally.  And we have been able to do that while preserving and expanding options for pain control for those who truly are in chronic pain or have debilitating injuries.
Secondly, we’ve approached this as a public health emergency, because addiction — opioid use disorder — is a chronic brain disease.  We have unprecedented numbers of individuals who are now receiving treatment.  Our estimates are over 1.3 million individuals are now on medication-assisted treatment, and they’re also getting the psycho-behavioral support and wrap-around services that they need.
You heard about naloxone — very, very important because everybody deserves a second chance at life.  You have the power.  I hope all of you in the media carry naloxone with you.  It’s very easy.  You can save a life, give a person a second chance.
This has resulted in, as you heard, a 4.1 percent decrease in the number of deaths and a 4.6 percent decrease in the actual overdose age-adjusted mortality rate.  Very important.
A couple comments on the overall longevity.  I have been shocked.  Everyone in the public health community has been shocked that over the three years, previously, our longevity has decreased.  That really means that our children and grandchildren will live less long and less quality of lives than we have.  This is shocking, and we have not seen this since the height of the AIDS epidemic in the ’90s.
This has been reversed.  We’re now on the trajectory of increasing years of longevity, and that’s associated with a number of things.  What does that mean?  It’s only one-tenth of a year, but that’s 25 million person years we just gained by this increase in longevity.  And the good news is the preliminary data from quarter one into quarter two of 2019 is our mortality rates continue to drop.
Now, I want to talk about all the Health and Human Services issues like treatment, like prevention, but I do want to mention the social determinants of health that are very important.
There was a nationwide study in December, published in JAMA, that highlighted what we all know: When an auto plant closes, opioid mortality rate among the young goes up 85 percent.  We have to keep our eye on those socioeconomic issues and everything that we’re doing to increase employment, increase opportunity.  These all directly affect the rates that we see and that we celebrate today.
And the final thing is, we are not taking our foot off the gas.  We understand that this is a dynamic issue — opioid use disorder, other use disorders — and it’s being fueled by transnational cartels.  So we are going to keep working together.  We work weekly, daily, together across the government to make sure we continue a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach.

1420,Trump,2020-01-10 05:27:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin on Iran Sanctions,Nan,"
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Good morning, everybody.  Thank you for being here today.  I’d just like to make a brief comment before we talk about Iran sanctions.  I’m sure everybody saw that the DOW hit 29,000.  The President’s economic plans are clearly working.  We’re looking forward to the China signing, USMCA, and a very strong economy this year.
As previously announced by the President, we are announcing additional sanctions against the Iranian regime as a result of the attack on U.S. and allied troops.
First, the President is issuing an executive order authorizing the imposition of additional sanctions against any individual owning, operating, trading with, or assisting sectors of the Iranian economy, including construction, manufacturing, textiles, and mining.  And let me be clear: These will be both primary and secondary sanctions.  The EO also allows us to designate other sectors in the future as Secretary Pompeo and me think is appropriate.
Second, we are announcing 17 specific sanctions against Iran’s largest steel and iron manufacturers, three Seychelles-based entities, and a vessel involved in the transfer of products.  As a result of these actions, we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime, and we will continue our enforcement of other entities.
Third, we are taking action against eight senior Iranian officials who advanced the regime’s destabilizing activity and were involved in Tuesday’s ballistic missile strike.  Secretary Pompeo will comment more on this.
Today’s sanctions are part of our commitment to stop the Iranian regime’s global terrorist activities.  The President has been very clear: We will continue to apply economic sanctions until Iran stops its terrorist activities and commit that it will never have nuclear weapons.
I’ll now turn it over to Secretary Pompeo.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Steven.  Good morning, everyone.
Today, President Trump is delivering on the pledge that he made the day after Iran attacked American forces in Iraq: There will be a series of new sanctions.
Secretary Mnuchin just mentioned eight senior Iranian officials that are responsible for the regime’s violence, both at home and abroad.  We’re striking at the heart of the Islamic Republic’s inner security apparatus.  These sanctions targets include the Secretary of the Supreme National Council and the Commander of the Basij Forces; that’s the regime’s brute squad, which has, in the last few months, killed approximately 1,500 Iranians who were simply demanding freedom.
Our action targets other senior leaders close to the Ayatollah.  They’ve carried out his terrorist plots in destabilizing campaigns across the Middle East and around the world.  They’ve employed soldiers across the region’s battlefields.  They’ve trained militias in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere in the arts of domestic repression.
Today, they’re accountable for murder and mayhem.  The goal of our campaign is to deny the regime the resources to conduct its destructive foreign policy.  We want Iran to simply behave like a normal nation.  We believe the sanctions that we impose today further that strategic objective.
Our campaign is composed of diplomatic, economic components that have deprived the regime of billions in revenue the regime has used to fuel death and destruction across the Middle East and all across the world.
Sadly, the previous administration had opened up revenue streams for Iran.  But under our administration, oil revenues are down by 80 percent and Iran cannot access roughly 90 percent of its foreign currency reserves.  And not even two weeks ago, President Rouhani of Iran admitted that our sanctions have cost Iran over $200 billion in lost foreign income and investment.  As long as Iran’s outlaw ways continue, we will continue to impose sanctions.
Finally, I want to reiterate President Trump’s concern for Americans and dual national citizens detained inside of Iran.  Iran knows these individuals have committed no crime.  They know the charges against them are fake.  And we will do all that we can to get each of them returned home safely to their families.
With that, we’ll take just a few questions.
Yes, ma’am.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-state-mike-pompeo-secretary-treasury-steven-mnuchin-iran-sanctions/

Palm Beach, Florida
6:49 P.M. EST
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Good evening.  Myself, with Secretary Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Milley, came here to Florida today to brief the President on the activities that have taken place in the Middle East over the course of the last 72 hours.
I will leave to Secretary Esper to talk about the military activity, but I want to put it in the context of our policy with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The attacks that took place against an Iraqi facility threatened American forces.  This has been going on now for weeks and weeks and weeks.  This wasn’t the first set of attacks against this particular Iraqi facility and others where there were American lives at risk.
And today, what we did was take a decisive response that makes clear what President Trump has said for months and months and months, which is that we will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy.
We will — we will always honor that commitment to take decisive action when that takes place, and we continue to demand that the Islamic Republic of Iran act in a way that is consistent with what I laid out, back in May of 2018, for what it is that we expect Iran to do so that it can rejoin the community of nations.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to the Secretary of Defense.
SECRETARY ESPER:  Thank you.  As we reported earlier today, the Department of Defense took offensive actions in defense of our personnel and interests in Iraq by launching F-15 Strike Eagles against five targets associated with Kata’ib Hezbollah, which is an Iranian-sponsored Shiite militia group.  The targets we attacked included three targets in Western Iraq and two targets in Eastern Syria that were either command and control facilities or weapons caches for Kata’ib Hezbollah.
The strikes were successful.  The pilots and aircraft returned back to base safely.  I would add that, in our discussion today with the President, we discussed with him other options that are available.  And I would note also that we will take additional actions as necessary to ensure that we act in our own self-defense and we deter further bad behavior from militia groups or from Iran.  Thank you.

1591,Trump,2019-11-14 05:32:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan,Nan,"
ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Good morning.  Today I’d like to talk about the latest southwest border enforcement statistics, focusing primarily on the month of October.
But, first, if you recall, earlier this year we sounded an alarm — actually, quite a bit — with respect to the border crisis and asking Congress repeatedly to act to fix the loopholes in our broken immigration system, and close the gaps driving this crisis.  Unfortunately, not a single piece of meaningful legislation has been brought forward.
And as a result, this country stood by and watched as the crisis worsened, as we reached our peak in May of over 140,000 apprehensions in a single month.  However, in the continued absence of congressional action, the President, along with his administration, as well as our hardworking men and women of the Customs and Border Protection and our partner agencies, has taken action.
Through continued engagement with the government of Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, we have initiated a network of initiatives, policies, and of regulations to stem the flow of the migration.  Together, we are approaching this as the regional crisis that it is, and we have seen incredible success.
Just a few weeks ago, I described how we experienced a significant decline in apprehensions in the last four months of the fiscal year 2019, with September at that point marking the lowest number of enforcement actions during the entire year.  And that was a little over 52,000.
But I’m happy to report this month, the month of October, has continued with that trend, reaching a 14 percent decline compared to September, with just over 42,000 apprehensions, defying typical seasonal trends once again over the past seven years.  And this represents an overall decrease of almost 70 percent since the peak in May of this year.  This is a significant decline.
Let me put this in perspective real quick.  By mid-year, CBP was detaining almost 20,000 detainees in custody.  Now we average less than 3,500 daily.  At the height of the crisis, CBP apprehensions exceeded 5,000 in a single day.  Now we’re averaging just over 1,300.  And we all but ended catch and release.  Migrants can no longer expect to be allowed into the interior of the United States based on fraudulent asylum claims.  And more importantly, we’re sending a message to their criminal organizations to stop exploiting these migrants and their profit-making schemes.
And, additionally, as we’ve had to navigate unprecedented judicial activism from lower courts and the congressional inaction I talked about, the numbers show this administration has and continues to take bold action to address this crisis.  And the numbers show it’s working.
To illustrated this further, we saw a shift in the demographics in this October.  For the first time in nearly 18 months, Mexico was a country of origin for the majority of apprehensions and inadmissible aliens rather than from the Northern Triangle countries, with single adults surpassing families.  The headlines — got it: The numbers are low; the numbers are down.
But while we made great progress, I want to remind the American people that there still remains a humanitarian crisis at our southern border, and, importantly, a national security crisis along our southwest border as well.  Cartels — they continue to add to their multibillion-dollar organization on the backs of these migrants.
As I said yesterday at the Senate hearing, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has said multiple times — and I’m sure most of you heard this — that a thousand apprehensions a day is a bad day.  He’s right.  We’re still seeing daily apprehensions far exceeding that benchmark that Jeh Johnson set when he was Secretary.
And as I sit here today as a law enforcement professional, I’m absolutely perplexed why Congress cannot come together on a bipartisan manner to fix this.  We know the cartels and human smuggling organizations are exploiting the migrants making the journey here, often abused, deprived of adequate food, water, and medical attention during their journey.
We know this because, in FY19, we averaged 71 hospital visits per day throughout the year.  These smuggling organizations leave the migrants in rivers to die, they leave them in open harsh terrain to die, and they leave them in tractor-trailers to die.  The Border Patrol conducted over 4,900 rescues of migrants who the smugglers had abandoned to die.
We also encountered 24 bodies along the southern border, including skeletal remains.  We know children are being rented and recycled, and presented as fake families.
So, as you can clearly see, our job is not over — not until we shut down the cartels and the human smuggling organizations and put them out of business.  And the President is committed to doing just that.
That’s why our success at addressing the humanitarian crisis should not be overshadowed by the real national security crisis we face.  Both crises are interconnected and they have to be attacked that way.  Transnational criminal organizations, they don’t just exploit the migrants themselves, they also flood our country with dangerous drugs.
Last year, CBP officers and Border Patrol agents seized more than 750,000 pounds of illicit narcotics.  And our Air and Marine Operations contributed to the seizure of additional 285,000 pounds of cocaine.  Seizures of the four hard narcotics — heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl — all went up last year.  Last year — and I know we’ve talked about this before — but over 68,000 deaths in this country due to illicit narcotic use.  And methamphetamine has seen a resurgence in this country.  Superlabs in Mexico are taking over the production and flooding the United States with cheaper and purer forms of meth.
Nationwide, in October of this year, CBP intercepted more than 54,000 pounds of drugs.  That’s 45 percent higher than this time last year.  And here’s a couple of stats that, really, should shock every American in this country: We seized over 9,700 pounds of methamphetamine.  That’s up over 90 percent the same time last year.  We seized 284 pounds of fentanyl in this month alone — an 84 percent increase from this time last year.
And last month, on the southwest border, CBP seized more than 47,000 pounds of drugs — a 50 percent increase from this time last year.  And we intercepted double the amount of methamphetamine last month than we did last year on the southwest border.
The cartels and smuggling organizations continue to exploit our immigration system and enforcement vulnerabilities as we’re pulled off the line, time and time again, to deal with the humanitarian crisis, increasing the threat to our national security.  Last year, more than 150,000 migrants who illegally entered this country got away.
The illicit narcotics the transnational criminal organizations are flooding the U.S. with are making their way to every town, city, and state in this country.  It isn’t just a border issue.  Make no mistake: If your city, town, or state has a meth problem, it came from the southwest border.
So when we talk about the importance of the resources we need — including the wall, and the 76 miles of new wall system that’s been built, or the more than 450 new miles of wall we anticipate having constructed by the end of 2020 — it’s about increasing the CBP’s operational capacity to address both the humanitarian and national security crisis we face at the southwest border, improving our ability to safeguard the United States, uphold the rule of law, and maintain the integrity of the system, and put the cartels out of business.  That’s our goal, that’s this President’s goal, and we’re getting there.
With that, I’ll take some questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-acting-cbp-commissioner-mark-morgan-2/

1617,Trump,2019-11-08 04:04:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie,Nan,"
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you all for coming.  This is our week of weeks at the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This is the week that we honor the 41 million Americans who have put on the uniform since the first shots were fired at Lexington Green in April of 1775.
Last night, the President held a ceremony with the National commanders of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and Rolling Thunder to permanently honor those POWs and MIAs who have been lost to the history books since our first war in the 1700s.  He ordered the flying of the POW and MIA flag at all federal departments and agencies.  And that was an important first step on this Veterans Day, 101 years after the end of the Great War.  And the President will be following that up with his attendance at the New York City Veterans Day Parade, the first President to attend America’s largest parade, on Monday.
I am here to talk a little bit about the state of our VA.
It is — it is my honor to have been the Secretary, now for a year and three months.  As General Mattis used to say, “I was born in khaki diapers.”  So this is the world that I grew up in.  And I want to say that this President was the first in the post-World War Two history to make veterans not only the centerpiece of his campaign, but also the centerpiece of his administration.
And he has made true to his commitments by authorizing us to present to the Congress the largest budget in the history of this department: $220 billion calling for 400,000 employees.
We have, in the last year, achieved the highest patient satisfaction rates in VA’s history, sitting somewhere at about 89.7 percent.
The annals of the American Medical Association and the annals of Internal Medicine have said, just in the last year, that VA’s healthcare is as good or better than any in the private sector.  And our wait times are more than comparable with the private sector.
Under President Trump, our veterans are voting with their feet.  This year of 2019, we have already had 3 million more appointments at VA than we did last year.  The Veterans of Foreign Wars in their annual survey said that 9 out of 10 of their millions of members are completely satisfied with the way VA takes care of them.  And those 9 out of 10 said that they are recommending to their comrades, who are not in VA, to join with us.
We’re also in the middle of the greatest transformational period in our history.  We have launched the MISSION Act — the MISSION Act that finally integrates VA with the entire American healthcare system.  But more importantly, fulfilling the President’s promise, this puts veterans at the center of their healthcare decisions, not the institutional prerogatives of VA, but veterans.
We finally give veterans the option of going into the private sector, if VA cannot provide them the healthcare that they need, or they live too far away from a VA Health Center that would not be conducive to their needs or their family’s needs.
The other thing that we have done: We have finally put our veterans on the same plane as their neighbors.  America’s veterans now have access to urgent care.  We are keeping them out of the emergency room with things like fever, the flu, or a sprained ankle.
The last few months since MISSION was kicked off on June 6th, we’ve had 70,000 urgent care visits.  In addition to that, we’re seeing about 5,000 visits a week.  We’ve certified 6,000 urgent care facilities across America; we want to get up to 7,500.
In addition to what we have done that is visible to the entire country, the President has asked us to engage in fundamental reforms that are less visible to the general public.
Next year, we will be launching the electronic health record.  For the first time, anyone who enters the military through a military entrance processing station will have an electronic health record that will be accessible to VA once that young American leaves the service.  For the first time, we will prevent people, like my father, after 30 years of military service, from carting around an 800-page paper record, and we will have an entire history of that veteran’s service stateside, in war, and overseas.
The other things that we have been doing: We have reformed our supply chain; we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Defense to finally computerize and nationalize VA supply chain.  So we will no longer have stories about doctors at DCVA running across the street to MedStar to get equipment that they should have had to begin with.  In addition to that, we are reforming our HR system.
One of the things that I discovered when I began service on August 1st — I asked a fundamental military question to senior leaders in our department: How many people do we have on the rolls?  I got two different answers.  And I asked for a manning document.  In the military, a manning document is a system of requirements, and the number of people you meet need to have those requirements met.  We now have a manning document.
In addition to that: Accountability.  In this President’s term, we have we have relieved over 8,000 employees of their duty at VA.  The standard is, if you don’t live up to your oath, if you don’t live up to the standards that our veterans expect, that you will be asked to leave.  This is a transformational moment in our history.  We have relieved people as high as network directors to people at the other end of our employee chain.  After the scandals of Phoenix, the scandals of 2014 and 2015, this is, I think, one of the strongest statements that we can make: that it is a new day at VA.
And, finally, two other things about transformation:
On the opioid front, we have not been immune to the crisis that has impacted the United States.  But in the last year and a half, we have reduced the number of opioid prescriptions at VA by 51 percent.  We have offered, for the first time, alternative therapies that, in my father’s day, would have been anathema to the ethos.  We now tell soldiers: Come in and try acupuncture, tai chi, yoga, music therapy.  We’re getting at the sources of the pain rather than treating the brain as we have with traditional opioid therapies.
And the last thing is suicide.  A bit of a history lesson: The United States Army began taking statistics on suicide during the administration of Benjamin Harrison, who is only known for one thing: He was in-between two non-successive terms of Grover Cleveland.  But Harrison, having been a general in the Civil War, recognized that there was a crisis in the frontier army.  This is the first time that we have begun a national conversation about suicide prevention.
Fourteen — 60 percent — of those warriors who take their lives on a daily basis are not in VA.  So we are calling for a national roadmap.  I will have a report for you sometime in March, where we bring together Indian Health, HHS, HUD, DOD, and the rest of the federal government to actually begin a national conversation, long overdue, on mental health and addiction.
So I will conclude by saying that we have never had a President who has given this much attention and this much effort to those who have borne the battle.  And it is my honor to be part of their team.
And I will stop.  Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-veterans-affairs-robert-wilkie/

12:39 P.M. EDT
MR. MULVANEY:  Hey, guys.  How are you all?
First thing’s first: I want to comment very briefly on Mr. Cummings’s passing.  For those of you who know, I was in Congress for a couple years with Mr. Cummings, and — on the committee with him.  I had a chance to work with him on a day in, day out basis.  And he will be missed.  He was — he was a classy guy, and I enjoyed much working with him.  And the condolences from my family and all of the White House group to his family today.  He will be — he will be sorely missed.
Now, getting on to the business at hand, I understand it’s been a fairly slow news week — (laughter) — so I thought we’d introduce a couple of things.
I did want to come out here with my Nationals hat on, but they told me that that would violate some type of rule, so I couldn’t do that.  I was also going to wear my Montreal Expos hat, and then they said that would be foreign interference in the World Series, so I can’t do that either.
So we’re going to talk about the G7.  We’re going to talk about where we’re going to do it.  We’re going to announce today that we’re going to do the 46th G7 Summit on June 10th through June 12th at the Trump National Doral facility in Miami, Florida.
The focus of the event will be global growth and challenges to the global economy, specifically dealing with things like rejuvenating incentives for growth and prosperity; rolling back prosperity-killing regulations; ending trade barriers; and re-opening energy markets.  So, taking a lot of what we have been doing here domestically with such success and trying to encourage the rest of the world to get onboard as we sit here and our economy does so well.  You look all across the world right now, and the rest of the world is either at or near recession.  And we really do think that we have hit on a formula that works not only here but that would work overseas, where we take the G7 as the opportunity to try and convince other nations that they can have the same successes by following the same model.
Now, let’s talk about the site selection process because I know you folks will ask some questions about that.  How do we go about doing this?  First of all, we use a lot of the same criteria that have been used by past administrations.  There’s a long list of the accommodations on site: the ballrooms, bilateral rooms, the number of rooms, the photo ops, the support hotels that are there, the proximity to cities and airports, helicopter landing zones, medical facilities, et cetera.
So we use the same set of criteria that previous administrations have used.  We started with a list of about a dozen, just on paper.  And we sent an advance team out to actually visit 10 locations in several states.  We visited California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah.  Now, we got that list down to just under 10, and the advance team went out to visit those.  And from there, we got down to four finalists that our senior team went out to look at.  They looked at — I think it was one in Hawaii, two in Utah, and then the Mar-a-Lago facility in Florida.
And it became apparent at the end of that process that Doral was, by far and away — far and away — the best physical facility for this meeting.  In fact, I was talking to one of the advance teams when they came back, and I said, “What was it like?”  And they said, “Mick, you’re not going to believe this, but it’s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event.”  If any of you have been there, you know that there’s separate buildings with their own rooms, separate and apart from each building, so that one country can have a building, another country can have another, you folks could have your building for the press.  And obviously, the common areas are going to be perfect for our needs down there.
Again, anticipating your questions: How is this not an emoluments violation?  Is the President going to profit from this?  I think the President has pretty much made it very clear since he’s got here that he doesn’t profit from being here.  He has no interest in profit from being here.  It’s one of the reasons that he’s not taken a salary since he’s been here.  He’s given that salary to charity.  Will not be profiting here.
We had talked about the possibility of whether or not the President could actually do it at no cost, to understand there’s difficulties with doing it that way.  But we’ll also have difficulties, obviously, if they charge market rates.  So they’re doing this at cost.  As a result, it’s actually going to be dramatically cheaper for us to do it at Doral compared to other final sites that we had.
So we’re looking forward to that meeting.  Again, June 10th through 12th of next year for the 46th G7.
Now, my guess is, with that official part of the briefing finished, there’s going to be some questions about a variety of things that are going on in the world.  So if we can do something together, that would be great.  Can we take the questions about the G7 first, go through those, and then take a chance to maybe ask a couple questions about the other stuff before the end of the day?

1:46 P.M. EDT
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Hello everybody.  So, I just met with President Trump, and he has authorized and will be signing a new executive order giving the Treasury Department, in consultation with himself and Secretary Pompeo, very significant new sanctions authorities that can be targeted at any person associated with the government of Turkey, any portion of the government.  This will be both primary sanctions and secondary sanctions that will be applicable.
The President is concerned about the ongoing military offensive and potential targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, ethnic or religious minorities.  And also the President wants to make very clear: It is imperative that Turkey not allow even a single ISIS fighter to escape.
Again, I want to emphasize: At this point, we are not activating the sanctions.  But, as the President has said, he will provide very significant authorities based upon the continuing efforts.
So he will be signing this.  They will be active.  We will be working in consultation with the Department of Defense and Department of State to moderating this very quickly.  We are putting financial institutions on notice that they should be careful, and that there could be sanctions.
Again, there are no sanctions at this time, but this will be the broadest executive authorities delegated to us.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-treasury-steven-mnuchin/

11:04 A.M. EDT
ACTING DIRECTOR ALBENCE:  Good morning.  Thank you for making time to be with us today.  My name is Matt Albence.  I’m the Deputy Director of ICE and the senior official performing the duties of the Director.
I want to take a moment before I begin to recognize and thank the sheriffs joining me today: Sheriff Robert Nolan from Cape May County, New Jersey; Sheriff Bill Waybourn from Tarrant County, Texas; Sheriff Butch Conway from Gwinnett County, Georgia; Sheriff Mike Lewis from Wicomico County, Maryland; and Sheriff Chuck Jenkins from Fredrick County, Maryland.
I’d also like to thank ICE Assistant Director Barbara Gonzalez from the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office for the work she does with these sheriffs to support their communities.
Two weeks ago today, I was joined at this podium, as I am today, by sheriffs from around the country: valued partners who understand the importance of law enforcement at every level, working together on behalf of all Americans.
We shared our ongoing frustration with jurisdictions that allow political rhetoric to get in the way of public safety, and the risks and dangers associated with bad laws and policies.
Since then, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ability to enforce immigration law has again fallen victim to judicial overreach.  And our agency’s authorities are being singled out and marginalized in ways that no other federal law enforcement organization has to tolerate.  Tying our hands from the bench does not make our country any safer.
Our commitment to justice is fundamental.  The rule of law is a critical component of our democracy, but a recent ruling handed down by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California holds ICE to a different standard for lawful cooperation and will hinder our ability to faithfully carry out our congressionally mandated mission.
This decision will threaten public safety, as it will lead to the release of criminal aliens back onto the street — criminals that we won’t find before they hurt or, worse, more innocent victims — victims that could have been spared their pain and suffering if only ICE had been allowed to do its job.
For decades now, immigration officers have utilized detainers as a collaborative law enforcement tool to request that other law enforcement agencies notify ICE upon the upcoming release of an alien that has been arrested for a criminal violation completely unrelated to their immigration status.
The detainer serves as a request to hold that person for a short period of time, enabling ICE to assume custody.  ICE issues detainers based on a finding by trained immigration officers that there is probable cause to believe an individual is a removable alien.
Like all law enforcement agencies, ICE utilizes all evidence at its disposal to determine if probable cause exists, including various databases and electronic data.  Probable cause is the same legal standard that other law enforcement agencies must meet in order to make an arrest.
The reality is we live in an electronic age where information is increasingly digitized, and evidence used to support a finding of probable cause will likely stem from databases, to include those that contain biometric data and other similar data sources.
Despite this reality, a judge in California has opined that immigration officers cannot develop probable cause to believe that an individual may be removable based on certain database checks alone.
This conclusion is out of step with the realities of modern law enforcement, endangers the public, and construes probable cause in an unfairly restrictive way.  Moreover, this decision, issued by a single judge in Los Angeles, will impact at least 43 states, threatening communities far beyond the one in which this judge sits.
While I wish I could say this is an isolated occurrence, it is but the latest example of judicial overreach targeting immigration enforcement and the application of laws already passed by Congress, often decades ago.
Time and again, DHS has been prevented from exercising the authority granted to it by Congress because of the decisions of unelected judges who substitute their judgment for that of our legislators or the government officials entrusted with enforcing our laws.
We need people to understand the laws we enforce were not written by ICE.  We do not grant ourselves the power to enforce them.  Our authorities come from the United States Congress; from the laws they draft, debate, pass, and send to the President for signature.  Accordingly, these decisions are not just an attack on DHS and the executive branch, but an attack on the ability of Congress to carry out its most basic function of passing laws for the protection and general welfare of our country.
Our commitment is to strengthen national security and uphold public safety, which we accomplish by enforcing the law as it has been enacted: with the utmost professionalism, despite challenges faced by no other law enforcement agency in this country.
Mitigating some of the challenges faced by ICE through cooperation with our state and local law enforcement agencies in every jurisdiction would make our public safety efforts more effective and our entire country safer.
To be clear, we ask only for the cooperation provided to other federal agencies within the law enforcement community.  We ask no law enforcement agency to enforce immigration laws on our behalf, except those who have volunteered to obtain this authority under the 287(g) program, within which we have 79 valued, trusted partners — some of them on stage with us today.
Despite significant changes in immigration patterns — both legal and illegal — over the last 20 years, Congress has failed to modernize our laws accordingly.  And unfortunately, as we have seen repeatedly in this context, Congress will only act or even acknowledge there is a crisis when it has no other choice.
Congressional inaction in the face of a documented and growing public safety threat is not only an abdication of its duty; it is dangerous to all who reside in this country, citizen and immigrant alike.
As much as I would like to, I cannot stand here today and promise you that dangerous criminal aliens are not being let out of jails to potentially harm others.  In fact, it’s quite the opposite.  And court decisions that negate our lawful authorities only compound this risk.  To be clear, the principal beneficiaries of the recent court decision limiting ICE’s ability to use its detainer authorities are criminal aliens who have been arrested for criminal offenses by state and local jurisdictions.
What I can promise you, however, is that ICE and our cooperative partners will do everything in our power, consistent with the law, to prevent the release of dangerous criminal aliens into your communities, and when they are released by sanctuary jurisdictions, to take them off the street before they can re-offend.
But the threat to your communities remains, and it is real.  ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations officers throughout the country are out there every day, unnecessarily putting themselves in harm’s way, searching for repeat and often violent offenders who were released from custody because local law enforcement is not permitted, or makes the conscious decision to not cooperate with ICE, and a lawfully placed detainer request and warrant are ignored.
A recent case, in a litany of tragic examples, clearly illustrates this danger.  Carlos Carillo Lopez entered this country illegally as an unaccompanied alien child in 2015.  He was arrested no less than four times in the past seven months in the state of Washington, for charges including criminal trespass, theft, malicious mischief, and failure to appear.  Each time, ICE lodged a detainer; each time, the detaining entities — proud sanctuary jurisdictions — released him without notifying ICE.  Tragically, on September 30, 2019, he was arrested for homicide, his victim another young man.
ICE has made approximately 140,000 arrests this year.  About 75 percent of those arrests came from ICE working with the jails and prisons.  The other 25 percent are made by ICE’s at-large teams.  It is critically important work, but it takes a lot more time and resources to make those arrests, at a much greater risk to our officers, the public, and the subjects themselves, when we could have apprehended those criminal aliens from the safe confines of a jail upon their release.
Moreover, ICE’s ability to conduct this at-large enforcement has been increasingly crippled by Congress’s failure to provide sufficient additional funding for detention beds, transportation, ICE officers and agents, and attorneys.
Unfortunately, ICE is seeing its efforts to protect this country undermined by more than just certain courts.  Just last week, the New Jersey Attorney General took another step to undercut how individual sheriffs are working directly with ICE.
We have two partners in our 287(g) program in New Jersey where we have designated and trained local jail officers who work under ICE supervision to identify criminal aliens in their custody.
These partnerships are vital to our success.  They give ICE the operational flexibility to use resources that would otherwise be assigned to those jails, and to be redeployed to target dangerous, at-large criminal aliens — many from neighboring jurisdictions who fail to provide such cooperation.
These sheriffs, in Monmouth and Cape May Counties — elected by their constituents to perform their duties in a manner that reflected their desires — had established a great working relationship with ICE.  But the State Attorney General thinks he knows better what’s for those communities than the people within them.  I don’t understand how an attorney general, the chief law enforcement officer of the state, tells other law enforcement officers under his command to ignore the law.
Perhaps he made a few friends in the statehouse and the Governor’s office, but he surely did nothing to put the citizens of New Jersey at greater risk.  Excuse me, he surely did nothing but put the citizens of New Jersey at greater risk.
The oath of office taken by the men and women of ICE means something to us, which is why we will adapt, like we always do.  Why we will persevere, like we always do.  Why we’ll continue to put our lives on the line to protect the American public, despite the best efforts of those who would like to see no enforcement or open borders.
But make no mistake: Rulings from any individual federal court sitting in a single judicial district but purporting to cripple ICE authorities on a nationwide basis puts people at risk — innocent victims whose lives will be forever changed for the worse all across our great country.  And we could’ve stopped it.
There are more than 3,000 sheriffs in this country, and the vast majority of them see the benefit in working with ICE, honoring our requests to hold someone, or even something as simple as notifying us before criminal aliens are released.  We have done this for decades because it is good policy and it is even better public safety.
I’ll take a few questions, but first I want to introduce Sheriff Waybourn from Tarrant County, Texas, to make a few remarks.
SHERIFF WAYBOURN:  Thank you, Matt.  It’s an honor to be here, especially standing with our brothers and sisters in Immigration Enforcement, along with my fellow sheriffs.  And let me just be clear about this, is that the narrative of trying to go after ICE and Immigrations is very much like the narrative that was used against our Vietnam returning soldiers.  They’re eviscerating honorable people doing noble things, standing on the wall between good and evil for you and me.  And if these people want to change things, Capitol Hill is down the street.  And that’s where they’re changed at.  They’re not the policymakers, but people will often get confused with that.
But drilling down just a little bit, in Tarrant County, Texas — it’s the 15th largest county in the nation — is this morning, we had 4,200 inmates.  Out of that, 7 percent were illegal aliens.  And they were being held for such offenses as murder, sexual assault of children — there was about 70 of them — and there were robbers in there, and kidnappers, and people who committed arson, and people who were DWI.
And out of that, you know, you think about that, if we returned them with this radical ruling out of California, where you have a federal judge making law for the nation, or attempting to, it will put our communities in jeopardy.
Of those people that we have in custody, we know for a fact that 72 percent of them are repeat offenders.  So if we have to turn them loose, or they get released — they’re coming back to your neighborhood and my neighborhood — these drunks will run over your children and they will run over my children.  And if that happens, I know that you will want, and certainly I would want for you, the full force of the law.  And Immigrations is part of that full force.  These people have come into the country illegally.  And I understand that many of these migrants come across that river, down there in Texas, looking for a better day, for something better for their family.  And I don’t think anybody disagrees with that.
But the problem is, the very people that they were fleeing, who preyed upon them, came with them.  And that’s who we’re trying to initially eliminate out of our country.
In Tarrant County, you have to commit a Class-B misdemeanor or higher to even have your immigration status challenged in our jail.  But it’s in our jail that that happens at.  They’ve already committed another offense to get there.
And — but with victims — and there’s plenty of them — and the people that we have in jail are here illegally in the first place.  Then they commit an offense against one of our citizens, and often, some people from their own community.  For instance, aggravated sexual assault on children are not children who are legally here.  They’re their children that are here illegally.  And, fortunately, those people are crying out and we’re taking care of them and treating them as victims.  We work with ICE on those things, and they’re not deported.  We don’t even ask them their immigration status.  We make sure that we can prosecute these people to the full extent of the law.  And once again, that full extent includes their immigration status.
And I — you know, as in Texas, as the Director said, we take an oath of office down there, and it says we will defend the Constitution and will uphold the federal laws.  And anything less than that, such as the Attorney General in New Jersey, I think he forsakes his oath.
Thank you.
ACTING DIRECTOR ALBENCE:  Excuse me, I’m going to have Assistant Director Gonzalez speak briefly, and then I’ll answer your questions.  Thank you.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GONZALEZ:  Thank you, Director.  Good morning.  It’s an honor to be here today representing the men and women of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  First off, I want to say I’ve been with ICE since it was created, and prior to that, I was with Immigration and Naturalization Service.  So I’ve been in public service over 20 years, and I have served in many administrations.
I also help lead the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office, a very important office where we’re helping victims who have been impacted by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration.
I’ve had to hold the hand of too many mothers who have lost a child to a DUI, or somebody else who’s been raped by an illegal alien or someone with a nexus to immigration.  It is a problem.  It is a problem we cannot ignore as a country.  We have the sovereign responsibility to protect our borders.
And the fact of the matter is, while crime happens in America, these people weren’t supposed to be here in the first place unlawfully, in many of these cases.  So, many of these people violated immigration law and then subsequently went and killed others.  It is a problem, and it is one that should not be partisan.
We have people that are being victimized — and not just Americans being victimized; other people from other countries as well that are here lawfully.  And also, individuals that may be here unlawfully, as the Sheriff said, are being victimized or being raped or being abused.
So I really want to impart the importance of this conversation: that public safety needs to come before any political rhetoric.  And this is about public safety.  And, really, I think that everybody needs to have this conversation where, sure, crime happens, but these crimes were preventable because many of these individuals shouldn’t have been here in the country in the first place.
So I just wanted to share that with you.  Thank you.

11:02 A.M. EDT
ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Good morning.  Thank you all for being here today to discuss CBP’s southwest border enforcement statistics for September.
But before I get to the numbers, I’d like to say thank you to the men and women of the Customs and Border Protection for their tireless efforts through Fiscal Year 2019, dealing with this unprecedented crisis.  They do a phenomenal job securing our nation’s borders, enforcing our nation’s laws, saving lives, and maintaining the integrity of our system and rule of law — and doing so with humanity and compassion.
Make no mistake: This country is safer because of their efforts, their sacrifices, and their dedication.
This past Sunday, we lost another Border Patrol agent, Robert Hotten, in the line of duty while he was patrolling the Tucson Sector.  He marks the 129th Border Patrol agent who has died in the line of duty.  He leaves behind a wife and a son.  His dedication — his life — to public service, to protecting this great nation, I can promise you this: He will be missed but never forgotten.
Now, as we’ve been expressing for some time now, this past fiscal year, CBP has faced unprecedented and staggering levels of illegal crossings.  While the comprehensive numbers will be forthcoming with respect to all the numbers and all the statistics for 2019, CBP’s enforcement actions on our southwest border totaled nearly 1 million in Fiscal Year 2019.  This is a staggering 88 percent higher than the number of enforcement actions in 2018.  Eighty-eight percent higher.  These numbers are numbers that no immigration system in the world is designed to handle, including ours.
Arrivals from families to the border in Fiscal Year 2019 more than tripled any previous fiscal year on record.  Our Border Patrol facilities — we’ve talked about this — were not designed to hold families or children.  They were designed as police stations.  And because of that, because of the new demographic of families and children, those resources became strained, and our limited resources had to be diverted from their law enforcement duties, securing the border, to address the humanitarian crisis.  Make no mistake: Our country was less safe because of it.
And what continued to drive and pull Central American families to our borders was the public knowledge that the United States immigration laws are filled with loopholes, often judicially created.  The hundreds of thousands of families and children were told, coached, and made to believe if you make it to the United States border with a child, it was your passport into the interior United States.
The cartels and smuggling organizations, on an almost daily basis, would broadcast that they could guarantee their entry.  All you had to do was pay, all while they exploited our laws and the migrants themselves.
The cartels and smuggling organizations abused them and treated them with nothing more than as a commodity.  This is what we wanted to stop.
We have therefore prioritized developing strategies and introduced the initiatives within the current legal framework that ensured results, restored the rule of law, and closed the loopholes that undermine the integrity of our immigration system.
And this administration’s strategies have brought about results — dramatic results.  While Congress has failed to put forth a single piece of legislation — even being able to introduce it to the floor to address this crisis — we have addressed this crisis.
This September marked the lowest number of law enforcement actions during Fiscal Year 2019.  The total number of law enforcement actions last month was just over 52,000 — down almost 65 percent from the peak in May of 144,000.  This represents the fourth month in a row of a steady decline in apprehensions.  This is an unprecedented achievement.
Last month, it was another decline of 18 percent from August to September, and this marked the fourth consecutive month that the United States Border Patrol alone averaged 25 percent lower in the last four months.
And why have we achieved these significant results?  Make no mistake as well: President Trump has worked to have other countries in the region, like Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, to join us as true partners to come together to address this as a regional crisis that it is.  And that’s exactly what is happening.
Initiatives implemented under this administration, like the Migrant Protection Protocol, or MPP — which was established in accordance with Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act — have brought about the downward trend in border enforcement statistics and strengthened the integrity of the immigration system.
In close partnership with the government of Mexico, MPP allowed for migrants illegally crossing, or at the POEs without documents, to be returned to Mexico to await expedited immigration proceedings in the United States.  If they have meritorious claims, they receive relief in just a few months, rather than waiting in limbo in the United States, sometimes for years.  And if they have unsuccessful claims, they are swiftly returned to their home country, or they can return voluntarily.
Through our partnership with Mexico, CBP has enrolled more than 51,000 people in MPP.  And Mexico, again, being true partners, has agreed to provide humanitarian protections and even work authorizations to these individuals for the duration of their stay.  With MPP, migrants are receiving due process and protection while the United States is restoring integrity to our immigration system.  We’re closing the loopholes and diminishing the smuggling organizations’ ability to profit on the back of these migrants while simultaneously exploiting our system.
Through this and other initiatives, CBP has continued to collaborate with our foreign partners, particularly Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, to address this as a regional crisis, as I said, specifically targeting gangs, human smuggling organizations, and the movement of illicit drugs.  And while the Northern Triangle countries are stepping up to address the regional crisis, expanding their asylum capabilities, and expediting the return of citizens who do not qualify for asylum in the United States, Mexico’s efforts are leading the way.
Mexico’s continued support of MPP and enhanced border security efforts along their southern border, in the interior and along the U.S.-Mexico border, is something really for the history books.  The partnership between Mexico and the United States concerning this regional crisis is having a dramatic impact.  The administration — we continue to enact a network of policies and regulations and initiatives all within the current legal framework.
Unfortunately, as we discussed before, judicial activism by lower courts continuously enjoins these attempts to address the crisis.  The asylum IFR, for example, that requires migrants in the United States along the southwest border to seek asylum in a third country, is governed by current law, yet it was enjoined by a lower court and it took the Supreme Court, just recently, to overrule that lower court.  And I’m here to tell you today, we are instituting that asylum IFR this week.
The Flores regulation is another example, which allows DHS to enforce immigration laws passed by Congress to detain families with dignity and respect during the duration of their immigration proceedings.  It’s actually part of the Flores Settlement Agreement — the law.  But what happened when we tried to introduce that regulation, it was also stopped.
So despite these obstacles and Congress’s inaction, the administration efforts — they’re working.  I’ll give you an example.  Just four short months ago, our daily apprehensions were close to 5,000.  And today, I just looked at it on my screen before I left my office, it’s below 1,700.  We went from over 19,000 people in custody, just four short months ago, to less than 4,000.
We have essentially ended catch and release.  If you come to our borders now with a child, it’s no longer an immediate passport into the interior of the United States.  Instead, they will be afforded a lawful and expedited process, but they will not be released into the interior of United States never to be heard from again.
While this demonstrates an incredible effort, especially by the men and women of CBP, there is more to do.  Seventeen hundred daily apprehensions, as I mentioned, is still unacceptable.
The former Secretary of DHS, Jeh Johnson, he’s been — said several times that, when he was Secretary, a bad day was a thousand apprehensions.  I agree with him 100 percent.  And let’s keep in mind, although we apprehended almost a thousand — almost a million, excuse me — a million individuals this year in Fiscal Year ’19, we estimate — and this is a conservative estimate — that there’s probably around 150,000 individuals who eluded apprehension.  That’s nearly 13,000 each month.
The bottom line: We still need Congress to pass meaningful legislation to address our broken legal framework when it comes to immigration.  And while Congress has failed to bring a single piece of meaningful legislation to the floor, this President and this administration is doing exactly what he promised to the American people.
Now, let me move on to something else: the wall.  Having served as Chief of the Border Patrol in 2016, I proudly support the need and importance of a wall.  CBP, with the help of the United States Army Corps of Engineers is continuing to provide the men and women of CBP what they have asked for to do the job of protecting this great nation on the frontlines.
To date, a total of 71 miles of new wall has already been constructed.  And it’s not just a wall; it’s a wall system integrating lighting, technology, and access roads.  This wall system is essential to our nation’s border security by replacing outdated and dilapidated designs and construction of a much-needed physical barrier in strategic locations as requested by the leaders in the field.  This isn’t what the President asked for, this is what the experts asked for to help them do their job to safeguard and protect this great nation.  The President is — simply listens to them, and he’s delivering his promise.
By the end of 2020, CBP expects to have approximately 450 miles of new border wall system constructed.  And I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again: Walls work.  Our agents know it and the data shows it.  Everywhere we have installed borders along the southwest border, agents gain more operational control, illegal drug and human smuggling activity declines, agent safety improves, and border communities are safer and more secure on both sides of the border.
And the wall just doesn’t benefit border communities.  By way of illustration, in a five-day enforcement action that ended last Wednesday, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 97 illegal aliens in six Midwest states.  That’s important.  Including those with prior criminal histories, conviction for serious crimes: assault, battery, child exploitation, sexual assault, drug possession, hit and run, and weapons offenses.  And again, this was in six states in the Midwest.
This underscores the reality that some of the illegal aliens who cross at the southwest border make their way into the nation’s interior and commit serious crimes.  If we’re going to have a rational and intellectually — and honest debate over this issue, we must acknowledge the public safety issues imposed by some, not all, but some illegal aliens.
The wall serves to impede and increase our ability to apprehend criminal illegal aliens before they make it into the interior of the United States.  That is the truth.
The wall also increases our ability to stem the flow of illicit narcotics into our country.  Last year, we lost 68,000 people to drug overdoses.  The year before that, we lost 70,000 people due to drug overdoses.  And last year, CBP seized more than 910,000 kilograms of illicit narcotics.  Nine hundred and ten thousand.
As an example, the majority of heroin comes from our southwest border, making its way to your town, your city, and your state.
So this further illustrates what goes on at the border impacts every community.  And the wall gives CBP the opportunity to more effectively detect and prevent drugs from entering our country and killing our citizens.  That’s why I always say, “Every town, every city, every state is a border town, border city, and border state.”
Now, let me close by pointing out a couple other additional (inaudible) points of CBP agents and officers.  Every day, they answer the call, putting their lives on the line to protect this nation.  And this isn’t a tagline.  Over 30 years of law enforcement experience, this agency is something — and they do something that I’ve never seen before.  In Fiscal Year 2019, United States Border Patrol agents rescued more than 4,900 people along the southwest border.  Let that soak in a minute.  They rescued 4,900 individuals along the southwest border.
In the midst of this crisis, our agents rendered aid, and, in many cases, put themselves in harm’s way to rescue thousands of peoples whose lives or wellbeing at risk.  When the agents see a migrant family struggling in a river, they’ve answered the call.  When they locate people dying of thirst in the desert, they answer the call.
When our agents and officers see somebody in need, they don’t ask them questions about their citizenship or their migration status; they see a human being in need and they answer the call.  And they’ve done so 4,900 times this year.
These incredible stories play out just about every day along our border, and they deserve our attention.  These stories — and these stories that the American people deserve to know through the news media.
I think now we have time for a few questions.  Thank you.
So, yes, ma’am.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-acting-cbp-commissioner-mark-morgan/

1805,Trump,2019-09-26 06:01:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Acting Director of ICE Matthew Albence,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
11:01 A.M. EDT
ACTING DIRECTOR ALBENCE:  Good morning.  Thank you for joining us.  My name is Matt Albence.  I’m the Deputy Director of ICE and the senior official performing the duties of the director.
Before I begin, I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the dedicated law enforcement professionals that are here on the stage with me.
I have Sheriff Jim Skinner from Collin County, Texas; Sheriff Wayne Ivey from Brevard County, Florida; Sheriff Harold Everson — Eavenson, excuse me — Rockwall County, Texas; Sheriff Matt Saxton from Calhoun County, Michigan; Sheriff Sarah Warner from Hettinger County, North Dakota; Sheriff Jesse James Casaus, Sandoval County, New Mexico; Sheriff Sam Page Rockingham County, North Carolina; Sheriff Dale Schmidt, Dodge County, Wisconsin.
We have Mike Davis, who’s the Deputy Principal Legal Advisor for ICE.  He’s the highest-ranking career official within ICE, also legal advisor, which is one of the most critical enforcement arms within ICE.
And we have Chris Cronen, who is the Assistant Director for Enforcement within Enforcement and Removal Operations.
We are here today to help the public understand the human cost of sanctuary laws and policies which ban and prevent local law enforcement agencies from working with ICE, to include even the simple sharing of information about criminals already in their custody.
Laws and policies like these make us all less safe.  Plain and simple.  This isn’t a political matter, it’s a public safety matter.  And it’s past time to put aside all the political rhetoric and listen to the facts.
And the fact is: People are being hurt and victimized every day because of jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with ICE.  As law enforcement professionals, it is frustrating to see senseless acts of violence and other criminal activity happen in our communities, knowing full well that ICE could’ve prevented them with just a little cooperation.
The type of cooperation we seek is simple.  ICE utilizes a decades-old process in which we all issue an official immigration form, known as a detainer, to advise our law enforcement partners that we have established probable cause to believe than an individual — who, again, has already been arrested for an unrelated criminal violation and placed in that agency’s custody — is an alien whose removal from the United States under this nation’s immigration laws.
The detainer asks our law enforcement partners for two simple things: advance notice of an alien’s release from custody and a brief, continued detention of the alien in the partner’s custody until ICE can be present to take this individual into federal immigration custody in a safe and secure environment.
The fact is that 70 percent of the arrests ICE makes are at local jails and state prisons across the country.  But we used to make more.  And we used to get more criminals off the street before sanctuary laws and policies prevented us from doing so, leaving us with no choice but to expend significant digital resources to locate and arrest criminal aliens and other immigration violators out in the community, including at their homes and places of employment — a more dangerous undertaking for our officers and a more disruptive action within our communities.  And simply put, a less effective method.
There will be criminals we don’t find.  And sometimes, when we do find them, it’s only after they’ve been arrested for another subsequent criminal violation.  Our at-large criminal alien and fugitive operations teams are working in your community every day.  We’d much rather take custody of criminal aliens in the safety of a jail environment instead of sending our officers out to perform the dangerous and difficult task of finding them all over again because a local law enforcement agency has refused to allow us to exercise our lawful federal authority to make an immigration arrest.
There’s a lot of misinformation out there with regard to how we do our operations and what is required.  So I’m going to give a little bit of information and context to dispel some of those myths and misinformation that’s out there.
One myth is that sanctuary jurisdictions, along with many politicians and members of the media continually perpetuate, is that ICE doesn’t prioritize its limited enforcement resources.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Ninety percent of the people that we arrest in the interior of the United States are convicted criminals; individuals who have been charged with a criminal violation; are immigration fugitives; or are illegal reentrants — meaning they’ve been through the immigration court process previously, been deported, and reentered illegally, which is a federal felony and one in which we received 7,000 convictions for last year.
And immigration fugitives, to be clear as well, are those individuals who have had their day in court, have exhausted all forms of due process, have an order to be removed by an immigration judge, and who have failed to comply with that removal order.
Last year, we made more than 105,000 criminal arrests and removed more than 145,000 criminal aliens to include the arrests of nearly 10,000 gang members and the removal of another 6,000.
Many sanctuary jurisdictions will also incorrectly assert that they cannot hand over custody of criminal aliens in their jails unless ICE provides an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge.  Those that say that are either willfully ignorant or patently disingenuous.
The truth is that federal law does not provide any mechanism for judicial warrants to be issued for civil immigration violations.  There is not a single judge, magistrate anywhere in this country that has a lawful authority to issue a warrant for a civil immigration violation.  By statute, Congress has given this authority solely to supervisory immigration officers.  This is one of the ways in which our system — the immigration enforcement system — differs from the criminal justice system.  And it’s perfectly lawful.
If law enforcement entities that have criminal aliens in custody want to release their aliens back to the street, as opposed to cooperating with ICE, they should not justify their actions through a flagrant misstatement of federal law.
The truth is that every community is safer when law enforcement works together.  Some of the sheriffs standing beside me worked with ICE for the 287(g) program, the authority for which, again, comes directly from Congress.  This program has proven to be an incredibly successful mechanism for state and local enforcement agencies to work with ICE, and is responsible for the removal of hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens and public safety threats from our communities.
However, there are numerous other ways that law enforcement agencies can work with ICE.  And the bottom line is that we are here to collaborate with every law enforcement agency we can in the interest of public safety and national security.
To further illustrate, just this week, the dedicated women and men of ICE conducted a targeted, intelligence-based, at-large criminal alien operation.  Many of the subjects we were pursuing had been released from uncooperative sanctuary jurisdictions.  Of the nearly 1,300 arrests made this week, our officers arrested nearly 200 who could’ve been arrested at the jail if the detainer had been honored.
Of the criminal aliens we took into custody this week, three had convictions for manslaughter or murder.  One hundred had convictions for sexual assault or crimes, with the victims of nearly half of them being children.  Seventy had convictions for crimes involving drugs.  And more than 320 had convictions for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
For example, in Boulder County, Colorado, our officers found and arrested a 56-year-old illegal alien who had previously been released from the local jail after his arrest for felony sexual assault on a child.  We had lodged a detainer with the Boulder County jail, but it was ignored.  And he’s again out on the streets, until yesterday.
Regrettably, despite our best efforts, we are not always so fortunate.  Like in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, earlier this year, an illegal alien was arrested for a DUI.  ICE lodged a detainer, but it too was ignored.  Then, in June, that same alien was arrested again.  But this time, it was for two counts of assaults on a female — assault by strangulation, assault with a deadly weapon, and another DUI.  We lodged a detainer again, but it went unanswered.  And Mecklenburg County released him from custody.  Hopefully, we will find him before he hurts or kills another innocent victim.
So far, in 2019 — FY2019 — ICE has lodged more than 160,000 detainers nationwide.  For those that are honored, we are notified in advance of an alien’s release.  The system works, and we are able to place that criminal alien in removal proceedings, or execute an existing, lawful removal order.
On the other hand, if a jurisdiction chooses to become a sanctuary for lawlessness, or chooses to put politics over public safety, we simply won’t know that a removal — often-dangerous, recidivist criminal alien is no longer in law enforcement custody.
What I can tell you, in my almost 25 years of experience, is that we have seen numerous tragic incidents of aliens, being released from custody after having been arrested for a state or local offense, go on to commit other often more egregious crimes.
For those who support victims’ rights — and who among us doesn’t? — how we do tell a grieving victim that the person who hurt you or your loved one that the crime was preventable if local law enforcement had merely honored a detainer, or even given us a phone call?
Who are these sanctuary cities really protecting?  The answer, sadly — and often tragically — are criminal aliens.  Sanctuary jurisdiction proponents have a well-scripted talking point that they like to recite when confronted with the real-world implications of their ill-advised rules and policies.
They proclaim that community trust and local police will be disrupted or degraded if these local agencies work with ICE.  But what these pro-sanctuary advocates do not acknowledge is that when these released criminal aliens commit further crimes, their first target is often the very immigrant communities that sanctuary advocates claim to be protecting.
And what does it say to the victims that do report crimes, when the law enforcement agencies turn a blind eye to the illegality of the person they just arrested and released into the street, knowing full well that ICE was willing and able to remove that threat from the community?
ICE actually has a rare ability within the law enforcement community to prevent crime.  We can arrest and remove criminal aliens before they can harm anyone else again, immigrant and citizen alike.
Now, I want to take the time to thank our law enforcement partners who understand that working with ICE isn’t an immigration issue, it’s a public safety issue.  It’s time to publicly call out those who have put politics over public safety; those who make our communities less secure; who create safe havens in which criminal aliens and gangs are allowed to flourish and can victimize innocent people with impunity.
Today, ICE senior leadership is holding press conferences in sanctuary jurisdictions throughout the country to highlight the dangerousness of these laws and policies.
California, with a recidivism rate among some illegal alien cohorts is 46 percent.  King County, Washington; Chicago; New York City; New Jersey; Mecklenburg County, North Carolina; Denver, Colorado.
You may be the first we’re calling out, but you won’t be the last.  This needs to stop.  Work with us.  Find a way that we can jointly prevent murderers, pedophiles, rapists, drug dealers, and domestic abusers from being released back into our communities.  It’s plain and simple.
To the public who want to live and raise your families in safe neighborhoods, we ask you to hold your lawmakers accountable before you or someone you love is unnecessarily victimized by a criminal that ICE could have removed from your community.
I’ll answer questions in a minute, but, first, I’d like you to hear from a couple of our partners.
First off is Sheriff Jim Skinner from Collin County, Texas.
SHERIFF SKINNER:  Good morning.  My name is Jim Skinner,  I’m the sheriff of Collin County, Texas.  That’s in the northeast quadrant of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
I am the legislative director for the Sheriffs Association of Texas.  And I also serve on the legislative committee for the National Sheriffs’ Association.  So, “howdy” from all the sheriffs in Texas.
I want to first start by thanking President Donald Trump for his leadership seeking rational and meaningful immigration reform.  I also want to thank Matt Albence for his dedication on matters of border security and for his ongoing efforts to remove criminal aliens from the United States.
Lastly, I want to thank the — my fellow sheriffs from across the United States and other law enforcement officials for all that you do to fight crime and protect our citizens.  You put your lives on the line every day, and we’re grateful for you.
All one has to do is look at the nightmare occurring on our southern border to understand that all Americans are safer when federal, state, and local law enforcement officials cooperate with ICE in their efforts to remove criminal aliens from our country.  Not all aliens are DREAMers whose parents brought them to the United States in childhood.  As a matter fact, a substantial number are criminal aliens — persons who have violated other United States law.  And make no mistake, they are a threat to public safety.
Like thousands of other sheriffs in this country, I oversee a county jail.  When I checked the files of inmates under federal immigration detainer request, I find that they’re most often charged with crimes other than being in the United States in violation of immigration laws.  To be clear they’re in my jail because my deputies and other local law enforcement officials have arrested them based on probable cause for violations of state and federal law.
In these circumstances, to help keep our communities safe, it takes effective communications, in close cooperation with ICE, to close the loop.  We know that, too often, in the wake of these criminal aliens, are left nothing but a trail of victims.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet with Angel families up on the west side of the Capitol.  These are folks that have lost their loved ones at the hands of criminal aliens here in the United States illegally.  As I looked into their faces, I saw the pain and the anguish that these people are experiencing because of the death of their loved ones.  They have pictures of their daughters and their wives and their husbands and their grandparents.  And most importantly, their children, who have perished at the hands of criminal aliens.
It makes me ask myself when I see this, you know, what is that oath that you took?  I’m a part of the Thin Blue Line along with every other sheriff and every other law enforcement official in this country — federal, state and local.  I raised my right hand.  I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the laws of this country.  But I expect that, as law enforcement officials, we all understand that and that we all are going to work hard towards that end.
So in spite of the fact that a peace officer may work in a jurisdiction where politicians or lawmakers are willingly ignorant or willfully blind to the rule of law and our God-given rights enshrined in our Constitution, we, the law enforcement officers, are the ones who must ensure that the rule of law is respected and adhered.
My word to them is: Push back.  Be brave.  Remember your oath.  Remember that your first responsibility are those citizens that you serve.  In these times, it’s that collaboration between federal, state, and local law enforcement that best enables us to protect the communities and the citizens that we love.
There’s two ways to cooperate with ICE.  The main two ways, of course, are compliance with the federal immigration detainer request that Matt was speaking about a few minutes ago, and then, of course, participation in the Section 287(g) program. Both of these are vital, and both of these are vital for any community that’s interested in keeping their citizens safe.
To honor our oaths, we have to be willing to work with all levels of law enforcement in order to protect our citizens.  We’re thankful for ICE, and we’re thankful for the invaluable service that they provide to the citizens across this nation.
Like so many other state and local law enforcement officials across the country, I, in Collin County, Texas — I’m better prepared to serve my citizens and my communities because of my relationship with ICE.  We are grateful for the men and women of ICE.  Thank you.
SHERIFF IVEY:  Good morning, everyone.  I’m Sheriff Wayne Ivey of Brevard County, Florida.  I don’t have a “howdy” or anything like my partner from Texas, but good morning.  (Laughter.)
SHERIFF SKINNER:  We’ll send you a hat.
SHERIFF IVEY:  Like all the law enforcement officers standing here with me today, and the many around the country, we’re honored to stand with our Director of ICE and our teammates from ICE as we all work together to combat the illegal immigration crisis that is currently impacting our country.
In order for us to properly address and combat this growing problem, it is imperative that local and federal law enforcement officers work together just as they would to battle any other crime that puts our citizens and our country at risk.
Unfortunately, though, some in our country think that local law enforcement should not work with ICE on this critical issue, and as such, have created the concept of sanctuary cities to block enforcement efforts.
To be clear, the concept of sanctuary cities is perhaps the most ridiculous and outrageous idea I’ve ever encountered in my almost 40 years of law enforcement.  To think that there are those in power who took the same oath of office that we did to uphold the Constitution, who would be willing to oppose the rule of law, is completely insane and unacceptable.
That is why I’m extremely proud of the state of Florida.  As under the direction of our great Governor, Ron DeSantis, we recently banned sanctuary cities, creating a partnership environment for local law enforcement officers to work hand-in-hand with our partners at ICE and CBP.  That same law also mandates that rather than releasing illegal aliens back into our communities, county jails must enter into agreements with ICE to temporarily house persons subject to immigration detainers.
Governor DeSantis further directed the Florida Department of Corrections to join in a federal immigration enforcement program known as the 287(g) that enables permitted law enforcement officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions after they have received the appropriate training.
In addition, our governor recommended that Florida sheriffs across the board participate in the 287(g) program as well as the Warrant Service Officer program, both of which are working perfectly to enhance partnerships between local and federal agencies while making a difference in keeping our communities safe.  I’m proud of the state of Florida for taking the lead on this initiative.
I can’t begin to tell you how important it is for local law enforcement to be un-handcuffed so that we can work with ICE and CBP to enforce the law to combat illegal immigration and to protect our citizens.
I challenge you to find any other crime where elected officials would want federal and local authorities to not work together, where they do everything in their power to stop them from working together on a homicide, on a missing child case, on drug cases, or even human trafficking cases.  The answer is unequivocally, “no.”
They would want them to work together to do everything possible to solve those cases and bring that criminal to justice.  Yet, by creating a sanctuary for illegal aliens to hide, they’re actually protecting criminals who commit homicides, narcotic violations, commit sexual assaults, and prey upon our citizens.
As I said earlier, for some elected leaders in our country to ignore the rule of law and create a sanctuary that protects those who entered our country illegally is not only outrageous but, in my opinion, is criminal and an immediate violation of the very oath they took to support, protect, and defend our Constitution.
It’s time to hold those accountable that create sanctuaries for criminals, and it’s time for Congress to stand with our federal law enforcement partners instead of standing in the way of justice, and most importantly, in the way of protecting our citizens.
In closing, I have a very simple message for those who want to create a sanctuary that harbors criminals and those members of Congress who have become obstructionists in the protection of our citizens: You need to stop standing with criminals and start standing with the heroic men and women who are putting their lives on the line every day to protect our citizens.  Either become part of the solution or get out of our way, because I can assure you that nothing is going to stop local law enforcement from working with our federal partners in the protection of our great nation.  And I mean absolutely nothing is going to stop us.
Thank you, sir.

1906,Trump,2019-09-10 08:30:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:30 P.M. EDT
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Hello, everybody.  So, Secretary Pompeo and I are here today to talk about the President’s new executive order.  And after that, we’d be happy to take a few questions.
So, today, the President signed a new executive order which underscores his decisive leadership in fighting global terrorism.  This administration has intensified our counterterrorism sanctions effort.  We’ve designated more than 230 individuals and entities in 2018, the most designation of any year in the last 15 years.
The new executive order, “Modernizing Sanctions to Combat Terrorism,” which was signed today, greatly enhances our ability to identify, sanction, and deter perpetrators of terrorism worldwide.
Among other provisions, the EO allows the U.S. government to better target terrorist group leaders; provides new tools to pursue individuals who participate in terrorist training; authorizes secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions that have knowingly conducted or facilitated significant financial transactions with sanctioned persons; and targets those actors for, or on behalf of, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.
Utilizing this new executive order, today, Treasury sanctioned over two dozen individuals and entities from 11 terrorist groups.  Specifically, we have leaders, operatives, and financiers from over 11 terror organizations, including Iran’s Qods Forces, Hamas, ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates.
The government has taken more action than we ever have before.  The U.S. is — Treasury is enhancing our efforts to deny terrorists access to the U.S. financial system.  We will continue to make sure that the security of the United States and to protect innocent people from becoming victims of terrorist attacks.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Steven.  Today’s executive order marks the most significant update to counterterrorism sanctions authority since September of 2001.  It significantly expands authorities to target terrorists and those who finance their activities.
Specifically, today’s action amends Executive Order 13224 by adding clauses that allow the Departments of State and Treasury to first directly target leaders of terrorist groups and their associated entities without having to tie terrorist leaders to specific acts.
Second, it more effectively and efficiently targets individuals and entities who participate in terrorist training, and provides new authorities to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that knowingly do business with terrorists.
The Trump administration has already used existing sanctions authorities more aggressively than any administration before us.  And now we’re immediately putting these new authorities to good use, as Secretary Mnuchin said.
Today, the Department of State announces the designation of 12 terrorist leaders.  They include: ISIS Wali of Iraq and former amir of improvised explosive devices; four senior members of Hizballah’s Jihad Council; and leaders from Hamas, Palestinian-Islamic Jihad, ISIS-Philippines, ISIS-West Africa, and TTP in Pakistan.
Further, we’re announcing the designation of Hurras al-Din, an al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group in Syria, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity.
As these actions show, today’s executive order by President Trump adds further muscle to U.S. counterterrorism efforts.  It will help us to ensure that the deadly attacks of September 11 that occurred 18 years ago this week are never repeated on American soil.  Never.

1914,Trump,2019-09-09 08:02:00+00:00,Press Briefing by CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:02 P.M. EDT
ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN:  Good morning.  And thank you all for being here today.
As the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, I’m pleased to announce the official release of CBP’s southwest border migration statistics for the month of August.  And I’ve said this many times: Since Congress has failed and continue to fail to pass meaningful legislation to address the crisis at the border — which would ultimately stop children from being used as passports and end the cartels’ ability to exploit this population, as well as our laws — the Trump administration has taken a number of unilateral actions, unprecedented actions, that we’re going to discuss today.
But, first, let’s discuss the results of the administration’s incredible efforts.  During the month of August, CBP apprehended, or deemed inadmissible, a total of 64,000 individuals.  For July, if you recall, that number was just over 82,000, which represents a decline of 22 percent.
Moreover, the August numbers reflects — and this is critical — the August numbers reflects a 56 percent reduction from the peak in May, which you recall was over 144,000 individuals.
And why?  Why do we see, in 90 days, a 56 percent reduction?  The President has made it very clear that he’s going to use every tool available to him and this administration to address this unprecedented crisis at the southern border.  We have seen historic agreements and policies put in place by this administration; an unprecedented network of initiatives, from regulatory reforms, policy changes, interior enforcement efforts.  The list goes on and on, what this administration has done that resulted in this 56 percent decrease.
In addition to that, let’s talk about the government of Mexico.  The government of Mexico has taken meaningful and unprecedented steps to help curb the flow of illegal immigration to our border.
Now, let’s talk about a couple of numbers.  Mexico has apprehended approximately 134,000 people so far this calendar year.  Last year — 2018 calendar year — the entire year of 2018: 83,000.  That’s a substantial increase of apprehensions that the government of Mexico has executed.
In addition, since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops.  They’ve created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.  Again, unprecedented support and cooperation with the government of Mexico.
But I’m going to tell you, and I’m going to go into a little bit more what the government of Mexico has done, but they need to do more.  And I’ll talk about that in a second.
The international outreach to the governments of Central American countries is also beginning to yield effective and positive results, particularly the efforts to stem the surge of illegal migrants crossing the southwest border and to disrupt alien smuggling organizations.
Additionally, the Northern Triangle countries specifically, along with the government of Mexico, have really joined the United States as true partners for the first time.  They really are seeing this as a true, regional crisis that need continuing coordination, cooperation, and effort — that this is not just a United States problem; that this is a regional crisis that needs regional support and regional solutions.
Third, again — and this goes to the support that the government of Mexico is providing — the Migrant Protection Protocols — or, I’m sure most of you heard, “MPP” — have also helped.  Tens of thousands of individuals arrive at our southwest border every month, many of them attempting to enter illegally.
Historically — we’ve talked about this — these individuals, because of our broken asylum laws, have been released into the interior of the United States as they wait for their asylum hearings.  These proceedings can take years.  A host of reasons: a shortage of immigration judges, backlogs, the list goes on.
Additionally, many never stick to the process and never continue to go through its final stages.  And even when they receive a final order of removal, they still remain in the United States illegally.  Those are facts.
Under the MPP, aliens who are entering or seeking asylum and admission to the United States from Mexico, illegally or without proper documentation, now may be returned to Mexico and required to wait outside the United States for the duration of their immigration proceedings, which take place in the United States.  The government of Mexico has agreed to provide them, while they’re waiting in Mexico, with appropriate humanitarian protections for the duration of their stay.
Here’s a couple of key points on MPP.  It discourages the abuse and exploitation of U.S. laws and non-meritorious or false asylum claims.  MPP also helps promote a safer and more orderly process along the southwest border, freeing up limited resources and helps free up time of those implementing this process to devote to those migrants who may legitimately have a merit-based claim.  As of September 1st of this year, CBP has returned more than 42,000 individuals to Mexico under the MPP.
Now, let me emphasize a point that I made to — a minute ago: Even though Mexico has stepped up unprecedented — they have joined the United States, as well as our Northern Triangle partners, and really stepped up as true partners and really are really seeing this as a regional crisis, and they have stepped up in unprecedented ways — we need them to do more.  We need Mexico to do more.
We need to make sure that they’re sustaining the efforts right now; that the national guard — the 25,000 troops they have deployed — stay on target, stay on task.  We need them to continue to join and expand the MPP, which is a game changer right now with respect to stemming the flow.  Mexico needs to continue to work with our intelligence folks to use information, share intelligence, and develop target enforcement actions at strategic locations in their country.
So they are stepping up in unprecedented ways, but we need them to continue to sustain that, and we need them continue to do more.
Lastly: deterrence.  President Trump is making it clear that if you come to the United States of America illegally, you will be removed.  If you come here as an illegal alien in the United States, if you commit crimes or illegally take American jobs, you will face consequences.
Now, let me talk a minute about the border wall — just a little topic that’s been in the news.  President Trump has made it very clear that we will build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.  And that, as a CBP Commissioner, I can tell you that’s exactly what we’re doing every single day.  Together with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, CBP has constructed more than 65 miles of new border wall.  And it’s more than a border wall; it’s a border wall system.
And now that we have the Secretary of Defense’s authority to use an additional $3.6 billion, we’re hoping to build between 450 to 500 new miles of border by the end of 2020.
But I want to make sure that I emphasize something, as the CBP Commissioner: The Border Patrol field leadership — they want this wall.  This is not a vanity project, as one of the false narratives out there has been, and I’ve heard it numerous times.  This President has delivered to the experts, to the Border Patrol, to the leadership — asked what they needed.  One of the key things that they said they needed was the wall.  And this is not just a wall that’s being built right now; it’s a wall system.  It includes access roads, lighting, technology.
And when asked, the leadership universally has said the wall works.  Where it’s been used in the past, history has shown the numbers go down.  Facts and history show that.  And we’ve been saying for a very long time — the experts have been saying, when they were asked by the President, this wall is absolutely needed to help safeguard and secure our southern border, as part of what we’ve always been saying: a multi-layered approach of infrastructure, technology, and personnel.
And where that is implemented — an effective, a strategic location — it works.  The experts say it works.  The experts have asked for this, and this President and this administration has delivered and they’re going to continue to deliver.  As we stated from the beginning, that wall is an integral part of that multi-layer strategy.
In closing, President Trump has used every tool available to address the humanitarian and security crisis at this border.  The entire DHS family, including USCIS and ICE, are working together with CBP to secure and restore integrity to the immigration system.
And I, as the Commissioner, could not be more proud of the men and women of the Customs and Border Protection who — they support what they do, and their steadfast devotion to their mission and the rule of law, and doing so with humanity and compassion.
And let me summarize by reiterating that we are absolutely encouraged by the downward trend of apprehension numbers, but we know these numbers could always spike upwards.  History has shown that.  We’ve seen it happen in the past.  We cannot rely solely on the government of Mexico or our Central American partners to solve the pull factors created by our broken system.
Unless the laws change, these numbers will rise again next year, just as we’ve seen in the past.  We will again face the same kind of crisis we have for way too long.  Congress must absolutely act to pass meaningful legislation to address the loopholes in our current system if we’re going to have a durable, lasting solution to this crisis.
I’ll take your questions.  Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-cbp-acting-commissioner-mark-morgan/

2024,Trump,2019-08-12 05:02:00+00:00,Press Briefing by USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
10:02 A.M. EDT
ACTING DIRECTOR CUCCINELLI:  Good morning.  It’s a pleasure to be here with you today.  I’m Ken Cuccinelli.  I’m head of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.  And President Trump has once again delivered on his promise to the American people to enforce longstanding immigration law.
Today, USCIS, the agency I head as part of the Department of Homeland Security, has issued a rule that encourages and ensures self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to, or to stay in, the United States.  It will also help promote immigrant success in the United States as they seek opportunity here.
Throughout our history, self-reliance has been a core principle in America.  The virtues of perseverance, hard work, and self-sufficiency laid the foundation of our nation and have defined generations of immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States.
Our current law, which is generations old, recognizes that some new arrivals to our country need the help of their family and community.  It requires come of those, who seek to live and remain in the United States, to have a sponsor who will be financially responsible for them.
In the case of my own family, my Italian grandfather played this role, sponsoring two of his cousins, Mario and Silvio, to come to America.  Once they arrived, my grandfather wanted to make sure his cousins spoke English — certainly well enough to work — and listed my father in that effort, as well, to make sure they could speak English well enough to work.  And they did.
My family worked together to ensure that they could provide for their own needs, and they never expected the government to do it for them.  And the same hardworking spirit shared by countless immigrants who’ve made the U.S. their home is central to our American identity.
This spirit has also been rooted for over a century — well over a century — in our immigration laws, going back to the 1800s.
Since 1996, the law has required foreign nationals to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed.  However, Congress has never defined the term “public charge” in the law, and that term hadn’t been clearly defined by regulation.  Well, that is what changes today with this rule.
Through the public charge rule, President Trump’s administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America.
Our rule generally prevents aliens, who are likely to become a public charge, from coming to the United States or remaining here and getting a green card.  Public charge is now defined in a way that ensures the law is meaningfully enforced and that those who are subject to it are self-sufficient.
Under the rule, a public charge in now defined as an individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period.  For instance, receipt of two different benefits in one month counts as two months.
A public charge in an admissibility determination is prospective and looks at whether an individual is likely, at any point in the future, to become a public charge as we define it in the regulation.
Public benefits are defined as federal, state and local, as well as tribal, cash assistance for income maintenance and small list of non-cash benefits.
Some examples of the public benefits that are part of the rule are general assistance, SSI, SNAP, most forms of Medicaid, and certain subsidized housing programs.  Significantly, the rule does not consider many forms of government assistance that protect children and pregnant women’s health as public benefits.
Generally, this includes emergency medical assistance, disaster relief, national school lunch programs, WIC, CHIP, Medicaid received by people under the age of 21 or pregnant women, as well as foster care and adoption subsidies, student and mortgage loans, energy assistance, food pantries, homeless shelters, and Head Start.
It’s important to note this rule will apply prospectively only to applications and petitions received starting on October 15th of this year.  Once this rule is implemented and effective on October 15th, USCIS Career Immigration Services Officers — what we call ISOs — will generally consider an alien’s current and past receipt of the designated public benefits while in the United States as a negative factor when examining applications.  However, receipt of certain non-cash benefits received before October 15th will not be considered as a negative factor.
The underlying statute passed on a bipartisan basis also requires officers to assess, at a minimum, each applicant’s age, health, family status, assets, resources and financial status, and their education and skills, as well as other factors set forth in the rule in the totality of the circumstances.  The totality of the circumstances means that officers will assess all of the evidence related to these factors, and no one factor alone will decide an applicant’s case.
Most of these factors are the ones Congress mandated us to review when considering immigration benefit applications.  Under this final rule, USCIS will be able to objectively determine whether an applicant is likely at any time in the future to receive public benefits above the designated threshold.
Importantly, this final rule has no impact on humanitarian-based immigration programs for refugees and asylees.  No impact on refugees or asylees.  And it clarifies the exemption for trafficking victims and victims of domestic violence.  Congress has long carved out exemptions for these categories.  And our regulation adheres strictly to the laws as written.
The final rule also excludes from consideration public benefits received by certain members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their spouses and children, as well as Medicaid benefits for emergency medical services.
Lastly, under the final rule, USCIS can permit an applicant seeking a green card from inside the United States, who is inadmissible only on the public charge ground, to adjust their status to that of a legal permanent resident if they will post a public charge bond.
So, to conclude, I’d just note again that generations of immigrants have strengthened the foundation of our country and making positive contributions today, and we expect that to continue in the future.
Through faithful execution of our nation’s longstanding laws, President Trump’s public charge inadmissibility rule better ensures that immigrants are able to successfully support themselves as they seek opportunity here in America.  Throughout our history, Americans and legal immigrants have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps to pursue their dreams and the opportunity of this great nation.
As President Trump delivers on his promise to uphold the rule of law, this administration is promoting our shared history and encouraging the core values needed to make the American dream a reality.  And with that, I’m happy to take some questions.
Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-uscis-acting-director-ken-cuccinelli-081219/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  President Trump’s 2020 budget, which was released today, builds upon incredible success and keeps his promises to the American people.  It continues the President’s pro-job creation policies, keeps taxes low, combats the opioid epidemic, protects our veterans, defends our nation, and secures our borders.
Even with a strong economy, deficits are still a threat, and this budget demonstrates the President’s vision to restrain Washington spending and reach a balanced budget by 2034.  This is a clear roadmap for a more fiscally responsible future if Congress chooses to follow it.
To talk about the President’s budget proposal and take questions on the topic, I’d like to bring up Acting Director of OMB Russ Vought.
After that, I’ll be back up to take questions of the day.

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Missed you guys.  Under President Trump’s leadership, the United States economy is growing at record levels, putting the President in a strong position to fix longstanding trade concerns with China.
On Thursday, the President will meet with the Chinese Vice Premier who is here this week for continued talks.
President Trump is committed to achieving greater market access for U.S. exports and better treatment for our farmers, ranchers, and businesses.  Fair and reciprocal trade with China will boost long-term economic growth, not only in the United States but globally.
As the President said last week, the United States proudly stands with the people of Venezuela who have courageously spoken out against the corrupt and illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro.  Maduro must do what’s right and allow for free, fair, and credible elections in accordance with democratic principles.
To speak more about U.S. policy towards Venezuela and to take your questions, I’d like to welcome to the podium National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow.
And after that, I’ll be up to take other questions of the day.  Thanks, guys.
AMBASSADOR BOLTON:  Thank you very much, Sarah.  As you know, on January the 23rd, President Trump officially recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the Interim President of Venezuela.  Venezuela’s National Assembly invoked Article 233 of the country’s constitution to declare Nicolas Maduro illegitimate.  This action was a statement that the people of Venezuela have had enough of oppression, corruption, and economic hardship.
Since then, 21 other governments in the region and across the world have joined the United States in recognizing Guaidó as Venezuela’s Interim President.
Today — and I’ll turn the podium over to Steven Mnuchin for this purpose — we’re going to announce sanctions against Petróleos de Venezuela Sociedad Anónima, or PDVSA, as it’s known by its Spanish acronym, the state-owned oil monopoly.
We have continued to expose the corruption of Maduro and his cronies, and today’s action ensures they can no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people.  We expect — and Secretary Mnuchin will go into this in more detail — that today’s measure totals $7 billion in assets blocked today, plus over $11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year.
We also today call on the Venezuelan military and security forces to accept the peaceful, democratic, and constitutional transfer of power.  And to a certain extent, this has already begun.  We have seen Venezuelan official and military personnel heeding this call.  The Venezuelan defense attaché here in Washington recognized President Guaidó a few days ago.  And just within the past hours, the first consul of Venezuela’s consulate in Miami, Scarlet Salazar, has also declared for Interim President Guaidó.
I call on all responsible nations to recognize Interim President Guaidó immediately.  Maduro has made clear he will not recognize Guaidó or call for new elections.  Now is the time to stand for democracy and prosperity in Venezuela.
I reiterate that the United States will hold Venezuelan security forces responsible for the safety of all U.S. diplomatic personnel, the National Assembly, and President Guaidó.  Any violence against these groups would signify a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response.
Now let me give the floor to Steven Mnuchin, who will describe the sanctions that we’re imposing.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you.  Today, Treasury took action against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, to help prevent the further diversion of Venezuela’s assets by former President Maduro.
The United States is holding accountable those responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline.  We will continue to use all of our diplomatic and economic tools to support Interim President Guaidó, the National Assembly, and the Venezuelan people’s
…efforts to restore their democracy.
PDVSA has long been a vehicle for embezzlement, for corruption for Venezuelan officials and businessmen.  Today’s designation of PDVSA will help prevent further diversion of Venezuela’s assets by Maduro, and will preserve these assets for the people of Venezuela where they belong.
The path to sanctions relief for PDVSA is through the expeditious transfer of control to the Interim President or a subsequent democratically elected government who is committed to taking concrete and meaningful actions to combat corruption.
Today’s actions against PDVSA follows my determination that persons operating in the Venezuelan oil sector may now be subject to sanctions.  Today, OFAC also issued a number of general licenses that authorize certain transactions in activities with PDVSA for limited periods of time to minimize any immediate disruptions and support of ongoing humanitarian efforts.
Citgo assets in the United States will be able to continue to operate, provided that any funds that would otherwise go to PDVSA instead will go into a blocked account in the United States.
Refineries in the United States have already been taking steps to reduce their reliance on imports from Venezuela.  Those imports have fallen substantially in recent months.
We have also issued general licenses to ensure that certain European and Caribbean countries can make an orderly transition.  We continue to call on all of our allies and partners to join the United States in recognizing Interim President Guaidó and blocking Maduro from being able to access PDVSA funds.
Thank you.  With that — and I’d be happy to answer some questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-012819/

2962,Trump,2019-01-07 09:16:00+00:00,"Remarks by Vice President Pence, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and OMB Deputy Director Russell Vought in Press Briefing on Border Security",Nan,"Vice President’s Ceremonial Office
2:16 P.M. EST
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, welcome to the Vice President’s office.  It’s my first time to welcome many of you here.  We had a very busy weekend around this table, and I thought this would be a good place for us to catch you all up on the status of our negotiations.  So, thank you all for coming over.You may have already heard that at the meeting of the leadership in the Situation Room on Friday, when the leaders and the President agreed to have our teams talk over the course of the weekend, the President asked me, Jared Kushner, and Secretary Nielsen to lead the administration’s efforts.  And we spent several hours on Saturday in this room, several hours on Sunday, and I wanted to walk you through the status of those negotiations.
We think it was a productive session on both days — I said so on Saturday; the President said so yesterday.  That does not mean to imply that we made progress in negotiations, but I think we gained a better understanding of the issues, the crisis on our southern border, and a better understanding of the priorities on both sides of the aisle to address that crisis.
So, let me — let me give you a quick thumbnail, then I’m going to ask Secretary Nielsen to walk you quickly through the latest information on our border crisis — the security and humanitarian crisis on the southern border.  I’ll walk you through the White House proposal that was presented at the request of the Democrat staff and leadership yesterday and then we’ll get to questions.  And I promise to be as brief as possible.
I think the two things we accomplished over the course of the weekend: First and foremost, on Saturday, we — I believe we made progress in establishing the fact that we do have a humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.  The President will address that as he speaks to the nation tomorrow night at nine o’clock.  And we’re going to continue to make a concerted effort to inform members of Congress in both parties about what we are facing, particularly the precipitous rise in families and unaccompanied children over the last several months that is putting an extraordinary burden and presenting great challenges at our border, as well as the whole issue of the flow of narcotics and other challenges that come.
So that was what we believe we established on Saturday.  In fact, I was struck — at several moments in yesterday’s discussions, a senior Democrat staff actually used the phrase that they “did not dispute” our facts about the border, which I consider to be evidence of a productive discussion, because if we can agree on the facts first, that may always, in any situation, become a foundation for agreeing on solutions.
On Sunday, we responded to a request that we thought was reasonable: That the administration would put on paper a revised budget estimate for the proposals, including the President’s commitment to a physical barrier, to building a wall on the southern border — but also to attach specific numbers and policies to how the President intends or seeks to address the crisis at our southern border.
I’m very proud of the fact that our OMB team and Homeland Security burned the midnight oil Saturday and early Sunday.  And by our meeting, early afternoon — Sunday afternoon — we were able to present the document that I suspect most of you already have in hand.
And as I’ll articulate in just a few minutes, after Kirstjen speaks, what we did in this document was not only articulate, with a great degree of specificity, the President’s request for the budget, but the dollar amounts associated with it, but also we incorporated ideas that Democrat leaders and Democrat staff had brought to our attention over the course of meeting of principals and over the course of the staff meeting.  And we were able to clear with the President those things that the administration was prepared to support.  We added those to our request, and I’ll enumerate those for each one of you.
With that, I want to recognize Kirstjen.  I think we’ve handed out the panels, so we can move through this pretty quickly.  But we at least wanted to begin so that you know the information that we shared with the Democratic leadership staff and represents the best real-time information from our experts on the border about what’s happening.
SECRETARY NIELSEN:  Sure.  Well, thank you all for being here.  We really appreciate you taking the time.
So you do have the slides in front of you.  I’m not going to stop on every stat, because you can read them.  I just want to give you a quick, broader perspective.
So, just looking at the second slide here: As the Vice President underlined, I think what’s important here is there’s a real sense of urgency.  The crisis is getting worse.  So the issue is that the status quo funding, the status quo laws are not able to address the crisis that we’re seeing at the borders.
There’s a few ticks here on why it’s different.  I’ll get into them a little bit more, but it is a security and a humanitarian crisis.  In terms of the solutions we need, those were, as the Vice President described in the letter that you also have in front of us — in front of you — to also include the additional medical resources needed due to the vast increase in illness that we see coming across the border.
So, whenever I give these presentations, particularly to our friends from the south, from the Northern Triangle countries and Mexico, I always start with common cause.  So, where I think we are starting to coalesce is around the fact that we need to be able to protect the vulnerable populations.  We need to be able to protect border communities.  We need to be able to reduce illicit narcotic smuggling.  We need to facilitate legitimate trade and travel, which is part — also part and parcel of CBP’s mission.  And of course, doing all of that within the rubric of national security and homeland security, which is our main mandate.
So if you flip to the next slide, I’m not going to spend any time on this other than to say you all are very familiar with the administration’s commitment to reduce drugs.  There’s some facts on here.  There’s more that we can give you.  We are seeing increased drugs flow across our border.  What you’ll see in the letter in front of you is an attempt to — based on our conversations with the staff and leadership over the last week, to provide a number that would enable CBP to inspect 100 percent of vehicle traffic coming north for drugs.  So that is in that budget proposal.
The next slide, it starts to talk about the part of the security threat.  Some of these numbers you have seen before.  We’re happy to provide a little bit additional explanation on known or suspected terrorists and special interest aliens.  Those are very distinct terms, but there has been some confusion lately so I can focus on that.
What’s not on here that I just want to point out is visa security within the hemisphere is not the same as the United States.  We actually have very strong legislation, very strong authorities.  We are able, through targeting and other means, to begin to understand who’s coming into our country.  That’s not the same for countries in the south.  So part of this is simply — folks can travel to the south, and then they can drive or walk up.  And that’s a part of what we’re worried about.
On the far right, you’ll see $2.5 billion is what is estimated that goes to profit to the transnational criminal organizations.  This is important because TCO’s of course, are massive criminal enterprises.  They don’t just deal with smuggling.  They exploit children.  They deal with trafficking, they deal with drugs.  So this an additional concern:  They are not humanitarians.  This is the main point: Smugglers are not humanitarians.
When you get to the next slide, what we talk about here is part of what’s changed.  Part of what’s changed in the 2,000 migrants that we encounter and apprehend each day is that the vast majority of the flow, for the first time, is made up of unaccompanied children and families.
The reason that’s important is for two reasons: One, that’s the basis of the humanitarian crisis.  The system right now encourages and incentivizes families and UACs to be at the hands of smugglers and to take a very dangerous journey.  Once they get to the United States, our outdated laws do not enable us to process them quickly — to either grant them asylum and help them, should they meet the requirements under the statute, or to be able to detain and remove them if they don’t have any legal right to stay in the United States.
What’s not on here, and I’ll just — one second on it.  The Commissioner and I spent a lot of time working with the Northern Triangle countries.  We’ve been working with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees to increase capacity for asylum throughout the region.  We’re working with the private sector with Mexico every day.  We’re working to stabilize the situation to the south, but this presentation is really about what we need Congress to do to be able to eliminate the pull factors that are encouraging and incentivizing the problem.
The next slide: What’s really different now is, in part, the illnesses that we see.  We have very serious illnesses that we’re encountering on the border.  We are unfortunately having to send about 50 migrants a day to the hospital.  Many times, they are discharged from the hospital.  Unfortunately, we have to send them back because they remain quite ill.  And unfortunately, as you know, we’ve had two children die as part of this journey.  It was the first two in 10 years.  So it’s very indicative of how dangerous this journey is, how sick they are.
The other thing that’s different is when the migrants come through and they don’t come through a port of entry, they’re coming through very remote parts of the border.  So not only is that dangerous for them — walking through a desert, for example — but it’s more difficult for CBP to apprehend them because we have a very long border.  So CBP is doing a tremendous job to save migrants.  They’ve saved over 4,000 last year who found themselves in distress.  But the numbers continue because of the way in which they are journeying.
The last thing I’ll focus on: We’ve talked a bit about a rise in fake families.  We do unfortunately see adults that take children who are not their own, present themselves at the border under the belief that if they present as a family, they can gain entrance into the United States and stay.  So it’s an additional way that unfortunately the system is putting children at risk.
So the three main challenges: We’ve got detention challenges, adjudication challenges, removal challenges.  The one that I’ll focus on that you all have heard from us before is the 1 in a 10 asylum claims are eventually granted asylum.  The reason that’s difficult is because that disables us from helping those who actually need asylum.  The system is bogged down.  There are a lot of others who are coming for other reasons but do claim asylum.  And we have to process them.  So, you’ve heard about the backlog.  What that means are, for those who really need asylum, they’re now in a very long line mixed in with 9 out of 10 who will not be granted asylum at the end of the day by a judge.
So the last slide, this is what we have presented.  In addition to medical resources, which you’ll see in the letter, is our suggestion and a way to address this crisis.  The bottom line is:  This is not a status quo situation.  Status quo solutions from Congress will not work.  We cannot do more with less.
And so, with that, I know we’ll turn it over.  I’m happy to provide any additional information.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thanks.  And whatever questions you all have for the Secretary, we’ll get to that.
Also, these —
SECRETARY NIELSEN:  Yes, sir.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — charts.  I want to send you out with these as well.  I don’t think you have them in front of you, but — are these okay to release?
MR. AGEN: Yes, sir.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  There’s — I think there’s some very helpful charts that give you some idea of the trajectory of the various categories that we’re facing in terms of apprehensions and CBP enforcement actions on the southern border and it gives you an idea of the context.
Okay.  So, again, we’ll come back to questions on that.  Let me shift to what we’ve presented to the Democrat senior staff this weekend and, frankly, what is part and parcel also among the principals, and now has been delivered to all the relevant committee leadership.
Our position is very simply this: There is a humanitarian and national security crisis at the southern border.  The President has been negotiating to open the government and to address the border crisis with resources and reforms.  But we’ll also touch briefly on the fact the President has directed OMB to take steps to mitigate the impact of the shutdown on everyday Americans, wherever possible.  And we’ll unpack that for you before we break off.
But first, let me walk you through this letter.  Maybe if you just grab it, I can breeze through it pretty quickly.  As I said on Saturday, sitting about where you’re sitting, one of the leading staff for the Speaker of the House said, you know, “We hear talk, we hear ideas, but we don’t — you know, we haven’t seen any estimates or a revised budget.”  We frankly said, “That’s fair.”  So we worked overnight and put together a revised budget estimate for them and I’m going to walk you through it.
First and foremost, the top paragraph.  The baseline here is the Senate Fiscal 2019 bill.  Okay?  These are the changes in various categories of that bill, and represent the priorities the President wants to see addressed going forward.
First is, on the subject of border wall and CBP, the President requests $5.7 billion for construction of a steel barrier for the southwest border.  We made it very clear — now in writing, also in our meetings — that the President is prepared to construct a barrier on the southern border in a manner consistent with the existing language in the Senate appropriations bill, a language I believe that 11 Democrats voted for.
And the President also, when he got on the helicopter — all of you were there yesterday.  You heard him articulate personally what we told them in the meeting — that he would support a steel barrier for the southwest border.  This would require an increase of $4.1 billion over the 2019 funding level.
And we also included, by reference here, the CBP’s border security improvement plan, some of which is available publicly because there’s law enforcement elements of it.  Some of it is not available publicly, but if you have interest in getting more information about that plan, it’s literally been on the books for months.  Members of Congress have had access to it.
SECRETARY NIELSEN:  Years.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Various iterations have been on the books for years.  But we were able to say, with a high degree of specificity, here’s the amount of money that we want, here’s what we want to do with it, and there’s a plan in place for implementing it.
Secondly, we called for $563 million for 75 additional immigration judges.  That is the level of funding in the Senate FY2019 bill, but we reiterated that’s our position.
Thirdly, 750 additional Border Patrol agents.  That’s $100 million over the fiscal ’19 funding level in the Senate version of the bill.  Immigrations Customs Enforcement — we’re requesting $571 million for 2,000 additional agents.  This would actually represent an increase of $571 million over the fiscal 2019 funding level.  And it addresses the whole issue of gang violence, smuggling, human trafficking, the spread of drugs in our community, and the personnel level that each of these are derived from what our experts and career personnel at DHS have told us will give us the opportunity to meet the need to protect the interests of the American people.
Next page.  Detention beds at ICE — we’re requesting $4.2 billion to support 52,000 detention beds.  This is a $798 million increase over the funding level in the Senate bill.  And again, it’s informed by the fact that we have border — illegal border crossings have now increased to 2,000 per day.  And, as you just heard the Secretary describe, it’s predominately — the largest percentage of that is families, unaccompanied children.  And so detention beds are a critical need.
You could literally draw a line across the page at that point, because the rest of these items are what I would characterize as “consensus” items.  They were derived from last week’s meeting among the principals — issues that were raised by Democrat leadership to the President, and that the President has processed and now given us the authority to endorse.
First and foremost, in the category of humanitarian needs, we have vetted $800 million to address enhanced medical support, transportation, and consumable supplies.  In the wake of the tragic loss of two children, we also — it was reported to me that we also had an American who lost her life returning from south of the border with one of her children.  So we have increased medical needs and humanitarian support.  We’re prepared to support that.
Next category would be counter-narcotics and weapons technology.  This was an issue that a member of the Democrat leadership in the Senate brought up in the principals meeting, and the President readily directed us to investigate it.  It’s the deployment of detection technology at our ports of entry.  And it’s a — I think the initial request was about $44 billion.  In the discussion among the principals and then in vetting since, we believe that increasing that by $631 million over the ’19 level would meet the need of providing the kind of non-intrusive (inaudible) technology to allow us to get at — and not just narcotics, but also, most especially, about human trafficking issues at the border.
The next paragraph — non-indented paragraph — has to do with another proposal that was brought to us by the Democratic leadership and that, frankly, I’ve heard about in my meetings with leaders of Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.  And that is, they made a request that we consider allowing children to apply for asylum at our embassy in those countries, as opposed to only being able to apply for asylum by making the long and dangerous journey north.
The President and the Secretary of State and I met over that issue, and the President has endorsed that reform that obviously would require a statutory change, along with reallocation of State Department resources in the State Department appropriations bill, but it’s one that we’re prepared to support.  And we also believe that we should match that with one other statutory change that the Secretary just alluded to, which is unaccompanied children who apply for asylum, who, after due process, are determined not to be eligible for asylum, we can return them to their families in Mexico.  Right now, the law allows us to do that.  We cannot return them, even if their families request them to be — we cannot return them to their families in Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala.
So we think — what the Secretary described, is that “pull-factor.”  We think that — by allowing children to apply for asylum in those countries and by making it clear that those that are not eligible for asylum will be returned to the countries, we think that we will take part of the incentive that human traffickers use to take thousands of dollars cash to take children on a long and dangerous journey, oftentimes facing physical and sexual abuse along the way north, to attempt to come into our country to take advantage of loopholes in our laws.
So, this — what I want to be very clear with you is the document in front of you is a result of the discussions that have taken place between the President and the Democratic leadership as well as the productive discussions that took place over the course of this weekend.  And again, you know, I trust that it is evidence that we’ve been negotiating.
Now, for our part, as I said, our position is there is a crisis on our southern border.  We’ve been negotiating to open the government and address that border crisis.  We’re also taking steps to mitigate the impact of the shutdown.  For their part, I will tell you that, from the outset of our first meeting over the weekend, which was professional and direct, the senior staff for the Democratic leadership and the House and Senate simply informed us that there would be no negotiation until the government — federal government was open.  Fortunately, they went ahead and had conversations with us, but their position has been very clear that they refuse to negotiate until the federal government opens.
And now, at this point as well, while a number of their senior staff yesterday did say that they did not dispute the facts that we presented about the crisis on the southern border, you know, what we would welcome and I think the President is going to take a message to the nation tomorrow, is that Republicans and Democrats would come together around the recognition of a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border and the need to take action.
And, you know, the question that I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating?  We made the position of the President very clear, not only in terms of what our proposal is; we’ve integrated some of their proposals.  We also made it very clear, on the President’s behalf that the President is not going to reopen the federal government with a promise that negotiations would begin thereafter.
We really believe that we can address these issues now.  We stand ready to sit down with the Democratic leadership.  The President has not only made plans to address the nation tomorrow night, but he’s extended an invitation to Democratic leadership to come back to the White House to give us their response to the President’s written proposal.  And we hope they take us up on it.  We think the American people deserve nothing less.
We recognize the hardship the shutdown can place on some 800,000 federal workers.  We’ve taken some steps.  I’m going to ask Russ to conclude here by giving you some facts about how we’ve taken steps at the President’s direction to mitigate the impact of the shutdown.
But I want to — I’ll close you with this: That what I said at the end of the meeting yesterday is that this is not about politics.  I mean, when you look at these facts, and I think they’ve got the charts here somewhere that they’re going to pass around — I think even the Washington Post, over this weekend, said that we have a “bona fide emergency” at our southern border; that was their term.  And then they lamented the fact that there was little urgency in the Congress to address it.
So what I want to tell is what’s driving the President and his determination to stand firm and his commitment — not just to build a wall, but to address this crisis with the kind of resources and reforms that will end this crisis at our southern border — that it’s being driven by the facts.  It’s being — it’s not being driven by politics or promises made.
I actually said to the Democrat staff, one of my least favorite terms is the one that shows up the media lot — it’s the word “base.”  I don’t like the word “base.”  It’s your base, our base.  It’s not — this isn’t about base; this about the American people.  This is about human trafficking.  This is about a humanitarian crisis.  This is about the flow of illegal drugs, illegal immigration, and the President’s determination to address that issue with action and with resources.
And what I want to leave you with, with this document, is: You should see this document and this proposal as evidence that we’re listening.  We’re incorporating the ideas of the Democrats.  We just need the Democrats to start negotiating.
But, Russ, can you give us a quick — make it really quick, because I know they’ve got lots of questions and time is short.  A quick overview of mitigation efforts, with regards specifically to the shutdown.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR VOUGHT:  Our mission from the President has been to make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law.  So we have built on past efforts within this administration not to have the shutdown be used to weaponize against the American people.
This particular shutdown, we have made sure that the Coast Guard has gotten paid.  They were not going to get paid.  The Coast Guard got their last paycheck.  We made sure that flood insurance policies — flood insurance, it was heading down a path where no new flood insurance policies would be done.  We ensured that was going to happen.  Park Service — Park Service, not only were they kept open, which is consistent with shutdowns under this administration, but, as of this weekend, we’re making sure that trash can be collected, that waste — the restrooms can be cleaned out, et cetera.
Fish and Wildlife Service refuges will be kept open for the next 30 days.  And then, specifically, I know you all have question on tax refunds.  Tax refunds will go out.  They will not be non-excepted activities.  That’s something that we will be sending out guidance on that we’re fixing from past administrations.
So just to get back to what the Vice President was saying, we have been trying to make this as painless as possible, consistent with the law.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Russ.  We can just go to questions please.  Jon.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-omb-deputy-director-russell-vought-press-briefing-border-security/

3008,Trump,2018-12-18 09:06:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Hey guys.  My apologies for the delay.  We’ll get to as many things as we can before we have to break for the President’s event.
Good afternoon.  As you know, the World Economic Forum will take place in Davos, Switzerland from January 22nd through 25th.  The President will attend, as he did last year.  Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin will lead the delegation, and that will also include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner, and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Coordination Chris Liddell.
On another note, the President is once again fulfilling a promise he made to the American people.  And this morning, the Acting Attorney General signed the final rule, making clear that bump stocks are illegal because they fall within the definition of machine guns that are banned under federal firearms law.
A 90-day period now begins, which persons and possessions of bump-stock-type devices must turn those devices to an ATF field office or destroy them by March 21st.  Instructions for proper destruction will be posted on ATF’s website today.
Lastly, Representative Martha McSally has been appointed to the U.S. Senate, and we congratulate her.  She has been a strong partner in the House of Representatives, helping to advance a number of the administration’s priorities, including rebuilding our military and increased border security.  The President applauds Governor Ducey for his swift and qualified selection, and he appreciates Senator Jon Kyl and thanks him for his service to the people of Arizona.
And with that, I will take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-121818/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Later this week, the President and First Lady will travel to Argentina for the G20 Summit. President Trump’s participation in the G20 Summit is a key opportunity to reiterate his commitment to domestic and global economic growth and prosperity, cement relations with other world leaders, and advance a global economic system that is based on fair economic competition and free, fair, and reciprocal trade.
While at the G20, the President and the delegation will interact — interact with many leaders, including bilateral meetings with the President of Argentina, the President of Russia, the Prime Minister of Japan, and the Chancellor of Germany, and a working dinner with the President of China.
To speak more about the G20 and what the President intends to accomplish, I’d like to welcome to the podium Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow and, following him, National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton.
After their remarks, both will be available to take your questions on the G20 and other foreign policy news of the day. And then I’ll be back up to take other questions on news of the day. Thanks.
MR. KUDLOW: Thank you, Sarah. Thanks everybody. Let me just walk through some quick themes and then I want to mention some things the President talked — talked to us just a little while ago.
As Sarah said, G20 — funny, it’s not actually the G20 when we count it up properly. As Ambassador Bolton points out, it’s much more than the G20.
Now, in terms of the U.S. positions, we’re going to use this as an opportunity to talk about our measures of tax cuts and deregulations, and reskilling and job training, and so forth that have generated significant economic growth and prosperity. And that includes women’s economic empowerment.
As Sarah mentioned, free, fair, and reciprocal trade and trade reform. There’ll be discussions of infrastructure, finance, and also the U.S. emergence as the dominant energy power in the world today, actually.
In terms of the much-discussed meeting — it’s going to be a dinner meeting between President Trump and President Xi and representatives from both sides. It will be a bilateral. I want to just mention what the President told us a short while ago and that is, in his view, there’s a good possibility that a deal can be made and that he is open to that. He is open to that.
But having said that — some caveats, as always — certain conditions have to be met with respect to fairness and reciprocities. We’ve said many times, for example, issues of intellectual property theft must be solved. Forced technology transfers must be solved. Significant tariffs and non-tariff barriers must be solved. Issues of ownership have to be solved.
The President will probably reiterate his view: We want a world, ideally, of zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies. Now, whether they can through all of that remains to be seen but that’s the President’s point of view, as I said just a little while ago.
The U.S. is coming to the summit in very good shape. Our economy is quite strong. It’s growing at 3 percent over the past year. Second quarter was 4.2. Third quarter was 3.5, perhaps to be revised upwards. We’re in a very strong holiday season, so-called “Black Friday.” Very strong.
We’ve had tremendous investments — business investments, energy investments. Oil prices and gasoline prices are coming down. That helps consumers of course. We’re in very good shape.
China, not so good. I’m not here to critique or second-guess the Chinese economy, but most observers believe China to be in a slump, whereas the United States is in a very strong solid position going into this summit.
However, again, to repeat, the President said, there is a good possibility that we can make a deal. And he is open to it. But on the other hand, if these conditions I mentioned a few moments ago are not met and not dealt with — you know, the President said, look, he’s perfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies, which — 10 percent, the last $200 billion — scheduled to go to 25 percent. That’s not a certainty, but that’s the schedule.
And he has said as recently as yesterday, the day before, if need be — if things don’t work out in this U.S.-China summit meeting, he will invoke another 267-some-odd billion dollars in tariffs. That may not be the first choice. I’m just saying that is his view if we can’t get something done.
And things have been moving very slowly between the two countries, until the President himself called President Xi and said, “Let’s restart. Let’s try to get things going again.” And then, since then, he’s made positive comments about that. So we will see.
As I said, the key U.S. goals surround growth and prosperity. And you know, our economy is in good shape; theirs is not.
I’ll just leave it right there. John, do you want to add stuff to that? Do you want me to take some questions?
AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Go ahead.
MR. KUDLOW: You sure? Okay, good. Let me take some questions and try to help out on this.
Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-director-nec-larry-kudlow-nsc-advisor-john-bolton-112818/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  I want to begin today with a few words about the heinous killing of 11 Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Saturday.
As you know, the shooter is in custody, and the FBI is on the scene leading the investigation with the support of state and local law enforcement.
This atrocity was a chilling act of mass murder.  It was an act of hatred.  And above all, it was an act of evil.  Anti-Semitism is a plague to humanity, and it is responsible for many of the worst horrors in human history.
We all have a duty to confront anti-Semitism in all its forms, and everywhere and anywhere it appears.
The American people reject hatred, bigotry, prejudice, and violence.  We are a nation that believes in religious liberty, tolerance, and respect.  And we are a people who cherish the dignity of every human life.
Today, America grieves for the precious lives that were cruelly stolen.  Our hearts ache for every person who lost a loved one.
The 11 Jewish Americans who were horribly murdered represented the very best of our nation.  They were brothers and sisters who looked out for each other.  They were doctors who cared for citizens in need.  They were proud grandparents who taught their grandchildren to value faith, family, and country.  And they were the religious heart of the Tree of Life community.
Our nation mourns the loss of these extraordinary Americans, and we also pray for those who were wounded.  Our hearts are with the four brave police officers who were shot and injured while trying to stop the attack.  We thank God for these officers and for every member of law enforcement who responded swiftly and bravely.
In the wake of the attack, we have witnessed Americans of every faith and tradition coming together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America’s Jewish community.
The President cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country.  He adores Jewish Americans as part of his own family.
The President is the grandfather of several Jewish grandchildren.  His daughter is a Jewish American, and his son-in-law is a descendent of Holocaust survivors.
Tomorrow, the President and First Lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express the support of the American people and grieve with the Pittsburgh community.
And with that, I will take your questions.
Jon.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-102918/

MS. SANDERS: It’s good to see everybody. I missed you. Good afternoon. In keeping with his campaign pledge, the President continues to donate his salary on a quarterly basis to further important priorities. Today, President Trump is proud to donate his 2018 second-quarter salary to the Small Business Administration.
Administrator Linda McMahon is here to accept the check. I’d like to bring her up to say a few words about how the funds will be used. Thank you so much.
ADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Great.
MS. SANDERS: Here’s the check for you.
ADMINISTRATOR MCMAHON: Thank you very much. This is awesome.
Well, I would like to thank the President for his generosity and for his support of the Small Business Administration. He clearly understands the value of small businesses. There are approximately 30 million of them in this country, and I’m very happy to be their advocate.
This money is going to be used in our veterans program. We’re going to establish a seven-month intensive training program called “Emerging Leaders.” It’s an adaptation of that program for our veterans, helping them transition from military life into private sector if they desire to start their own jobs and their own companies, and be entrepreneurs.
So, once again, we thank the President very much for this and it will be put to very good use. Thank you all very much.
MS. SANDERS: Thank you, Administrator McMahon. Now I’d like to bring up National Security Advisor, Ambassador John Bolton, to discuss the withdrawal from the Optional Protocol on Dispute Resolution to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. He’ll take some questions after some remarks, and then I’ll be up to take questions of the day.
Thanks. Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Thank you, Sarah.
Earlier today, Secretary of State Pompeo made a very important announcement regarding the President’s decision to terminate the 1955 Treaty of Amity with Iran — a treaty Iran made a mockery of with its support for terrorism, provocative ballistic missiles proliferation, and malign behavior throughout the Middle East.
Today’s decision by the International Court of Justice was a defeat for Iran. It correctly rejected nearly all of Iran’s requests, but we are disappointed that the ICJ failed to recognize that it has no jurisdiction to issue any order with respect to sanctions the United States imposes to protect its own essential security under the treaty.
Instead, the court allowed Iran to use it as a forum for propaganda. The Iranian regime has systematically pursued a policy of hostility toward the United States that defames the central premise of the Treaty of Amity. The regime cannot practice animosity in its conduct and then ask for amity under international law.
In addition to the Treaty of Amity, I am announcing that the President has decided that the United States will withdraw from the Optional Protocol and Dispute Resolution to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. This is in connection with a case brought by the so-called “State of Palestine,” naming the United States as a defendant, challenging our move of our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
I’d like to stress: The United States remains a party to the underlying Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and we expect all other parties to abide by their international obligations under the Convention.
Our actions today are consistent with the decisions President Reagan made in the 1980s in the wake of the politicized suits against the United States by Nicaragua to terminate our acceptance of the Optional Compulsory Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under Article 36(2) of the ICJ statute and his decision to withdraw from a bilateral treaty with Nicaragua.
It is also consistent with the decision President Bush made in 2005 to withdraw from the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations following the ICJ’s interference in our domestic criminal justice system.
So our actions today deal with the treaties and current litigation involving the United States before the International Court of Justice. Given this history and Iran’s abuse of the ICJ, we will commence a review of all international agreements that may still expose the United States to purported binding jurisdiction dispute resolution in the International Court of Justice. The United States will not sit idly by as baseless, politicized claims are brought against us.
That concludes the statement. I’d be happy to try and answer a few questions. Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-small-business-administrator-linda-mcmahon-national-security-advisor-100318/

New York, New York
11:09 A.M. EDT
SECRETARY POMPEO: Good morning, everyone. It’s an honor to be here in New York for the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, my first as Secretary of State. Kind of the Super Bowl of diplomacy. Americans can be proud of how our entire team is executing on the field today. I’m thrilled to be here with my friends Nikki and John, as well.
Americans expect the United States to assert bold leadership on the world stage that reflects our values. And under President Trump, we are certainly leading from the front.
This was clear from just the first meeting this morning, in which we issued a call for Global Action for the World Drug Problem, the scourge of drug trafficking, narcotics production, and substance abuse is intensifying on a global scale. Within the United States, President Trump is leading a massive and effective counterattack against it. It’s now time for every country to follow our lead.
Later today, the President will hold bilateral meetings with President Moon of South Korea, President Al-Sisi of Egypt, and President Macron of France. Whether it’s security issues, economic issues, human rights, or anything else, the President is asking for countries to exert their sovereignty to solve challenges and listening to what America can do to help.
This emphasis on sovereignty was, of course, the theme of President Trump’s speech to the General Assembly last year. That theme will endure in his speech tomorrow, along with a recap about how his call for every nation to do its part has paid dividends for the United States and the world over this past year.
For example, President Trump’s leadership, combined with efforts of countries to enforce the pressure campaign, has deescalated tensions with North Korea and brought us closer to our final goal: the final, fully verified denuclearization of the DRPK, as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong Un.
Last week’s summit between President Moon and Chairman Kim yielded another positive step forward, but the President remains resolute: Now is the not the time to ease pressure.
And as you’ve heard too, President Trump will address the threat of nonproliferation at the Security Council, on Wednesday, and the need for responsible nations to stop the spread of weapons and technologies.
Among the topics that meeting will cover are North Korea, Syria, and Iran. You can bet the President will have well-deserved strong words for the Iranian regime, which is among the worst of violators of U.N. Security Council resolutions, if not the absolute worst in the world. He’ll call on every country to join our pressure campaign in order to thwart Iran’s global torrent of destructive activity.
Whether it’s Venezuela, South Sudan, Syria, Burma, China, the estimated 2.5 million victim — excuse me, 25 million victims of modern slavery around the world can also count on America’s support. Today is shaping up as a great first day. Lots more work to come this week.
President Trump and our entire diplomatic corps look forward to the days with our foreign counterparts as we work on achieving shared victories for all.
Ambassador Haley.
AMBASSADOR HALEY: Good morning. Happy UNGA. We got a great start today with the President’s event on counter-narcotics.
Really, to understand this event is to understand the fact that it wasn’t just a bunch of people getting into a room. Every country that attended had to sign a Global Call to Action, which basically said that they were going to implement something within their own countries that dealt with how they were going to deal with the supply and demand of drugs, the international cooperation they were going to do with other countries to stop illicit drugs, and then also treatment that can be done within their own countries.
And so the idea that the President was able to get 130 countries to sign on means that we are now having a global drug conversation that needed to be had for a long time.
As we go through UNGA, you are seeing over 140 heads of delegations that are here at the United Nations. We certainly are looking forward to the President’s speech tomorrow. As you can tell, last year we started UNGA and it was trying to figure what the U.S. presence was going to be. This year, we’re here with a bang. Not only is the President doing his speech, he’s going to be doing a Security Council meeting. Secretary Pompeo is also doing a Security Council meeting. The Vice President is doing an event on Venezuela. And so it’s all hands on deck by the United States.
He will be meeting with the Secretary-General. It’s been an interesting time knowing that, since the Secretary-General’s meeting last year, we have pulled out of the Paris Accord. We have pulled out of the Global Compact. We have pulled out of the Iran deal. And all of that is to say that the United States is determined to obviously be involved in multilateral organizations where we see it, but not in the way that they’re mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people.
So with that, he will be hosting the reception, obviously tonight, with the heads of delegations. And then tomorrow night, he and the Vice President and the Secretary have agreed to host our Security Council members, as well as their foreign ministers.
And you know, with everything we’ve been able to get accomplished, whether it’s the arms embargo with South Sudan, whether it’s the idea that we were able to get three sanctions packages passed in North Korea, that we’ve got massive reform efforts that were done this past year and peacekeeping mandates completely rolled over. We would not be able to do that without the Security Council, and so that meeting is going to be very important.
But we look forward to a great week. Everyone is excited. The United States is always very happy to host this. New Yorkers may not be, but we’re going to make it a great UNGA. Thank you very much.
AMBASSADOR BOLTON: Well, thanks. I’m just delighted to be here. Everybody have a copy? I’ve got mine. It’s a little worn, but I still got it.
I just wanted to take a second and talk about one of the themes in the President’s remarks tomorrow. And I have been around long enough to know that I’m not going to step on any of his lines, but he is going to talk and elaborate on his views on sovereignty.
And I just wanted to explain that this is — why this is so important for Americans, because many people consider sovereignty a kind of abstract concept. It derives, obviously, from the word “sovereign,” meaning the monarch. But it’s one of the reasons I think America is exceptional, and that is we understand sovereignty not to be vested in the head of state; we understand it as the Framers said in the Constitution itself: “We the People.” We the people are sovereign in America. So that infringements on our sovereignty are not infringements on abstractions or infringements on the government, they’re an infringement on the people themselves.
We express our sovereignty through the Constitution, through our political process. It’s why that’s so important. And it’s why we believe — and of course, I’m speaking in secular terms here — that the Constitution is the highest authority that we recognize.
So in a number of different ways, the President is going to address this issue. And again, it’s the continuing theme of his — as Secretary Pompeo said, it was a theme in his last address to the General Assembly, it will be this year, and in a variety of other contexts that you’ll see.

MR. MARQUIS: I’m Garrett Marquis at the NSC. We’re here for a briefing that’s off camera, but on record, on the National Biodefense Strategy.
We have Ambassador John Bolton, National Security Advisor, and Health and Human Services Secretary Azar, as well. How this will flow is the Ambassador will make a few remarks, followed by Secretary Azar, and then brief Q&A, which I’ll manage.
We have about 25 minutes, maybe a little bit less. And the focus of this, of course, is on the National Biodefense Strategy, so please make sure your questions are relative to that.
With that, Ambassador Bolton.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-national-biodefense-strategy-091818/

2:26 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. The September jobs report continues America’s economic winning streak under President Trump, evidenced by strong job creation, rising wages, rapid business growth, soaring consumer confidence, and increased manufacturing activity.
To go into greater detail on why the American economy is booming, I’d like to welcome Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to the podium to take your questions on this topic. And, as always, I’ll be back up to answer questions on news of the day. And I apologize in advance for Kevin’s really bad calculus jokes. (Laughter.)
And, with that, Kevin.
CHAIRMAN HASSETT: Thanks. It’s really a great pleasure to be back here. And thank you, Sarah, for the kind introduction.
You know, one of the hypotheses that’s been floating around about the economy lately is that the strong economy that we’re seeing is just a continuation of recent trends. And, you know, since we’re the nerds at the White House, we decided that this is a testable hypothesis. And so what we can do is we can go out and we can estimate recent trends — that is, trends that ran in the economy up to the point of the last election — and then compare the latest data to the recent trends.
In most cases, by the way, the estimates of the trends that we present to you here are very statistically significant, as are the deviations from the trend.
And so now I’m going to, as I always do, show you a few slides. Could I have the next slide, please? That’s the first slide again. There we go.
So the first slide that we’re looking at is small-business optimism. And this is basically — for parallel construction, you’re going to see that each of the slides we go through is going to look a lot like this. And so the blue part to the left of the slide is what happened from the 2012 election through the 2016 election. And the dotted blue line is the trend that President Trump inherited from the previous President. And the red line is what actually happened with the data.
And so, I think that if you look at this chart, you can see that the first thing is small-business optimism. The middle chart is the percent reporting now as a good time to expand. The last one is the percent expecting higher real sales in six months. I think if you look at any of those, you’d say, “Gee, that doesn’t really look like the continuation of a recent trend.”
Could I have the next slide, please?
The next chart is something that, in my first presser here, way back last fall, we talked a lot about. It’s business investment, which is more than $300 billion over the trend. Again, if you look at the blue line on the left, the first chart is nonresidential fixed investment. And the dotted line is the trend and the growth rate to that, that President Trump inherited.
For the middle chart is structures, or buildings. And that, as you can see, the dotted line is something that is headed straight down.
And then, the final chart is equipment investment, and that went straight down before President Trump was elected.
And I think that if anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we’re seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited, then, well, you know, they wouldn’t get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion.
The next chart, please.
Durable goods orders, capital goods orders — it’s a key part of the economy, and it’s one of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes, basically, the good-paying jobs, the jobs that affects normal Americans — blue- collar Americans.
And the first chart is core capital goods orders, and the second chart is core capital goods shipments. And if you look at it, the blue again shows a clear downward trajectory and billions of dollars. And then that trajectory reversed itself completely when President Trump was elected.
If you were going to assert that the current good news is just the extension of a recent trend, then you’d just simply be factually incorrect.
The next slide, please.
Here we’re looking at the ISM purchasing managers index, which is a survey of people who are purchasing managers for manufacturing firms. And so they’re the folks that, you know, as the title suggests, manage the purchases. And so it’s a really great indicator of the economy because you can survey them and say, “Hey, have you been buying lots of stuff this month or have you not?” And the index shows what their responses look like.
And you can see that the trend on the purchasing managers index was pretty much flat when President Trump took office. And the red line shows you what happened since, that there’s a clear inflection right at the election and a clear break in the trend.
Let’s turn to the next one, please.
Now, one of the things that I can remember at the American Enterprise Institute talking a lot about before I came in here was the fact that entrepreneurship in America was falling off. And one of the ways we can measure entrepreneurship is that, if you start a new business, that you have to apply for an ID number — a tax ID number — for your business.
And so, in this chart, we’ve plotted the EIN applications for new businesses. And if you look at the blue line, they were heading up because we were at a recovery, but there’s clear upward trajectory way above the trend at the end.
And, you know, Sarah — like John Roberts — is a calculus geek. And so she looked at that one, and said, “Jeez, that looks like a very strong second derivative to me.” (Laughter.) And then, I said, “I didn’t know you did calculus.” And she said, “I like calculus better than talking to these guys.”
The next chart is prime-age workers reentering the labor force. And again, if you look at the trend, one of the things people said when we put out our growth forecast that said that we’d have 3 percent growth was we said that President Trump’s policies are going to bring factories back to the U.S., give you the capital spending boom that you saw in the previous chart, and that was going to bring people back into the labor force at precisely the right time. Once again, you can see that there’s clear break in the trend.
And so, if you see a break in the trend in the capital spending, the new plant formation that gives blue-collar workers their jobs — go to the next slide, please — then maybe we see a break in the trend in blue-collar workers employment as well. And so this is employment for people in goods-producing industries.
If you look, again, at the blue part on the left, you can see that there’s a clear downward trend going on in the growth rate of that for President Obama, and then a clear inflection timed almost precisely, once again, at the election. And the notion, again, that somebody might defensively attempt to assert that this is a continuation of the trend is almost laughable if you look at this chart and, you know, look at the rest of them.
Now, somebody might say, if you’re showing a bunch of charts, well, gee, maybe it depends on when you estimate the trend. And I’m sure that if you went back and began your estimate of the trend at the Civil War, and then thought about, well, what trend do we get then — well, then, maybe we’re not — yeah, well, you would get a different answer from what we see.
But another way to sort of test whether the data that I just showed you is a fair representation of what a trend looked like when President Trump was elected is just to compare it to what nonpartisan bodies were saying.
So if I could have a look at my final chart here. I know — guys, I heard this sigh of relief when I said “final chart.” So if you look at the final chart, you’ll see that the black line is, in June of 2017, what the CBO — Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that has a job, really, of looking at recent trends and projecting it — what they said would happen to capital spending back in 2017. The blue line is what they said in April 2018. And the red line is what’s actually happened.
And so, I would assert that if you look at the collective body of evidence, the notion that what we’re seeing right now is just a continuation of recent trends is not super defensible. And I think that — I know that we’re in a political time and passions are high. But, as geeky economists, one of the things we have to do is think ahead to what historians will think when they look back at this time. And I can promise you that economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump, and that a whole bunch of data items started heading north. They will, of course, argue for a long time about why that happened.
But my final thought for you is just this: That when they do that, and when you watch people do that in the media going forward, with op-eds and so on, that you should watch out for ex-post theorizing. As an economist, one of the things I most care about is an ex-ante theory — something that happens before, and then let’s watch the data, and then see if it agrees with a theory. That’s how you test a theory.
You might recall that I came back here last fall, and I told you that if we had the tax cuts that President Trump advised that we have, that he pursued — if we passed them, then there would be a boom in capital spending this year.
In fact, we provided estimates at the time last fall that said that capital spending this year would go up about 11 percent because of the tax cuts. So far, in the first half of the year, capital spending is up 10 percent.
And so you don’t have to really reach far for a theory of what happened. President Trump deregulated the economy; we’ve talked about how that affects growth. The tax cuts have had exactly the predicted effect on the economy that’s brought businesses back to the U.S., factories back to the U.S., and created jobs for ordinary Americans. It clear in the data that there’s been a trend break.
And with that, I look forward to taking a few questions before I hand it off to Sarah to talk about other things. And I’ll let Mr. Roberts go first, and then I’ll maybe try one for each row, because I know I’m not allowed to go for the whole time.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-cea-chairman-kevin-hassett-091018/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you’ve all seen, Hurricane Lane is a Category 4 storm that is expected to have a significant impact on the State of Hawaii.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen briefed the President on this hurricane this morning.
We encourage all those in the path of the storm to listen to the instruction of state and local authorities as it relates to evacuation orders and shelter locations.
The President is deeply concerned for the wellbeing of all Hawaiians, and has directed FEMA and administration officials to remain in close coordination with the State of Hawaii and stand ready to support them in whatever they need.
Also this morning, the President had a phone call with Prime Minister Abe of Japan.  The two leaders committed to maintaining strong sanctions on North Korea.  The two also expressed that they look forward to seeing each other later this year at UNGA, and to continue these important conversations with allies.
Lastly, on behalf of our entire administration, I want to extend prayers to the family, friends, and loved ones of Mollie Tibbetts.  The nation has watched for over 30 days as local, state, and federal officials have searched for Mollie, a rising sophomore at the University of Iowa.
Sadly, the individual believed to be responsible for the murder is an illegal immigrant, making this an unfortunate reminder of why we need to strengthen our immigration laws.
The Bible tells us in Psalms that “[The Lord] heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.”  The Tibbetts family is hurting, and they’re on the hearts of all Americans, and we are grieving with them.
With that, I’ll take your questions.  Cecilia.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-082218/

2:34 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  I’d like to begin by reading a statement from the President:
As the head of the executive branch and Commander-in-Chief, I have a unique constitutional responsibility to protect the nation’s classified information, including by controlling access to it.  Today, in fulfilling that responsibility, I have decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Historically, former heads of intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been allowed to retain access to classified information after their government service so that they can consult with their successors regarding matters about which they may have special insights and as a professional courtesy.
Neither of these justifications supports Mr. Brennan’s continued access to classified information.  First, at this point in my administration, any benefits that senior officials might glean from consultations with Mr. Brennan are now outweighed by the risks posed by his erratic conduct and behavior.  Second, that conduct and behavior has tested and far exceeded the limits of any professional courtesy that may have been due to him.
Mr. Brennan has a history that calls into question his objectivity and credibility.  In 2014, for example, he denied to Congress that CIA officials, under his supervision, had improperly accessed the computer files of congressional staffers.  He told the Council of Foreign Relations that the CIA would never do such a thing.  The CIA’s Inspector General, however, contradicted Mr. Brennan directly, concluding unequivocally that agency officials had indeed improperly accessed congressional staffers’ files.  More recently, Mr. Brennan told Congress that the intelligence community did not make use of the so-called Steele dossier in an assessment regarding the 2016 election, an assertion contradicted by at least two other senior officials in the intelligence community and all of the facts.
Additionally, Mr. Brennan has recently leveraged his status as a former high-ranking official with access to highly sensitive information to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations — wild outbursts on the Internet and television — about this administration.  Mr. Brennan’s lying and recent conduct, characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary, is wholly inconsistent with access to the nation’s most closely held secrets, and facilities [facilitates] the very aim of our adversaries, which is to sow division and chaos.
More broadly, the issue of Mr. Brennan’s security clearance raises larger questions about the practice of former officials maintaining access to our nation’s most sensitive secrets long after their time in government has ended.
Such access is particularly inappropriate when former officials have transitioned into highly partisan positions and seek to use real or perceived access to sensitive information to validate their political attacks.  Any access granted to our nation’s secrets should be in furtherance of national, not personal, interests.  For this reason, I’ve also begun to review the more general question of the access to classified information by government officials.
As part of this review, I am evaluating action with respect to the following individuals: James Clapper, James Comey, Michael Hayden, Sally Yates, Susan Rice, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.
Security clearances for those who still have them may be revoked, and those who have already lost their security clearance may not be able to have it reinstated.
It is for the foregoing reasons that I have exercised my constitutional authority to deny Mr. Brennan access to classified information, and I will direct appropriate staff of the National Security Council to make the necessary arrangements with the appropriate agencies to implement this determination.
With that, I’ll take your questions.  Jonathan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-081518/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The images from the Honorable Carry Ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor this month made us all proud to be Americans.
President Trump is committed to getting the almost 8,000 left behind from the Korean War home, and bringing closure to the families who have been waiting for more than 60 years.  The process of identifying and verifying the remains is challenging but one that this administration is committed to.
Overseeing this process is Kelly McKeague, the Director of the Defense for POW and MIA Accounting Agency.  Leading DOD’s worldwide operation of research, investigation, recovery, and identification, and supporting functions, Director McKeague strives to provide the fullest possible accounting of our missing personnel.
The Director, along with his colleagues, Dr. John Byrd, the Defense POW and MIA Accounting Agency Laboratory Director, and Dr. Timothy McMahon, Director of DOD DNA Operations, have joined us today to offer remarks and take your questions on this topic.
After this, I’ll be back up to address other questions and news of the day.  Thanks.
Director.
MR. MCKEAGUE:  Thank you, Sarah.  Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
The August 1st repatriation and homecoming in Hawaii of the remains of the Korean War unaccounted for was a poignant manifestation of the commitments secured by President Trump and pledged by Chairman Kim at the Singapore Summit.
For the families of the 7,700 still unaccounted for from the Korean War, this first step in fulfilling this commitment has undoubtedly provided a seed of hope.
Last week, over 700 of these family members gathered in Arlington, Virginia to receive government updates, and they were resoundingly appreciative of the successful advocacy of the President and his administration.
Two of those family members who attended, Charles and Larry McDaniel, were the recipients of the dog tag their father, Master Sgt. Charles McDaniel, of Indiana.  It was the sole personal effect returned by the North Koreans.
The remains of those 55 cases are well into the painstaking multi-faceted analyses by Dr. John Byrd and his forensic science team in Hawaii.  And in the coming weeks, Dr. Tim McMahon and his dedicated DNA specialists in Delaware will begin their meticulous testing.
The metal of our scientists and the capabilities of our labs will be challenged.  But in the months and years ahead, they will make identifications from these remains and give families long-sought answers.
We are guardedly optimistic the 1 August repatriation is the first tangible action of others with which we will be able to account for more of our missing from the Korean War.
The second aspect of the Korean — of the Singapore commitment was the recovery of remains in North Korea, which DPRK officials reaffirmed last month.  We are in the midst of exploring next steps as well as discussions with the Korean People’s Army for the express purpose of resuming joint field operations and having additional repatriations.
But our mission to search for, find, and account for missing Department of Defense personnel from World War II through Operation Iraqi Freedom is one not limited to the Korean Peninsula.
Today, 186 personnel from DPA and private partners are deployed in seven nations.  And yesterday, 50 of those members returned from Laos and the Philippines.
Our global mission is humanitarian in every respect, because the impact of a missing American to their family is not constrained by time or generations.  And it leaves an enduring pain and void.  This is why former enemies, like Vietnam, used cooperation on the POW/MIA mission as a bridge to normalization in today’s thriving bilateral relationship with the United States.
The fact that the United States of America vigorously pursues the fullest-possible accounting of our missing reflects our values as a nation.
The sacred obligation, if not moral imperative, remains a high priority for the Department of Defense.  Inherent to the exceptional teamwork, resources, and resoluteness provided by multiple agencies is a solemn vow that those were sent off in harm’s way and are missing will not be forgotten.  And their families will receive answers to their decades of uncertainty.
My colleagues and I welcome your questions.

3624,Trump,2018-08-02 08:15:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and National Security Officials,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:15 P.M. EDT
SANDERS:   Good afternoon.  Since the beginning of his administration, President Trump has implemented a whole-of-government approach to safeguard our nation’s elections.  The President has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation-state or other dangerous actor.
Last year, the President signed an executive order to strengthen and review the cybersecurity of our nation and its critical infrastructure.  Last week, the President chaired a meeting of his National Security Council to address ongoing threats.  He asked the officials standing next to me to brief the American people on the work being done to protect the integrity of our elections.
Efforts are underway to provide cybersecurity assistance to state and local authorities, and actions to investigate, prosecute, and hold accountable those who illegally attempt to interfere in our political and electoral process.
To address these matters further, I want to welcome Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Director of the National Security Agency General Paul Nakasone, and National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton to make some comments and take questions on this topic.
As you all know, we’ve addressed what occurred during the 2016 election numerous times and rather extensively.  The purpose of today’s briefing is about what we are doing now and in the future to protect the integrity of our elections moving forward, and we ask that you stay on that topic.
In order to help this run smoothly, we’d also ask that you direct your questions to a specific person.  And with that, I’ll turn it over to Ambassador Bolton to open up and make some comments.
AMBASSADOR BOLTON:  Well, thank you very much, Sarah.  What we’d like to address today is election security in the 2018 election and in the future.  The President has made it very clear, I think, what his priority is.  We’ve had obviously a number of inquiries from Congress on this, including a letter to me, the past couple days from five senators, signed by Senator Schumer and four others.
I have responded to that letter today.  We’ve made copies available to you.  And it forms a kind of framework for the briefing that the four heads of operating department and agencies are going to give you here today.  They are the ones who are implementing and operationalizing the policy that we have developed.  There are other agencies involved, but these are the four primary ones.
And I think it’s important that we address the question of the President’s involvement in this, his leadership, his determination to prevent Russian and other foreign influence in elections.  We meet on this constantly, the senior staff here at the White House.  We meet with the heads of the different agencies involved and we discuss it quite regularly.
In my tenure as National Security Advisor — less than two months — we’ve already had two full National Security Council meetings chaired by the President and, as I say, countless other discussions as well.
Since January 2017, the President has taken decisive action to defend our election systems from meddling and interference.  This includes measures to heighten the security and resilience of election systems and processes to confront Russian and other foreign malign influence in the United States, to confront such aggression through international action, and to reinforce a strong sanctions regime.
Now, as you know, elections are administered by state and local governments, so the federal role is to assist them.  We’ll be addressing that through the comments of the heads of the operating agencies.
I might also say, by way of introduction, that many federal government actions to protect elections in the United States, such as those implemented by the intelligence community or law enforcement agencies, are necessarily sensitive and highly classified.  We do not wish to make the efforts of our adversaries any easier through injudicious public disclosures.  Nonetheless, we have offered to do before, and continue to offer, briefings to members of Congress in secure facilities.
So what I’d like to do here, as Sarah said, is turn the briefing over to the people whose agencies have this responsibility.  We’ll start off with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.  He’ll be followed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen.  She’ll be followed by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher Wray, and then finally, the Director of the National Security Agency, General Paul Nakasone.
So, Dan.
DIRECTOR COATS:  Well, as Director of National Intelligence, I would like the American people to know that the intelligence community and all of its agencies are postured to identify threats of all kinds against the United States.  The President has specifically directed us to make the matter of election meddling and securing our election process a top priority.  And we have done that, and are doing that, and will continue to do so.
We have incorporated the lessons learned from the 2016 election, and implemented a broad spectrum of actions to share more information across the federal government, as well as with state and local governments, and also with the public and the private sector.  The intelligence community continues to be concerned about the threats of upcoming U.S. elections, both the midterms and the presidential elections of 2020.
In regards to Russian involvement in the midterm elections, we continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States.  These efforts are not exclusive to this election or future elections, but certainly cover issues relevant to the election.
We also know the Russians tried to hack into and steal information from candidates and government officials alike.  We are aware that Russia is not the only country that has an interest in trying to influence our domestic political environment.  We know there are others who have the capability and may be considering influence activities.  As such, we will continue to monitor and warn of any such efforts.
I am committed to making sure that the intelligence community is working together in integrating across organizations and missions, and seeking greater transparency with the public.  The ODNI has instituted a broad spectrum of actions covering collection, analysis, reporting, education, and partnerships all designed to provide the best threat assessments to federal, state, and local officials, as well as to the public and private sector when necessary.
For example, my office leads the interagency working group — now meeting weekly, as a push towards November — with the Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, and NSA inclusive of regional, cyber, and counterintelligence experts, all focused on ensuring election security and integration of our efforts.
The intelligence community’s focus right now is persistent support to the FBI, to the Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies in their election responsibilities.  And my office is ensuring these organizations receive timely and proactive intelligence community support.
SECRETARY NIELSEN:  Well, good afternoon.  Thank you all for joining us.  I want to start by briefly mentioning that, on Tuesday, DHS hosted the first national cybersecurity summit.  This brought together government, industry leaders, and academia to discuss opportunities to join forces to counter threats to our nation’s critical infrastructure.
I want to thank all of those who joined us from academia, government, and the private sector; all who participated; and those who signed up to concrete actions to confront cybersecurity challenges.
Across every critical infrastructure sector, from energy to financial services, to transportation, to communication, and so many others, a single attack can have widespread and cascading consequences.  I look forward to working with the nation’s leading minds in the digital realm as we stand up the National Risk Management Center.
But it’s not just risk to our prosperity, privacy, and infrastructure we have to worry about, and that’s why we’re here today.  Our democracy itself is in the crosshairs.  Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and it has become clear that they are the target of our adversaries, who seek, as the DNI just said, to sow discord and undermine our way of life.
I fully share the intelligence community and the ODNI’s assessments of past efforts and those today to interfere with our election and of the current threat.  Our adversaries have shown they have the willingness and capability to interfere in our elections.
DHS has and continues to work closely with state and local election officials throughout the country by offering a range of services to help identify weaknesses in their election systems.  Whether it’s offering no-cost, voluntary technical assistance or sharing best practices for securing online voter registration databases, or providing technical advice on ransomware and destructive malware, our department stands ready to provide tailored support based on each jurisdiction’s unique needs.  This is yet another example where one size does not fit all.
I am pleased to inform you that, to date, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and over 900 local governments have partnered with DHS in order to bolster the resilience of the nation’s election infrastructure.  Various states also have organic capabilities, and are engaging with the private sector and academia to improve the security of elections.
Election infrastructure is not a destination.  It requires aggressive and ongoing vigilance.  Everyone must play their role to ensure that every vote is counted, and is counted correctly — all of us up here today, members of Congress, state and local election officials, and the public.
As all of us up here today gain new insights into potential adversaries and campaigns, we are committed to providing our partners with the government’s best intelligence and information available.  The progress we have made is real, and the nation’s elections are more resilient today because of the work we are all doing.  But we must continue to ensure that our democracy is protected.
Thank you for being here.  And I’ll turn it over to Director Wray.
DIRECTOR WRAY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Last fall, after I — shortly after I became Director, I stood up a new foreign influence taskforce at the FBI, which was designed to identify and counteract the full range of malign foreign influence operations targeting our democratic institutions and our values.
The taskforce now brings together, across the waterfront, of FBI expertise who are talking counterintelligence, cyber, criminal, and even counterterrorism designed to root out and respond to foreign influence operations.
For their part, our adversaries’ influence operations have encompassed a wide range of activities.  So just like we have a multidisciplinary response, that’s because the threat is multidisciplinary.
So just a few examples of some of the things we’ve seen over the past: targeting U.S. officials and other U.S. persons through traditional intelligence tradecraft; criminal efforts to suppress voting and provide illegal campaign financing; cyberattacks against voting infrastructure, along with computer intrusions targeting elected officials and others; and a whole slew of other kinds of influence, like both overtly and covertly manipulating news stories, spreading disinformation, leveraging economic resources, and escalating divisive issues.
But it’s important to understand this is not just an election cycle threat.  Our adversaries are trying to undermine our country on a persistent and regular basis, whether it’s election season or not.
There’s a clear distinction between, on the one hand, activities that threaten the security and integrity of our election systems, and, on the other hand, the broader threat of influence operations designed to manipulate and influence our voters and their opinions.
With our partners, we’re trying to counteract both threats.  We have three pillars to our operational strategy.  The first pillar is our investigations and our operations.  And for a variety of reasons, which I hope are obvious, including operational sensitivities — I’m not going to be able to describe the full extent of those efforts, but I will tell you that our foreign influence taskforce works with FBI personnel in all 56 FBI field offices.  And even as we speak, we’ve got open investigations with a foreign influence nexus spanning field offices — FBI field offices across the country.  So make no mistake, the scope of this foreign influence threat is both broad and deep.
The second pillar — I said there were three pillars — the second is focused on information sharing and intelligence sharing.  We’re working closely with our partners in the intelligence community and in the federal government, as well as with our state and local partners, to establish a common operating picture.
Just last week, as an example, we disseminated a list to our state and local law enforcement partners of various foreign influence indicators for them to be on the lookout for — things like malicious cyber activity, social abnormalities, and foreign propaganda activities.  The idea is to marshal additional eyes and ears in the fight.
We’re also working with our international partners to exchange intelligence and strategies for combatting the threat.  Because this is, after all, a shared threat with our allies.
The third pillar of our approach is based on our strong relationships with the private sector.  Technology companies have a frontline responsibility to secure their own networks, products, and platforms.  But we’re doing our part by providing actionable intelligence to better enable them to address abuse of their platforms by foreign actors.
So this year, we’ve met with top social media companies and technology companies several times.  We’ve given them classify briefings.  We’ve shared specific threat indicators and account information, and a variety of other pieces of information so that they can better monitor their own platforms.
The reality is, it’s going to take all of us working together to hold the field, because this threat is not going away.  As I have said consistently: Russia attempted to interfere with the last election, and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.
This is a threat we need to take extremely seriously, and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus.  And together, with our partners, both those here and some of the other partners we’ve talked about, I’m confident that we can protect the integrity of our democratic institutions and maintain public confidence in our electoral process.
Thank you.
GENERAL NAKASONE:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon.  I appreciate the leadership and support from the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence.
I believe our mandate is clear.  As part of its mission to defend the nation, the Department of Defense is providing intelligence, information support, and technical expertise to the Department of Homeland Security for use by state and local officials to prevent foreign interference in our elections.
This is a vital mission for us and the nation.  It draws on our deep experience and expertise in continuing work on this area.  Our support has been ongoing and will continue through the midterm elections.  We are also providing intelligence and information leads to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on foreign adversaries who are attempting to sow discord and division within the American public.  This information is shared with appropriate entities to alert them to malicious cyber actors.
U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency are tracking a wide range of foreign cyber adversaries, and are prepared to conduct operations against those actors attempting to undermine our nation’s midterm elections.
These type of operations are sensitive and require confidentiality for success.  I won’t discuss the specifics, except to state that our forces are well trained, ready, and very capable.  I have complete confidence in the forces under my command.  We will work in conjunction with other elements of our government to ensure we bring the full power of our nation to bear on any foreign power that attempts to interfere in our democratic processes.  I’ll turn it back over to the moderator.
SANDERS:  Thank you.  As I said at the beginning, if we could stay on topic.  And also, if you could, when asking a question, direct it to a specific person.  And as always, after we finish this part of the briefing, I’ll be back to answer other questions on news of the day.
John, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-national-security-officials-08022018/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon.  Later today, at 1:35 p.m. Hawaii Time, Vice President Mike Pence, at the request of President Trump, will participate in an Honorable Carry Ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor.
The leader of North Korea has followed through on his commitment to return the first set of remains of Americans to our homeland.  These brave souls deserve nothing but our honor and respect.
The families of these soldiers have been waiting for more than 60 years for their loved ones to come home.
We hope that as remains are identified, families like those of Commander John C. Micheel can find peace.
John was assigned to Navy Squadron 125 and was killed while leading a dive-bombing mission into North Korea.
John’s nephew, Doug, who lives in Minnesota, recently wrote the President a letter explaining how his uncle was a special person who grew up in the Great Depression and wanted to serve his country.
Another letter from Mary, in Pennsylvania, tells the President of her uncle, Corporal Andrew Boyer, who has been missing in action in Korea since September of 1951.  Mary has a picture of her uncle hanging in her living room as a reminder of his commitment and service to our country.
Both of these men and their families represent thousands of proud, patriotic American families.  The President is committed to them and will work to bring them the closure they deserve.
On another matter, we have seen all of the alarming images of the wildfires causing severe damage out west.  The White House and FEMA have been actively monitoring the wildfires to ensure that federal assistance is provided as quickly as possible.
On Saturday, the President declared that an emergency exists for the California wildfires.  As a result, FEMA has placed resources from eight different federal departments and agencies to support the efforts of local firefighters and relief organizations.
The President will continue to monitor this ongoing emergency and make sure the people of California receive the assistance they need to keep them safe and recover.  Our prayers are with the firefighters who recently lost their lives battling these fires and their grieving families.
Lastly, the President has been closely following the ongoing situation in Turkey involving Pastor Andrew Brunson.
We’ve seen no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong, and we believe he is a victim of unfair and unjust detention by the government of Turkey.
At the President’s direction, the Department of Treasury is sanctioning Turkey’s Minister of Justice and Minister of Interior, both of whom played leading roles in the arrest and detention of Pastor Brunson.
As a result, any property, or interest in property, of both ministers within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.  For anything further, I would refer you to Treasury Department on that front.
And with that, I will take your questions.  Zeke.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-080118/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  In the two weeks since President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh, he has met with 23 senators.  Unfortunately, all of them are Republicans.  That’s because Senator Schumer is encouraging his members to not even meet with the Judge.
For members of the opposing party to demand answers to questions and yet refuse to even meet with a qualified Supreme Court nominee is unprecedented.  Senator Schumer should stop these political games and meet with Judge Kavanaugh.
We welcome Senate Democrats who take their constitutional duty of advise and consent seriously.  Judge Kavanaugh stands ready to meet with members of both parties.
As you know, here in a few minutes, the President will be participating in an event, and we’re excited to hold the 2018 Made in America Product Showcase here at the White House.  The President is committed to policies that ensure more products are made in America.
Today, we will see items like snowboards made by Never Summer Industries in Colorado, campers made by the Newmar Corporation in Indiana, an F-150 truck made by the Ford Motor Company in Michigan, and baseball bats made by BWP Bats in Pennsylvania.  And a personal favorite, Ranger Boats from Flippin, Arkansas is also here.
The President celebrates every state’s effort and commitment to American-made products, and he is honored to have these companies here today.  And we look forward to having you all join us at that event here shortly.
And with that, we’ll hurry and jump into questions.

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  A couple of announcements.  The President will be traveling to Kansas City, Missouri, next Tuesday, July 24th.  He will address the Veterans of Foreign Wars 119th Annual Convention.
President Trump is committed to our veterans and has worked to reform the VA and to ensure veterans are given the care and support they deserve.  The President looks forward to being with the more than 4,000 veterans in attendance.
Yesterday, the U.S. Senate confirmed Randy Quarles as the Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve.  But it is unfortunate that his nomination was continually delayed.
There are still three more nominees to the Fed who have yet to receive a vote.  It is inexcusable that Senate Democrats have delayed confirming the President’s nominees.
An even worse example of unnecessary delay is the nomination of Dawn Stump to be a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  There is no opposition to her, but yet she has been waiting for 400 days for a vote.  We urge Senate Democrats to stop these unnecessary delays and confirm these qualified nominees.
Lastly, on behalf of the President and the White House, we offer prayers for United States Secret Service Special Agent Nole Edward Remagen and his family, including his wife and two young children.
The Secret Service announced this morning that Agent Remagen suffered a stroke while on duty in Scotland last week and has tragically passed away.
He was a five-year veteran of the United States Marines and spent 19 years with the Secret Service.  The President and the First Lady are deeply grateful for his lifetime of devotion to his country.  And the men and women of the Secret Service make enormous sacrifices for our safety and security, and we are forever in their debt.
And with that, I will take your questions.  Major.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-071818/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  This morning, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force announced the arrest of an Ohio man for providing material support to al Qaeda.  On Sunday, the suspect explained to an undercover FBI agent that he was planning to conduct an attack in Cleveland on Independence Day, and a future terrorist attack in Philadelphia.
President Trump commends the work of the DOJ and FBI for helping stop this would-be attacker.
To continue the ongoing and important work of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, Secretary Pompeo will be leaving for North Korea on July 5th to meet with the North Korean leader and his team.  The State Department will release more details about his upcoming trip.
One item that some of you may have missed last Wednesday in the midst of a busy news day was the confirmation hearing for VA Secretary Nominee Robert Wilkie.
Mr. Wilkie has been twice confirmed by the Senate, most recently last fall by unanimous consent, for his current position as Undersecretary for Personnel and Readiness at the Department of Defense.
During the hearing, Mr. Wilkie not only demonstrated that he has the leadership and experience to lead the VA; he also spoke in depth about how he shares the President’s vision to put veterans first.
Senators Isakson and Tester, the Committee Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, have expressed their support.  The White House expects the Senate to move quickly to confirm Robert Wilkie as the next VA secretary upon its return.
And with that, I will take your questions.

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Many by now have heard that I was asked to leave a restaurant this weekend where I attempted to have dinner with my family.  My husband and I politely left and went home.  I was asked to leave because I work for President Trump.
We are allowed to disagree, but we should be able to do so freely and without fear of harm.  And this goes for all people regardless of politics.  Some have chosen to push hate and vandalism against the restaurant that I was asked to leave from.  A Hollywood actor publicly encouraged people to kidnap my children.
And this weekend, a member of Congress called for people to “push back” and make clear to those serving their country in this administration that they are not welcome anywhere, anytime, for anything.
Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important, but the calls for harassment and push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.
America is a great country, and our ability to find solutions despite those disagreements is what makes us unique.
That is exactly what President Trump has done for all Americans by building a booming economy, with record low unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics, the defeat of ISIS, and the ongoing work to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula.
Earlier today, the President spoke with the new President of Colombia and congratulated him on his recent electoral victory.  President Trump noted the strong partnership between our two countries and discussed the security challenges the new Colombian government will face as he enters office.
We are also working to set up a call between the President and the President of Turkey to reaffirm our strong bond.  We encourage Turkey to take steps to strengthen its democracy and continue progress toward resolving issues in the bilateral relationship.
Lastly, and on a slightly lighter and more positive note, it should be an exciting national championship at the College World Series since the Arkansas Razorbacks will be playing and take on Oregon State starting tonight in Omaha.  So, go Hogs.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Jonathan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-062518/

5:11 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you know, President Trump has laid out an immigration reform proposal that closes loopholes and provides the necessary resources to secure the border.
Congress needs to fix our broken immigration system.  To answer some of your questions on this topic, I’ve invited Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to the podium.
And, as always, I’ll be back up afterwards to take questions on other news of the day.  Thanks.
SECRETARY NIELSEN:  Well, good afternoon.  It is my pleasure to be here because I would love to see if I can help explain some of what’s going on and give you some of the facts.  I know there have been a lot put out there, but hopefully we can clarify some things today.
I just wanted to start by thanking the sheriffs of the United States.  I had the privilege of speaking to them this morning at the National Sheriffs’ Association Conference.  We are so thankful for their partnership at DHS and all they do to protect our community.  So I thank them.
So I want to provide you an update on the illegal immigration crisis on our southern border and the effects — the efforts the administration is taking to solve this crisis and to stop the flood of illegal immigrants, drugs, contraband, and crime coming across the border.
So let’s just start with a few numbers and facts.  So in the last three months, we have seen illegal immigration on our southern border exceed 50,000 people each month.  Multiples over each month last year.
Since this time last year, there has been a 325 percent increase in unaccompanied alien children and a 435 percent increase in family units entering the country illegally.
Over the last 10 years, there has been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims, resulting in asylum backlog to date, on our country, of 600,000 cases.
Since 2013, the United States has admitted more than half a million illegal immigrant minors and family units from Central America, most of whom today are at large in the United States.  At the same time, large criminal organizations such as MS-13 have violated our borders and gained a deadly foothold within the United States.
This entire crisis, just to be clear, is not new.  It’s been occurring and expanded over many decades.  But currently, it is the exclusive product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws that prevent illegal immigrant minors and family members from being detained and removed to their home countries.
In other words, these loopholes create a functionally open border.  Apprehension without detention and removal is not border security.  We have repeatedly called on Congress to close these loopholes.  I, myself, have met with as many members have been willing to meet with me.  I’ve testified seven times.  I will continue to make myself available to ask that they work with us to solve this crisis.
Yet the voices most loudly criticizing the enforcement of our current laws are those whose policies created this crisis and whose policies perpetrate it.
In particular, we need to reform three major loopholes.  Let me quickly walk you through them.  First, we need to amend the 2008 Trafficking Victims Prevention Reauthorization Act, or TVPR — which is much easier to say.  This law encourages families to put children in the hands of smugglers to bring them alone on this dangerous trek northward.  And make no mistake, we’ve talked about this before — this trek is dangerous and deadly.
Second, we need to reform our asylum laws to end the systemic abuse of our asylum system and stop fraud.  Right now, our asylum system fails to assist asylum seekers who legitimately need it.  We are a country of compassion.  We are a country of heart.  We must fix the system so that those who truly need asylum can, in fact, receive it.
Third, we need to amend the Flores Settlement Agreement and recent expansions which currently allow for — which would allow for family detention during the removal process.  And we need Congress to fully fund our ability to hold families together through the immigration process.
Until these loopholes are closed by Congress, it is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States.
Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix it.  Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.  Those who criticize the enforcement of our laws have offered only one countermeasure: open borders; the quick release of all illegal alien families and the decision not to enforce our laws.  This policy would be disastrous.  Its prime beneficiaries would be the smuggling organizations themselves, and the prime victims would be the children who would be plunged into the smuggling machines and get gang recruitment on the trip north.
There’s a lot of misinformation about what DHS is and is not doing as it relates to families at the border and I want to correct the record.  Here are the facts:
First, this administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.  We have a statutory responsibility that we take seriously to protect alien children from human smuggling, trafficking, and other criminal actions while enforcing our immigration laws.
We have a long-existing policy.  Multiple administrations have followed that outline when we may take action to protect children.  We will separate those who claim to be a parent and child if we cannot determine a familial or custodial relationship exists.
For example, if there’s no documentation to confirm the claimed relationship between an adult and a child, we do so if the parent is a national security, public or safety risk, including when there are criminal charges at issue and it may not be appropriate to maintain the family in detention together.
We also separate a parent and child if the adult is suspected of human trafficking.  There have been cases where minors have been used and trafficked by unrelated adults in an effort to avoid detention.  And I’d stop here to say, in the last five months, we have a 314 percent increase in adults and children arriving at the border, fraudulently claiming to be a family unit.  This is, obviously, of concern.
And separation can occur when the parent is charged with human smuggling.  Under those circumstances, we would detain the parent in an appropriate secure detention facility separate from the child.
What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law.  Everyone is subject to prosecution.  When DHS refers a case against a parent or legal guardian for criminal prosecution, the parent or legal guardian will be placed into the U.S. Marshals Service custody for pretrial determination, pursuant to an order by a federal judge.  And any accompanied child will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and will be reclassified as an unaccompanied alien child.  That is in accordance with the TVPRA — a law that was passed by Congress — and a following court order, neither which are actions the Trump administration has taken.
And let’s be clear: If an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to jail and they would be separated from their family.  This is not a controversial idea.
Second, children in DHS and HHS custody are being well taken care of.  The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement provides meals, medical care, and educational services to these children.  They are provided temporary shelter.  And HHS works hard to find a parent, relative, or foster home to care for these children.  Parents can still communicate with their children through phone calls and video conferencing.
And a parent who is released from custody can be a sponsor and ask HHS to release the child back into their care.  Further, these minors can still apply for asylum and other protections under U.S. immigration law, if eligible.
We take allegations of mistreatment seriously.  And I want to stress this point: We investigate.  We hold those accountable when, and if, it should occur.  We have some of the highest detention standards in the country.  Claiming these children and their parents are treated inhumanely is not true and completely disrespects the hardworking men and women at the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Third, parents who entered illegally are, by definition, criminals.  Illegal entry is a crime as determined by Congress.  By entering our country illegally, often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.
Fourth, CBP and ICE officers are properly trained to care for minors in their custody.  DHS and HHS treats all individuals in its custody with dignity and respect, and complies with all laws and policy.  This reinforces and reiterates the needs to consider the best interest of the children, and mandates adherence to establish protocols to protect at-risk populations, to include standards for the transport and treatment of minors in DHS and HHS custody.
Additionally, all U.S. Border Patrol personnel in the southwest border are bilingual — every last one of them.  They are directed to clearly explain the relevant process to apprehended individuals, and provide detainees with written documentation in both Spanish and English that lays out the process and appropriate phone numbers to contact.
And finally, DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry.  If an adult enters at a port of entry and claims asylum, they will not face prosecution for illegal entry.  They have not committed a crime by coming to the port of entry.
As I mentioned, DHS does have a responsibility to protect minors.  And in that case, as well, we will only separate the family if we cannot determine there is a familiar relationship, if the child may be at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or if the parent or legal guardian is referred for prosecution.
We have a duty to protect the American people, and it’s one that I take very seriously.  Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law.  We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.  As long as illegal entry remains a criminal offense, DHS will not look the other way.  DHS will faithfully execute the laws enacted by Congress, as we are sworn to do.
As I said earlier today, surely it is the beginning of the unraveling of democracy when the body who makes the laws, instead of changing them, tells the enforcement body not to enforce the law.  I ask Congress to act this week so that we can secure our borders and uphold our humanitarian ideas.  These two missions should not be pitted against each other.  If we close the loopholes, we can accomplish both.
Before I take questions, I just want to ask that, in your reporting, please consider the men and women of DHS who are dedicated law enforcement officers and who often put their lives at risk.  Let’s remember their sacrifice and commitment to this country.
And with that, I’ll take some questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-department-homeland-security-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-061818/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  On Tuesday, June 19, President Trump will deliver remarks at the NFIB’s 75th anniversary lunch.  NFIB is America’s leading small business association, promoting and protecting the right of Americans to own, operate, and grow their businesses.
The President will highlight the strong American economy and tout the benefits we are seeing from tax reform and deregulation, including that small business optimism has hit its highest level in more than 30 years.
As you know, National Economic Council Director and Assistant to the President Larry Kudlow was discharged from the hospital and is recovering at home.  The President has spoken with Larry and he’s in good spirits.  We look forward to having him back here at the White House soon.
Tonight at Nationals Park, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will put aside their political differences to play America’s game.
After last year’s horrible shooting at the GOP practice, where Capitol Police acted heroically in the line of fire to save lives, we are excited to see those who were injured return to the field, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise.
Those injured have fought hard for this moment and we will proudly be cheering them on.  I have heard the Republican team looks good in practice and that they’re headed for a victory.
Lastly, on June 14th we celebrate Flag Day, commemorating the adoption of our American flag, which we all proudly stand for, the founding of our brave U.S. Army.
And last but certainly not least, we would like to wish the President a very, very happy birthday.  And if I do say so, I don’t think he looks a day over 35.  (Laughter.)
With that, I’ll take your questions.

Singapore
5:42 P.M. SGT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Thank you so much for your patience.  It’s certainly worth the wait.  Welcome to Singapore and the filing center here.  We’ll keep this short.
I’d like to welcome the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who will answer questions specific to the summit that will take place tomorrow.  And we’ll be around to follow up with other questions beyond that.  Thanks so much.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Good afternoon.  I want to give an update in advance of President Trump’s summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un.  As the President said on Saturday, this is truly a mission of peace.
This afternoon, the President called Prime Minister Abe of Japan and President Moon of South Korea.  Earlier today, our Ambassador, Sung Kim, led a delegation to meet with Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and his North Korean — or excuse me, her North Korean delegation.  The talks continue this afternoon, even as we sit here now.  They’re, in fact, moving quite rapidly.  And we anticipate they will come to their logical conclusion even more quickly than we had anticipated.
Before discussing the summit, I want to address a report in The New York Times that suggested that the U.S. team lacks the technical expertise on dismantling North Korea’s weapons program as part of these talks.  I want to address that report directly.
For over three months, an interagency working group of over 100 experts across government has met multiple times per week to address technical and logistical issues associated with dismantling North Korea’s weapons programs.  They include experts from the military charged with dismantling nuclear weapons; the Department of Energy, including PhDs and experts from DOE labs; and officials from the intelligence community covering North Korea.  Those same experts also cover North Korea’s nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile programs.
These experts include dozens of PhDs who have expertise in nuclear weapons, the fuel cycle, missiles, chemical and biological weapons.  They have advanced degrees in nuclear engineering, physics, chemistry, aerospace, biology, and other relevant fields.
On the ground in Singapore, we have a team that includes the President’s senior most expert in weapons of mass destruction who can cover any technical needs that the meetings may present.
Any suggestion that the United States somehow lacks the technical expertise across government or lacks it on the ground here in Singapore is mistaken.
North Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearize, and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere.  The fact that our two leaders are sitting down face to face is a sign of the enormous potential to accomplish something that will immensely benefit both of our peoples and the entire world.
President Trump believes that Kim Jong Un has an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of our relationship and bring peace and prosperity to his country.  We are hopeful this summit will have set the conditions for future productive talks.  In light of how many flimsy agreements the United States has made in previous years, this President will ensure that no potential agreement will fail to adequately address the North Korean threat.
The ultimate objective we seek from diplomacy with North Korea has not changed.  The complete and verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept.  Sanctions will remain until North Korea completely and verifiably eliminates its weapons of mass destruction programs.  If diplomacy does not move in the right direction — and we are hopeful that it will continue to do so — those measures will increase.
President Trump recognizes Chairman Kim’s desire for security, and is prepared to ensure that a North Korea free of weapons of mass destruction is also a secure North Korea.  The President has also expressed his openness to expanding access to foreign investment and other economic opportunities for North Korea if they take the right steps.
All the preparations for the summit have come together very nicely.  The President met this afternoon with Minister Lee of Singapore.  It was an important opportunity to thank the Prime Minister of Singapore for his partnership in helping make this summit a reality.  Singapore is home to over 4,000 American companies and is a longstanding commercial partner, and we thank them for their help in making this summit what it is.
The President also had a chance to visit with our embassy team here in Singapore and thank them for their tireless work to make this summit a success.  For example, at tomorrow’s summit, there will be some 5,000 members of the media from all over the world that will be covering this historic event.
President Trump is going into this meeting with confidence, a positive attitude, and eagerness for real progress.  He has made it clear that if Kim Jong Un denuclearizes, there is a brighter future for North Korea.  Tomorrow, we will get our clearest indication to date of whether Chairman Kim Jong Un truly shares this vision.
I’m happy to take a couple questions.

1:10 P.M. EDT
KUDLOW:  Hello, everybody.  I’m Larry Kudlow.  So some brief stuff on the G7 meeting in Charlevoix.  My high school French pronunciation.  Is it any good?
Basically, the key points: Number one, economic growth.  The United States now has the fastest growing economy in the world, according to the OECD, or at least the fasting growing economy among the industrialized nations.
Second, there will be trade discussions, as you might imagine.
Third, there will be some important bilateral meetings.  President Trump will be meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron.  Important bilaterals.
And finally, I think one of the key points, of course, on the eve of the North Korean summit in Singapore — one of the key points will be shared security issues among the allies.
And if I may, just perhaps because it’s my favorite subject, the United States economy is growing.  We’re pushing through 3 percent.  Some said it couldn’t be done.  It is being done, and we’re proud of it.  And I think President Trump’s policies of lower taxes and major regulatory rollback are a key part of this issue.  And I also think his role as probably the strongest trade reformer of the past 20 years not only protect American interests, but to open up avenues of growth for our business and our workers, and frankly, to help open up world growth.  The world trading system is a mess.  It is broken down.  Insofar as fairness and reciprocity and, ultimately, free trade, I think this is contributing to our economic growth and our confidence.
A key point here on the economy is small-business confidence, record high or nearly so.  Consumer sentiment, I guess best in 15 or 20 years at least.  And of course, the job numbers have been superb.  A recent article in The New York Times suggested nothing better could be written about the job performance.  I loved reading that.  And unemployment rates are down across the board.  Really, we haven’t seen such low unemployment in many, many decades for all categories, I might add.
So I think the policies are working, and my great hope is that our friends at the G7 will take notice of these policies and work with us to extend and expand them so we can have a prosperous U.S. and world economy.  So these will all come up at Charlevoix.
Yes, ma’am.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-nec-director-larry-kudlow-g7-summit-060618/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I’m bringing out the big guns today. Since President Trump took office, the economy has created nearly 3 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, matching the lowest level in nearly 50 years.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today that job openings hit a record high of 6.7 million in April, meaning job openings outnumbered those that are unemployed.
American workers looking for new opportunities are finding them because of this President’s policies of lower taxes, deregulation, and fair and reciprocal trade. America’s economic potential has been unleashed.
I’ve invited the Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, to join us today and offer more details about the growing economy and take your questions on this topic. After that, I’ll be happy to come up and take questions on news of the day.
Thanks. Kevin.
MR. HASSETT: Thank you, Sarah. And I watch these things a lot, and I was noticing that not everybody is always in the best mood. And so I told Sarah what you guys need are some charts. Right?

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Today we are marking President Donald Trump’s 500th day in office and his unprecedented success on behalf of all Americans at home and abroad.
Since taking office, the President has strengthened American leadership, security, prosperity, and accountability.  And as we saw from Friday’s jobs report, our economy is stronger, Americans are optimistic, and business is booming.
When the President predicted 3 percent economic growth, a number of economists didn’t take him seriously, including President Obama’s Director of the National Economic Council and Moody’s chief economist.
The economy has now grown by 2.8 percent during the first four full quarters of this administration.  And we believe we are well on our way to reaching the level of growth the President has predicted.
The American people do not believe this strong economy is fantasy or unrealistic.  Just as he promised, President Trump believes in the American people and is putting them first in every decision.
On North Korea, we are actively preparing for the June 12 summit between the President and the North Korean leader.  The advance team in Singapore is finalizing logistical preparations and will remain in place until the summit begins.
In the DMZ, the U.S. Ambassador’s delegation continues diplomatic negotiations with the North Korean delegation.  Discussions have been very positive, and significant progress has been made.
Lastly, and most importantly — and speaking of great accomplishments — today is my husband’s birthday.  So Happy Birthday, Bryan, and for putting up with me for all of this time.
And with that, I will take your questions.  Jonathan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-060418/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  A short time ago, President Trump signed into law the Right to Try Act.  As you will recall, Right to Try is a major priority for the President.  He called on Congress to pass it in his State of the Union Address.
Right to Try gives the over 1 million Americans who die from a terminal illness every year a new tool to fight and make potentially lifesaving decisions about their treatment right here at home.
With the President’s signature, the federal government joins with 40 states that have taken the innovative approach and approved the right of terminally ill patients to try potentially lifesaving drugs.
A note about tomorrow’s schedule and the President’s trip to Texas: While in Houston, he will meet with families of the victims from the tragic school shooting at Santa Fe High School to personally offer his condolences and support.
Shortly, the President will host the White House Sports and Fitness Day with a number of activities on the South Lawn, including flag football, baseball, volleyball, golf, soccer, and track.
The administration is committed to highlighting the benefits of youth sports and reversing declining participation rates through the development of a national strategy.
As the mom of three preschoolers, I support them burning as much energy as possible, and I think sports is a great way to do that.

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you know, the President has just concluded a productive meeting with South Korean President Moon.  This is the sixth visit between them.
The two leaders had significant conversations on important issues, including the scheduled U.S.-North Korea summit.  Both leaders are committed to working together to accomplish the common goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
As you also know, it’s commencement season.  And the President and First Lady would like to extend a special congratulations to World War II veteran Bob Barger.
Sixty-eight years since he last sat in a classroom, Bob graduated from the University of Toledo this month after a review of his transcripts from the late 1940s showed he completed enough courses to qualify for an associate’s degree.
As the President said in his letter to Bob, his hard work, diligence, and passion to learn exemplify the Greatest Generation’s commitment to excellence and the American spirit.
As you know, the President took a number of questions earlier, so we’ll keep this short today.  And with that, I’ll get started.

1:25 P.M. EDT
SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you all know, President Trump is deeply committed to our veterans.  These brave men and women have given so much to our country and deserve our absolute best, which is why this President is fighting for reform and accountability at the VA.
In keeping with his campaign pledge, the President donates his salary on a quarterly basis to further important projects.  Today, the President is proud to donate his 2018 first-quarter salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs to support their caregiver programs.
Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie is here to accept the check.  I’d like to bring him up to say a few words about how these funds will be used.
And make sure that I give you —
ACTING SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you very much, Sarah.
SANDERS:  — the all-important actual check.
ACTING SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you very much, Sarah.  And good afternoon.
Before I address the President’s generosity, I want to say a couple of things about what happened in the House yesterday.  I want to send my thanks and the thanks of Veterans Affairs to the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Dr. Roe, and thank him for the bipartisan coalition that he forged together.  The vote yesterday was overwhelming, 347 to 70.
And this is long-awaited legislation that our veterans have been waiting in anticipation of.  This takes seven community care programs that we have been using for the last 15 to 20 years and condenses them into one.  It also makes it much easier for our veterans to obtain care that they need at the moment that they need it, in homes and in facilities closest to where they live.
This also opens up the Caregiver Program to long-waiting communities within our veterans’ world — those veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War who have not had access to a community caregiver program that was opened up for those who have served in the military since 9/11.
So with this strong bipartisan support, we urge the Senate to take up the House bill and give it to President Trump, hopefully before Memorial Day.
But I also want to single out the major veteran service organizations.  Thirty-eight of them signed a letter in support of this legislation to the House and Senate leadership.  Their people have been walking the halls of the Congress for the last week.  They will be in the Senate next week, and we can’t thank them enough for their support for our nation’s 20 million veterans.
And Sarah, I want to thank you for the announcement.  I want to thank you for President Trump’s generosity.  The President’s gift underscores his promise to do all that he can for veterans, which includes supporting those who care for our veterans — not just those of us at VA, but the husbands, the wives, the families, and the community caregivers who are out there day in and day out making life easier for those who have borne the battle.
President Trump understands the critical role of caregivers in meeting the essential needs of America’s veterans.
So we have already earmarked this gift for caregiver support in the form of mental health and peer support programs, financial aid, education training, and research.
I am deeply grateful to President Trump for providing me the opportunity to serve America’s veterans and for his generosity in supporting them.
So thank you, Sarah, and thank you to President Trump.  I know how much this means to American’s veterans.  Thank you.
SANDERS:  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Lastly, this week is set aside each year to honor those across our country who wear the badge.  In the spirit of Police Week, I want to read a quick letter from Samuel of San Antonio, Texas that he sent the President:
“Dear Mr. President Donald J. Trump,
Last year, I raised about $375 for our police.  I went down to McDonald’s and bought 75 $5 gift cards so the police officers could get coffee or lunch.  It would be really cool to meet you.  I wish I could vote for you, but I’m only 11.  But my mom voted for you.  I’m starting a fundraiser called, “A Break for the Blue.”  I listen to your talks, and I went to the inauguration and saw you.  You’re awesome.
Sincerely, Samuel”
Thankfully, I had the honor of meeting Samuel earlier today.  He was adopted by his family in Guatemala.  He is incredibly grateful to be an American, and he’s very grateful to all of the law enforcement officers around the country.
The President is very proud of Samuel and believes our country needs more young people like him who give back to their communities.  And he’s a really, really great kid and it was great to meet him.
And with that, I will take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-acting-secretary-veterans-affairs-robert-wilkie-05172018/

MR. SHAH:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Seventy years ago today, President Harry Truman recognized Israel as an independent country.  Today, the United States officially opened our embassy in the capital of Jerusalem.
After decades of past Presidents promising to move the embassy, only to fail to follow through, President Trump has fulfilled his promise to support one of America’s strongest allies.
As you all saw, to celebrate the opening, the Trump administration sent a high-level delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.  The delegation included Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump, and Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt.
Today is a great day for Israel and the United States, and a reminder to everyone that when President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.
I’m also announcing today that next Tuesday, May 22nd, the President will address the Susan B. Anthony List’s 11th annual Campaign for Life gala at the National Building Museum, where he will discuss the many actions he has taken to protect the lives of the unborn and defend religious liberty.
This morning, the President had a call with James Shaw Jr. to commend his heroic actions and quick thinking last month at a Waffle House in Tennessee.  Mr. Shaw saved lives when he wrestled a gun from an active shooter who had opened fire.
Lastly, over the weekend, we sadly saw another terrorist attack in central Paris.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.  We stand in solidarity with the French people and their government against this vicious act of terrorism, and pledge any assistance needed.
With that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-raj-shah-051418/

2:58 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President just finished rolling out new actions and proposals to drive down prescription drug prices for all Americans.  The current situation is unacceptable, and fixing high drug prices is a top priority for the President.
The blueprint will seek to encourage innovation, while also promoting better competition and reform.  The Department of Health and Human Services will take a range of immediate actions to implement the President’s plan.
I’d like to welcome Secretary Alex Azar to the podium to speak about this and take a few questions on this topic.  And as always, I’ll be back up to take questions on other news of the day.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Sarah.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Well, as the President said earlier, we need a system for prescription drug prices that puts American patients first, and one that takes care of America’s patients and doesn’t take advantage of them.
What I wanted to do was try to just put a frame together for the actions that you’ll see in the blueprint and what the President and I talked about today so you just have a sense where we’re going here.
There are four major problems that we face.  The first is high list prices for drugs.  The second is government rules that get in the way of plans getting good deals for our senior citizens in our Medicare program.  The third is foreign countries freeriding off of American innovation.  And the fourth is high out-of-pocket costs, especially for our seniors.
So as you heard from the President today, this administration has already made a lot of progress in this regard.  So in the first year and a half in office, the FDA has approved more generic drugs than ever before in history, saving $8.8 billion in the first year.  We also changed Medicare’s reimbursement rules to bring down the out-of-pocket spending for senior citizens, saving them $320 million out of pocket on the drugs that they buy each year.
That work, and the work that we’re laying out now in the President’s blueprint, it’s focused on four strategies to help fix this very complex problem that we face.  First, increase competition.  Second, increased and better negotiation.  Third, incentives to actually lower list prices.  And fourth, lowering out-of-pocket costs.
So first, it’s crucial that we have more competition in the prescription drug markets.  That means we need a vital and vibrant generic drug industry and generic drug market.  We need to foster and nurture a new, competitive biosimilar generic drug market.  Those are the generics, essentially, for those really complex, expensive biologic medicines.  We need to foster and nurture that.
We also have to get after pharma companies who engage in anticompetitive practices and try to block the entry of generics or biosimilar products to market by, for instance, blocking access to their products so they can’t do the studies they need to do in order to get approval of an affordable generic or biosimilar market.  So we’re going to go after all of these kinds of abuses.
Second, we’ve got to bring more private sector negotiation and better tools to our Medicare program so we get the best deals.  The Part D Drug Discount Program for senior citizens is now 15 years old.  I was there when we created it and helped to launch it.  And when we did it, it was — it’s still a great program, but it had the best tools, it was the best at negotiating great deals for our senior citizens, and really was able to drive tight formularies that were very efficient.  And that’s what’s helped keep the cost of that Part D drug plan down below forecast and constantly low premiums throughout its time.
But over 15 years, as so often happens with government programs, it got frozen in place.  And the private sector kept adapting and learning, especially after the economic crisis in 2007, how to control drug spend even better.  Okay?  Part D stayed more static.  We need now to bring the same tools that are available to the private sector to those Part D drug plans so they can negotiate better.  We need to unleash them so they can drive great deals for our seniors.
We also have another part of our program, a major part, which is called Part B.  These are the drugs the physician administers.  I mentioned those in the Rose Garden.  These right now are paid, basically, on a list price plus a markup.  They send us a bill; we write a check.  There’s no negotiation involved in that at all.
And the President has proposed in his budget, and we are reemphasizing, we’ve got to figure out ways to move those drugs, especially the high-cost ones, into the private Part D drug plan negotiations so that we can get a deal and start getting bargains on that for our seniors and for taxpayers.  We need to look at other mechanisms — and you’ll see that in the blueprint, some other ones — that also help us negotiate better deals there for those plans.
Third, and this is a very complex area right now, we have to bring incentives to lower list drug prices.  Okay?  Right now, every incentive in the system is to increase and have high list drug prices.  Because everybody in the system, except the patient and the taxpayer, is wetting their beak along the way.  They’re getting a percent of that list price.  List price goes up, list price higher, everybody makes more money along the way.  So it’s just — the math just works that way.  We need to try to flip the incentives backwards so that financially it makes less sense to increase prices.
So one of the things we’re going to do — I talked about this in the Rose Garden — is that we are having the FDA look at how we can require in direct-to-consumer TV ads that you have to disclose the list price of your drug.  We believe it’s an important part of fair balance that if you’re telling a patient, activating a patient to have a discussion with their doctor about a drug, telling them all the good things that drug can do for them, it’s material and relevant to know if it’s a $50,000-drug or a $100-drug, because often that patient is going to have to bear a lot of that cost.
In addition, we have, in Medicaid and Medicare, some key incentives that we can turn around on list prices.  As part of Obamacare, one of the deals with the pharma industry was capping the statutory rebates on drugs in the Medicaid program at 100 percent.  We’re going to work with Congress to look at overturning that cap on rebates.  That, again, will make the math work so that when you increase your list price, it’s going to cost you more money if you’re a pharma executive thinking about raising prices.
We’re also proposing — we want to think about some really creative ideas in our programs of reversing those incentives.  So, right now, in our drug discount program, if you have a drug that fits into one of these protected classes, it’s almost impossible for the drug plan to negotiate and get any kind of discount from you.  Well, everybody gets that.  What if instead we say, you only get to be in that protected class if you haven’t raised your list price in the previous 18 months?  What if we say, you can be exempt from these specialty tiers where the patient has to pay a lot out of pocket, but only if you haven’t increased your list price in the previous months?  So a lot of tools like that.
The other big area we have to look at is the entire system of rebates that we have with pharmacy benefit managers.  We are calling into question, today, the entire structure of using rebates as the method of negotiating discounts in the pharmacy channel.  Because, right now, every incentive is for the drug company to have a very high list price and to negotiate rebates down, often in a very non-transparent way.  What if instead we said, no rebates; flat price; fixed price in the contracts; take away this whole, what’s called the gross-to-net spread that removes that and makes people indifferent to what the list price is in that system and takes away the incentives where even the pharmacy benefit manager makes money from higher list prices.
We also have a real issue that we’ve got to look at, which is the role of compensation for pharmacy benefit managers.  They’re taking it now from both sides.  They’re getting compensated by their customers — the insurance companies — but they’re also getting compensated by the drug companies they’re supposed to be negotiating against.  They’re getting rebates and keeping some of the rebates.  They’re getting administrative fees.  Should we move to a fiduciary model where the pharmacy benefit manager works for the insurance company or the individual, and only is compensated by the insurance company or individual?  Forbid remuneration from the pharmaceutical company so that it’s all completely on one side there, complete alignment of interest.
And then, finally, how do we lower out-of-pocket drug costs?  Well, as the President talked about, we’re going to get rid of these gag rules.  Right now, some pharmacy benefit managers are telling pharmacists, “You’re not allowed to tell the patient that if they paid cash for this generic drug, it would be cheaper for you than if you run it through your insurance.”  We think that’s unconscionable.  And in Part D, we’re going to work to block that.
We also think it’s a right that when you’re sitting there with your doctor, you ought to be able to know what your out of pocket is for a drug you’re going to be prescribed under your precise drug plan, and you ought to have that information, and you ought to have information on what competing drugs are that your doctor is not prescribing, and what you would pay out of pocket for that.  And that ought to be across the Part B Plan and the Part D Plan.
Let me give you an example.  If you’re in with a doctor — this doctor has an infusion clinic as part of their office.  So they write you a drug that might be an infused drug.  You might have a $300 copay for that.  Well, wouldn’t you like to know that if the doctor instead wrote you a self-injectable drug, you’d have a $20 copay?  And you could at least have an informed discussion.  So we think that kind of informed consumer on out of pocket will also help drive real savings in the system.
So these are just some of the measures.  There are over 50 actions that we have in the blueprint.  And this, again, not one and done.  We are learning, we are open, we’re hearing.  We want this to be an active, ongoing process.  This doesn’t get solved tomorrow.  It’s going to take years of restructuring the system.  But these are big, they are bold steps.  This is the most comprehensive attack on prescription drug affordability in history, by any President.  And I’m just grateful President Trump is standing behind us and encouraging us to do these kind of bold measures.

AMBASSADOR BOLTON:  Well, I don’t really have much to add to the President’s speech.  I think the decision is very clear.  I think it’s a firm statement of American resolve to prevent not only Iran from getting nuclear weapons, but a ballistic missile delivery capability.  It limits its continuing support of terrorism and its causing instability and turmoil in the Middle East.
And I think the President also laid out what comes next.  As he said at the end, he’s prepared to look at discussions on a much broader resolution of the malign behavior that we see from Iran.  And we’ve been in discussions already with our allies on that.  We’ll be continuing it beginning, literally, early tomorrow morning.
So I’ll just stop there.  I’m happy to answer any questions.  Kevin.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-national-security-advisor-john-bolton-iran/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon.  With labor participation, wages, and job growth all on the rise, we are seeing firsthand how President Trump’s economic policies are benefitting American workers.
The unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent, the lowest level since the year 2000.  The unemployment rate for adult women is at 3.5 percent.  And the African American unemployment rate is at 6.6 percent –- the lowest ever recorded.  And the unemployment rate for Hispanics tied a series low.
Since the President’s election, more than 3 million jobs have been created.  The President’s historic tax cuts, deregulation, and pro-growth policies are creating jobs and restoring confidence in America’s economy.
On another important matter, the White House has been in close contact with state and local officials in Hawaii since the initial earthquake and volcanic eruption.  The President continues to monitor the ongoing situation.
FEMA and the White House encourage all individuals in potentially affected areas to monitor local radio or TV stations for updated emergency information, and follow the instructions of state and local officials.
The New York Post said today that CIA Acting Director Gina Haspel has headed four CIA stations across the globe; been a senior official in the CIA’s Russia operation; held several top roles in the division responsible for covert operations; and post-9/11, was a senior-level supervisor in counterterrorism.
The Post further noted that her integrity and, significantly, her political impartiality are unchallenged.  She deserves quick confirmation without partisan theatrics.
The bottom line: Acting Director Haspel has an unparalleled understanding of the CIA and is the right person to lead it during these dangerous times.
Lastly, and on a slightly lighter note, I would like to congratulate Katherine and Alex –- two members of the White House press corps –- on their engagement over the weekend.  So congratulations.
And with that — I don’t know if they even showed up today but that’s okay.  (Laughter.)","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-050718/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Today in the Rose Garden, President Trump continued the tradition of celebrating the National Day of Prayer.  The President also signed an executive order to ensure that all faith-based communities have strong advocates throughout his administration.  The President encourages people of all faiths across the country to join together and pray for our nation.
In that same light, President Trump extends his thoughts and prayers to the nine victims and their families of yesterday’s military plane crash in Savannah, Georgia.  The nine members of the Puerto Rico National Guard, who had a combined 167 years of service, were on an official mission.  The President has been briefed on the incident, and will work with the Department of Defense to provide assistance and resources to the Puerto Rico National Guard.
As you all know, President Trump’s nominee to lead the CIA, Gina Haspel, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week.
In her 33 years at the agency, Acting Director Haspel has held senior positions around the globe, overseeing covert operations and counterterrorism efforts to protect the homeland.
She’s one of the most qualified, most capable individuals ever nominated to lead the CIA.  We are seeing widespread support from across the political spectrum and within the intelligence community.  People that worked at the CIA, people that led the CIA, support Acting Director Haspel.
Jeremy Bash, the former Democratic chief counsel to the House Committee on Intelligence and chief of staff at the CIA under President Obama, called Acting Director Haspel “the rare CIA director nominee that both parties should love.”
With planning and preparations underway for the summit with North Korea, and with Secretary Pompeo now engaged from the State Department, Republicans and Democrats should come together and confirm Gina Haspel as the Director of the CIA.
Today, we also mark World Press Freedom Day.  This comes after a recent suicide bombing in Afghanistan claiming the lives of at least 10 journalists.  Many journalists around the globe do their jobs at great risk every day.  The United States stands in solidarity with these men and women who work for free and open societies.
And with that, I will take your questions.  Zeke.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-050318/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Today, President Trump welcomed the heroic crew and passengers of Southwest Flight 1380 to the White House.  While in route from New York to Dallas last month, an engine failure crippled the aircraft.  Because of Captain Tammie Jo Shults, one of the first women ever to fly tactical fighter aircraft in the United States Navy, First Officer Darren Ellisor, and the three crewmembers, the plane was able to land safely in Philadelphia.
We continue to pray for the family of Jennifer Riordan who tragically passed away due to injuries she sustained.  The President thanks all of these men and women for their bravery.
Lastly, we strongly condemn yesterday’s suicide bombing in Kabul.  More than 35 people were killed, including at least 10 journalists.  These journalists were in the area to cover a bomb blast when a second explosion occurred.  Afghanistan’s press corps is a powerful illustration of how that country has transformed.  There’s absolutely no justification for such a senseless and heinous act.
And with that, I will take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-050118/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The first state visit for the Trump administration was a tremendous success, and the First Lady, in particular, deserves a lot of the credit.  Her attention to every detail and full engagement in the planning helped highlight and showcase the special relationship between the United States and France, our oldest ally.
President Trump and President Macron also had a number of important conversations on critical issues facing each nation at home and abroad.  As the President said yesterday, the future between the United States and France has never looked brighter.
Tomorrow, the administration will be participating in the 25th anniversary of Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day.  The President looks forward to welcoming many of your children and the children of those who work here at the White House.
As a reminder, this Saturday is National Prescription Take Back Day.  Across the country, many businesses, medical offices, state, local, and tribal governments, and first responders will host drop-off events where Americans can safely dispose of unused medication.  Disposing of unused pills can prevent the misuse of commonly prescribed opioids.
During the last National Take Back Day in October, Americans disposed of a record-breaking 900,000 pounds of prescription pills.
The Trump administration encourages everyone to take part.  We can all be part of the solution.  For more details on that, I encourage you to visit TakeBackDay.dea.gov to find your local collection site and learn more about how to safely dispose of prescription medication.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-042518/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Welcome back.  Today, the President and First Lady welcome President Emmanuel Macron and Mrs. Macron to the White House, beginning the first state visit for the Trump administration.  This visit will celebrate the long and enduring friendship between France and the U.S.  Discussions will include economic, diplomatic, and global issues.
The First Lady has taken an active role in every detail and planning of the visit, including the state dinner, which will be held tomorrow evening.  And we’re looking forward to a very successful state visit.
As you all saw, we now have three Democrat senators who have announced they will vote to confirm Mike Pompeo, President Trump’s highly qualified nominee for Secretary of State.  However, a majority of Democrats continue their pointless obstruction to score cheap political points with their base as a willful attempt to undermine American diplomacy.
Regardless, the President is looking forward to Mike Pompeo’s confirmation so he can continue doing an incredible job on behalf of the American people.
I also want to commend the heroic actions of James Shaw Jr. early Sunday morning at a Waffle House in Tennessee.  Mr. Shaw saved lives when he wrestled a gun from an active shooter who had opened fire.  The President offers his condolences to the victims and their families.  He is monitoring the ongoing situation and the White House is in regular contact with state and local officials.

3:34 P.M. EDT
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you all for coming on a Friday.  Today’s background briefing is on the subject of the state visit of President of France Macron.  We’re excited to be welcoming him and the First Lady to the United States.
And today’s background briefing, for your situational awareness and not for reporting, your briefer is [senior administration official].  For attribution purposes, you may refer to him as senior administration official.
Today’s call is embargoed until the conclusion of this briefing.  And my colleague will run you through the schedule and lay out some broad themes that you may wish to consider as you cover this visit.  Thank you.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay.  Thank you again.  Good afternoon again, ladies and gentlemen.
Next week, President Trump and the First Lady will host the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, and Mrs. Macron for the first state visit of the Trump administration.
The state visit will include, on Monday, April 23rd, a tour of Mt. Vernon and a private couples dinner.  President Trump is eager to host the Macrons for this special event as he remembers, fondly, the dinner the couples shared together in the Eiffel Tower on the eve of Bastille Day that was last July in 2017.
On Tuesday, April 24th, President Macron will meet with President Trump in the White House, midmorning, for a one-on-one session in the Oval Office.  That will be followed by an expanded working bilateral meeting with the French and U.S. delegations.  The bilateral meeting will include the Vice President, the Acting Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the White House Chief of Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and Ambassador Jamie McCourt, who is our ambassador in Paris.
The members of the French delegation include France’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Economics and Finance, the Minister of Defense, and National Security Advisor, among others.  Please contact the government of France for the latest details on the composition of its delegation.
There will also be a joint press conference on that day.  There will be a State Department luncheon, which will also include the Vice President, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, and that evening, a state dinner here in the White House.
On Wednesday, April 25th, President Macron will address a Joint Session of Congress.  The address will mark the anniversary of the day that French General Charles de Gaulle addressed the Joint Session of Congress, specifically April 25th, 1960.
I would like to stress three themes for this visit.  First, the United States and France enjoy a long and enduring friendship.  This visit will celebrate the close and continuing ties between France and the United States in this, the 100th anniversary year of the end of World War I.  President Trump is continuing the legacy of French-American cooperation that stretches back to America’s independence, and is working with President Macron to build upon the already strong ties between the United States and France.
Second, France is a valued trade and investment partner.  France was the United States’ first trade partner.  And France remains a major destination for U.S. exports and a source of foreign investment in the United States.
Today, France is the United States’ third largest trading partner in Europe, and averages over $1 billion in commercial transactions every day.  The United States is the top destination for French foreign investment.  And in 2016, France invested $19.3 billion in the United States.  The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in France, and in 2016, we invested some $78 billion there.  In 2016, French investment supported a bit over 26,000 jobs in the United States.
Three, France is a strong and reliable ally.  The United States works closely with France to combat terror around the world.  And President Trump and President Macron will discuss recent joint operations in Syria in response to the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons on April 7th; broader issues relating to Syria and the Middle East — these would include Iran’s malign influence in the region; and also France’s leading role in NATO and in global counterterrorism operations more generally, including in the Sahel, where France takes the leading role.
So with that, I’ll be happy, at this time, to field questions of a general nature about the visit.  Thank you.
I was hoping I’d get to say, “If there are no questions, thank you very much.”  (Laughter.)  Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/background-press-briefing-upcoming-state-visit-president-macron-france-042318/

West Palm Beach, Florida
12:20 P.M. EDT
MR. KUDLOW:  I’ll just say to start, before we take some questions, this is a very important meeting.  A lot of really key issues are on the line.  You obviously know about the foreign policy side regarding North Korea, which is a major, major issue for Japan and for the United States.
On the economic and trade side, there will also be very important issues.  Japan is a great friend and ally.  We have certain disagreements with respect to some of the trading issues.  We’ll iron those out, hopefully.
Mr. Abe is a friend of President Trump’s, and I think the general setting is going to be very positive.  There are some bilateral issues.  In fact, the United States would probably like to see a free trade agreement come out at some point with Japan.
And the rest of it is — I believe stocks are up 260 points.  Yesterday was Tax Day.  No, today is Tax Day.  Lower taxes.  Strong economic growth.  Nobody believes that, except me.  I’m hanging in there.  We’re in the early stages of an economic boom here in the United States.  And actually, Japan’s economy has improved quite a bit.
So instead of babble on, let me just stand up and take some questions.  We have a team of experts that will try to help you out.

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Today, I had the opportunity to visit the National Safety Council’s Opioid Memorial on the Ellipse. It’s a moving experience. President Trump and the First Lady encourage you all to visit the memorial before it leaves Washington, D.C. on April 18th.
Today at the Summit of Americas in Lima, Peru, Assistant to the President and Advisor Ivanka Trump, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Acting U.S. Secretary of State announced OPIC’s 2X Americas Latin American women’s initiative — say that fast — which will mobilize $500 million in private capital to invest in projects that empower women in Latin America. This new initiative will help break down barriers that limit women’s full participation in the economy and reaffirms the Trump administration’s commitment to empowering women in Latin America and around the globe.
As you all saw, yesterday’s confirmation hearing for Secretary of State-designee Mike Pompeo went very well. From his years in the Army, to his time as a key member of the House Intelligence Committee, to his successful tenure as CIA Director, Secretary-designee Pompeo has excelled as one of the nation’s key leaders in national security and foreign policy. As a result of Mike Pompeo’s leadership, America has been safer, more secure, and more prosperous.
There is absolutely no legitimate reason that Secretary-designee Pompeo’s confirmation process should not be done in a speedy and bipartisan manner. Even the Washington Post editorial board — hardly a cheerleader for this administration — published an editorial yesterday with a simple, straight-to-the-point headline: “Confirm Mike Pompeo.”
Democrats and Republicans should do exactly that by coming together and doing what is, without question, the right thing for our country.
And with that, I will take your questions. Cecilia.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-041318/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Earlier today, the President signed a bipartisan, anti-sex trafficking bill that provides law enforcement officials, including state attorneys general and local prosecutors, invaluable tools.  The new law makes it clearer to take legal action against websites promoting advertisements for this modern-day slavery.  Human trafficking is one of the most barbaric types of exploitation, and President Trump has been clear that it has no place in our world.
Advocates have long pointed to these websites as profiting from trafficking, including of children.  It also provides new legal recourses for victims and law enforcement by enhancing penalties for people who promote or facilitate prostitution.
Yesterday, the President signed an Executive Order on Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility.  The order provides nine principles of economic mobility that will guide agencies that administer public assistance programs to review all regulations relating to work and send a report to the President on what they can do to get Americans back to work.
The Trump administration recognizes that many states have been successful enacting commonsense work requirements and are seeing positive results, improving the lives of thousands of individuals and families.  Many others have noticed and are leading the charge to provide greater opportunities to their citizens.
President Trump believes we can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.
We are also glad to see California Governor Jerry Brown work with the administration and send members of the National Guard to help secure the southern border.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-041118/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you know, the President welcomed the Emir of Qatar to the White House today.  The two leaders discussed the strategic relationship and our cooperation on a wide range of security and economic issues.  This includes efforts to bolster their military capabilities and to advance new commercial deals that would create tens of thousands of American jobs.
The Emir reiterated his commitment to counter terrorist financing and violent extremism.  As you may recall, just a few weeks ago, Qatar publicly designated 20 terrorist financiers and 6 entities.  This is the latest in a series of important steps, but the President and Emir agreed that there is more progress to be made.  We are committed to partnering in that effort.
Finally, the two leaders discussed the urgent need to resolve the Gulf dispute.  The United States must be able to work jointly with a united Gulf Cooperation Council to promote regional security and stability, and to stand against Iran’s dangerous activities.
Also, as you may have seen, the President spoke this morning with British Prime Minister Theresa May.  Both leaders condemned Syrian President Assad’s vicious disregard for human life and agreed not to allow the use of chemical weapons to continue.
To that end, the President will not attend the Summit of the Americas or travel to Colombia, as originally scheduled.
The Vice President will travel to the summit in his place and will meet with the Colombian President while he’s there in Peru.  President Trump will remain in the United States to oversee the American response to Syria and to monitor developments around the world.
Looking ahead to this afternoon, the President is pleased to welcome the University of Alabama Crimson Tide football team to the White House, in celebration of their 17th National Championship.  Pretty sure that was written by somebody from Alabama.  (Laughter.)
Coach Saban, UA President Bell, and the team captains will meet with President Trump in the Oval Office, and the group will then join the rest of the team and hundreds of Tide fans out on the South Lawn.  And that event will, of course, be open to the press.
And with that, I will take your questions.  And because it is her birthday — Nadia, I’m going to go with you.  And happy birthday.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-041018/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you all saw, the President led a Cabinet meeting this morning, with the opioid crisis being a major part of the agenda.
In recent weeks, we have continued combatting this issue on all fronts.  And by making the opioid crisis the primary focus of today’s Cabinet meeting, the President is once again showing that it’s one of his top priorities.
There’s a long road ahead and much work to be done.  But we will not rest until our streets are safe, our families are secure, and the victims of this terrible epidemic are able to live a life free of addiction.
As the President noted yesterday, and again today during the Cabinet meeting, the chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime against innocent civilians is horrifying.  The images, especially of suffering children, have shocked the conscience of the entire civilized world.
Sadly, these actions are consistent with Assad’s established pattern of chemical weapons use.  His forces are already responsible for previous chemical weapons attacks and other actions targeting civilians.
The President has noted that Russia and Iran also bear responsibility for these acts, since they would not be possible without their material support.  It is also now clear that Russia has betrayed its obligations to guarantee the end of the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons program.
The President and his national security team are consulting closely with allies and partners to determine the appropriate response.  As President Trump clearly stated, there will be a price to pay.
We call on all members of the international community to share any information related to this attack and to hold the perpetrators and their sponsors accountable.
And we call upon the Syrian regime and Russia to open the area to international medical assistance and international monitoring.

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Happy Friday.
As you all saw this morning, the administration has sanctioned 7 Russian oligarchs, 12 companies, and 17 top government officials and allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Today’s sanctions and the totality of the administration’s actions, which are in keeping with Congress’s wishes, prove the President is absolutely correct when he says no one has been tougher on Russia. We want a positive relationship with the Russian government, but for this to happen, there must be a significant change in their behavior.
As we announced in February, the President and the First Lady are looking forward to welcoming President and Mrs. Macron of France for a state visit later this month.
Today, I can also add the detail that on the first night of their visit, the President and the First Lady, along with President and Mrs. Macron, will enjoy a private dinner at Mt. Vernon, the historic home of our nation’s first President, George Washington. This setting will serve as a beautiful reminder of France’s unique status as America’s very first ally, going all the way back to the Revolution.
Finally, this is General McMaster’s last day serving as National Security Advisor here in the White House.
General McMaster is a terrific person. On a personal note, it has been a real privilege to serve alongside him and to travel around the world advancing the President’s America First foreign policy. His decades-long career in service of his nation is an inspiration to us all, and we know he will do well wherever he lands next.
The President wishes him well; he will miss working with him. But they will continue to be great friends, and will no doubt be seeing a lot of each other in the years ahead.
And with that, I will take your questions. Major.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-040618/

3:12 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Apologies for the delay.
Today, we solemnly remember the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was viciously gunned down in Memphis 50 years ago this evening.
In what would prove to be the final public speech of his incredible life, Dr. King said:
“Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And [so] I’m so happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.”
These prophetic words were from a man who found his identity and his purpose through his faith, and selflessly led a movement that, while it cost him his life, changed the course of history.
In honor of his sacrifice, we continue to perfect our Union by defending the truth of all our country’s founding principle that all men are created equal.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, the President will be traveling to West Virginia. While there, he will participate in a roundtable with CEOs and workers from companies who have provided bonuses, pay raises, and other benefits to their employees as a result of the Trump tax cuts.
Also participating in the roundtable will be families who have more money in their pockets as a result of this new law, which passed without a single Democrat vote.
This will be the President’s fourth trip to West Virginia since he took office.
Later this month, the President will welcome the decorated U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams to the White House. This event will take place on April 27th. The President looks forward to celebrating these incredible athletes and their remarkable achievements in the 2018 Winter Games.
Before taking your questions today, I have a special guest here with us, Secretary Nielsen from the Department of Homeland Security.
As you all know, the President received a briefing yesterday on the administration’s strategy to confront the growing threat of illegal immigration, drugs, and violent gang members coming across our southern border.
As the President said, the mobilization of the National Guard will be an important part of the strategy. Secretary Nielsen will come up now to deliver brief remarks, then take your questions.
And after that, I’ll be back up to answer questions of the day and other topics. With that, Secretary.
SECRETARY NIELSEN: Well, good afternoon, everyone. I want to start — I’m going to give you some facts and perspective. Hopefully, I can put some things in context.
But I want to start with just a very simple statement for today’s announcement, which is: Border security is homeland security, which is national security. It’s not a partisan issue. It’s not something we can separate out. It’s core to being a sovereign nation.
The President has reiterated this many times. In fact, he has specifically said that a sovereign nation that cannot, or worse not, chooses not to defend its borders will soon cease, in fact, to be a sovereign nation.
The threat is real. We have talked about it over the last 18 months. The Department of Homeland Security, since its creation in 2003, has watched for current and emerging threats. Despite a number of steps that this administration has taken, which I’ll talk about shortly, we continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity, transnational criminal organizations, and illegal immigration flow across our border. This threatens not only the safety of our communities and children, but also our very rule of law on which, as you know, our country was founded. It’s time to act.
So let’s talk a little bit about that today. In an effort to prevent such a consequence, the President has directed that the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security work together with our governors to deploy the National Guard to our southwest border to assist the Border Patrol. The President will be signing a proclamation to that effect today.
When the President took office last year, he issued a series of executive orders and directives that empowered DHS, for the first time in almost a decade, to fully enforce our border security and immigration laws. At that time, we saw a precipitous drop in unlawful border crossings — 44 percent down in the first few months after his inauguration.
This “Trump effect,” as many of you have referred to it and we have as well, on illicit border activity was undeniable, as smugglers, transnational criminal organizations, and those who are responsible for illicit activity across our border were forced to wait and see if enhanced enforcement efforts would scale back their criminal activity for good.
In the last 15 months, under the President’s leadership, the administration has taken major steps to methodically strengthen border security. Let me just give you just a few, but we’re happy to provide additional details.
We stepped up the targeting of dangerous criminal gangs, such as MS-13. We removed thousands more criminal aliens than the year prior. We no longer exempt entire classes of illegal aliens from the consequences of breaking our immigration laws. We began the first new border wall system construction in close to a decade. We modified our asylum system processing to more quickly adjudicate claims. And we ended so-called “temporary immigration programs” that were either constitutionally dubious or were administered in a manner that was inconsistent with the purpose of the law or contrary to the intent of Congress.
Despite these actions, we’ve recently seen the numbers of illegal border crossings rise from 40-year lows last April, back to previous levels. Our current border security and immigration laws fail the American people. The system rewards bad behavior. It does not punish lawbreakers. It undermines our nation’s economic interest. Make no mistake, interdiction without the ability to promptly remove those without legitimate cause is not border security. It is not national security.
When the President took office, the traffickers, smugglers, TCOs, and the illegal aliens that serve as their currency paused to see what our border enforcement efforts would look like and if we could follow through on the deportation and removal. While we have been apprehending aliens at the border with historic efficiency, these illicit smuggling groups saw that our ability to actually remove those who come here illegally did not keep pace. They saw that there were loopholes they could exploit to avoid detention and removal. And let me give you some numbers to put how that has changed the context of our immigration and border security system.
Before 2013, approximately one out of every 100 arriving aliens claimed credible fear, which is the first step in United States asylum process. Today, more than one out of 10 do so. Why this matters is because this number unfortunately demonstrates and is indicative of the rising level of fraud that plagues our system. This prevents us from timely helping those who really do need asylum. When we have to deal with the fraud and the backlogs, we are unable to help those truly in need.
Before 2011, over 90 percent of arriving aliens were single adult males. Today, 40 percent are families and children. The traffickers and smugglers know that if you arrive with a family, under our current legal and court system, you have a much better chance of being released into the United States. We have seen the smugglers advertise this as an enticement, and we have seen traffickers unfortunately fraudulently use children to gain entry into our country.
Before 2009 — the last stat here — 90 percent of arriving aliens were Mexican nationals. Today, nearly 50 percent are from Central America. The traffickers and smugglers know that these individuals cannot, under U.S. law, be easily removed in an expeditious way back to their country of origin and so they exploit the loophole.
Each of these reflect the effects of legislative and legal loopholes that have made it that much more difficult to remove the bulk of those we apprehend, whether they are criminals, traffickers, gangs, or illegal aliens.
Those falsely claiming asylum know that if they use the magic words, “credible fear,” because of the low threshold that currently exists and because of the very large backlog, they will be released with work permits into the interior for many years before they see a judge.
In 2012, when DACA was offered, families with children similarly understood that deferred action was on the table, and the possibility of further future deferred action has caused additional migration that continues through today. This is exacerbated because of the deeply flawed Flores Settlement Agreement, one that we have talked about before. And because of our inability to use expedited removal authority for all unaccompanied alien children.
Because of this, we do see many more Central American families with children attempting to enter the country illegally, many more than a decade ago.
Smugglers themselves are gaming the system, pure and simple. They take advantage of the loopholes in our laws. They know that we cannot prosecute as we need to to stop their behavior. And we know, in some cases, it takes many years for them to be removed. This, in addition, creates a massive magnet for additional illegal immigration, TCO activity, and criminal activity across our border.
Every day, we rely on a number of partnerships to help us accomplish our mission to secure our borders. State and local officials, interagency federal partners, Congress, and of course, our international partners. I have been with, and will, and continue to work with these partners. This is a problem that requires all of our attention.
This administration has also asked Congress for help. Congress makes immigration law. It’s that simple. That is how our system works. Congress makes immigration law. Congress decides which classes of aliens are allowed into the country and which can be deported. We’ve asked for changes to existing law to close loopholes that exacerbate the challenges we have and often result in a de facto court order or resource constrained resulting catch-and-release.
The President, as you know, terminated administrative catch-and-release last year, but due to these loopholes, we often find, particularly of those with family, they must be released after 20 days.
We asked Congress for additional funds for the border wall system for detention beds, personnel, as that magnet of lawlessness still draws people by the thousands to our borders. Why not attempt the journey if you have no belief you’ll ever be caught? We must change the environment. We must change and reduce those pull factors.
Unfortunately, time and time again, Congress has failed to act. Worse still, some members of Congress have continually opposed efforts to secure the border. As a result of this continued congressional inaction, the administration has drafted legislation, and we will be asking Congress again to provide the legal authority and resources to address this crisis at our borders.
We will not allow illegal immigration levels to become the norm — more than a thousand people a day, 300,000 a year. Violating our sovereignty as a nation will never be acceptable to this President.
Since becoming Secretary, I’ve spoken with hundreds of members of Congress on the need for legislation. I will continue to speak with anyone who will listen about the need to end catch-and-release and close these loopholes once and for all.
Based on conversations with congressional leadership, I am optimistic. We are a country based on the rule of law. I ask Congress to pass needed legislation with all urgency. I will work with you. Let’s get this done.
In the meantime, the President has directed the National Guard personnel be deployed to the southern border. The Department of Defense, as you know, has long supported the efforts of DHS to protect our nation’s borders. This includes ongoing counternarcotic missions, infrastructure construction, persistent surveillance operations training, and aerial support throughout the Western Hemisphere. The Department of Defense is a longtime partner of the Department of Homeland Security, and I thank them for their support.
While plans are being finalized, it’s our expectation that the National Guard will deploy personnel in support of CBP’s border security mission. It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and we are moving quickly. We are anxious to have this support.
I have spoken with all of the governors, and will be continuing these conversations. It is very encouraging that some of them have already taken dramatic steps in their own states to confront illegal immigration and to strengthen that border security to prevent the criminal activity and the inflow of drugs. These are leaders who understand the importance of enforcement in border security and how it improves public safety in their states. I look forward to working with each of them.
As a result, I will not provide the full details today because much of what we will be doing in conjunction with the border state governors will be worked out through the appropriate processes, as it has been in the past.
The urgency cannot however be underscored. We will be doing this today under the President’s direction. I will be continuing my conversation with all four border governors. And we hope to have the path forward very much specified in the near future.
I also want to just make sure, before I turn it over for questions, to mention that we’ve been in touch with my counterparts in Mexico regarding this action. They understand the administration’s desire, much like their own, to control illegal entry into our country. They understand and respect our national sovereignty. I thank them for their recent support in addressing the yearly caravan, as well as in signing a number of security-related agreements last week. I value their partnership and do not expect this operation to affect that relationship.
I want to close by saying that the problems of catch-and-release and unsecured borders are solvable problems. Congress has the ability and the opportunity to provide this administration and our country with the tools it needs for border security. In my conversations with members of Congress, all have said they are for border security and the rule of law.
The vulnerabilities we need to address are well known. The legislative fixes have been drafted and debated. The tools are tested and ready. All that is lacking is the will to act. I’m hoping that changes, and I call on all members of Congress to work with us to close these loopholes and to end catch-and-release completely.
Let me be clear, we are a welcoming nation. We support tens of millions of legal visitors every year, as well as over 1 million legal immigrants. We will continue to do so. But as I said earlier, border security is national security. Security of our nation is not a partisan issue. Border security is national security.
It’s a foundational element to the very security of our systems, of our citizens, and our homeland. The President is committed to securing our border and using all the tools that he has available to him. I thank him for his leadership and support of DHS.
I thank you for listening, and I look forward to your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-and-department-of-homeland-security-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-040418/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Sorry to interrupt that live shot, Kristen.  (Laughs.)
As you’ve all seen this morning, the President secured a dramatically improved trade agreement with the Republic of Korea, continuing to fulfill one of his key campaign promises to the American people.
Since the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, commonly referred to as KORUS, went into effect in 2012, the U.S. trade deficit increased by 70 percent from $6.3 billion to $10.7 billion.  Through negotiations to improve KORUS, the U.S. Trade Representative has secured changes that will reduce the trade deficit and ensure that KORUS is a good deal for the prosperity and the security of the American people.
This is a big deal for the American automotive industry.  It’s a big deal for our parts manufacturers.  It’s a big deal for our pharmaceutical companies.  And ultimately, it’s a big deal and a major win for American workers and American businesses.
Continuing on the economic front, the fourth quarter GDP numbers were revised up, to 2.9 percent.  This reflected strong consumer spending at the end of the year, and increased investments from American businesses.
According to Market Watch, “Hiring is strong, unemployment is low, and recent tax cuts are putting more money in people’s pockets.  Accordingly, the U.S. is likely to grow even faster this year than it did in 2017.”
The Council of Economic Advisers released a report today on the economic benefits of expanded infrastructure investment, estimating that the President’s plan would deliver employment gains and increase GDP growth.
With that in mind, the President will be traveling tomorrow to Richfield, Ohio to deliver remarks on his infrastructure initiative before an audience of local workers.
The remarks will be at a training site for members of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 18 — a diversified trade union representing heavy-equipment operators, mechanics, and surveyors in the construction industry, and stationary engineers who work in operations and maintenance in building and industrial complexes.
Following on the success of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President’s successful economic agenda.
These workers represent the hardworking Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our nation’s infrastructure sparked from the President’s vision, and it will definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.
And with that, I will take your questions.  Cecilia.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-032818/

MR. SHAH: Good afternoon, everyone.  Let me start by saying that the United States is deeply saddened by the news of yesterday’s tragic fire at a shopping mall in Siberia.  The American people extend our deepest sympathies to the Russian people and the families of those who lost their lives and were injured in the fire.
Separately, as many of you saw, the President ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian intelligence officers, and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle.
This action is a response to Russia’s use of a military-grade chemical weapon in the United Kingdom, and was taken in conjunction with our allies and partners around the world, including more than a dozen countries in the EU and NATO, and others around the world.
Today’s actions make the United States safer by reducing Russia’s ability to spy on Americans and to conduct covert operations and threaten America’s national security.  With these steps, the U.S. and our allies and partners around the world make clear to Russia that actions have consequences.
We stand ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government’s behavior.
Looking ahead to next week, the President will welcome the leaders of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the White House on April 3rd.
President Trump and the three Baltic heads of state will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania’s independence and set the stage for another century of strong ties between our countries.
The U.S.-Baltic Summit will focus on how best to strengthen our security, business, trade, energy, and cultural partnerships.  The visit will also highlight Baltic States’ achievements since their independence, including their economic growth, recent success in meeting NATO’s defense and spending pledges.
A quick reminder for everyone here, the annual White House Easter Egg Roll will take place on the South Lawn a week from today.  We are inviting members of the White House Press Corps to bring your kids to the event.  So please work with the Press Office to secure tickets, if you haven’t already.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Happy Agriculture Day.  Today, we honor the men and women who work every day to feed, fuel, and clothe the people of the United States and the world.
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue hosted Vice President Pence at the Department of Agriculture to commemorate the day.  As you may remember, when the President spoke at the American Farm Bureau Convention earlier this year, he said, “Our farmers deserve a government that serves their interest and empowers them to do the hard work [that] they love to do so much.”
This administration is making sure government does that by reducing burdensome regulations, allowing them to be more productive; by cutting their taxes and empowering them to make their own decisions about investing in their operations; and by working to make sure our trade agreements are fair and that other countries play by the rules.
The President was proud to issue a proclamation declaring today the 45th Annual National Ag Day.
Earlier today, the President was pleased to welcome Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House.  This meeting provided an opportunity to make progress on a range of issues, including Syria and its sponsors, Yemen, the GCC, and our Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
Today, we were able to engage with Saudi leadership, as we do on an ongoing basis, to increase our coordination on regional issues, advance shared strategic objectives, and develop new channels and capabilities to institutionalize these interactions.
This afternoon, the President also met — will also meet with top law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and administration leaders to discuss the threats of lawless sanctuary cities.
Sanctuary jurisdictions release thousands of criminal aliens out of our prisons and jails, and back into our communities.  Such policies threaten the safety and security of our people.
Every American family deserves to live in safety and security in their home and neighborhood.  Sanctuary cities make that goal much more difficult to achieve.  And the President is committed to restoring the rule of law in these communities.
We’re also continuing to monitor the situations, both in Austin, Texas and in Maryland.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims involved in these situations, and we’ll continue to work with state and local law enforcement officials around both of those incidents.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-032018/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Apologies for the delay.  As you all saw, the White House rolled out the President’s school safety plan this morning.  Every student should be able to feel safe and secure at their school, and no parent should have to worry whether their child will come home at the end of the day.
With that in mind, the President’s plan focuses on the following areas: First, hardening our schools.  We will ensure our schools are safe and secure, just like our airports, stadiums, and government buildings, with better training and preparedness.
Second, strengthening background checks and prevention.  President Trump is supporting legislation and reforms to strengthen the background check system and law enforcement operations.
Third, reforming mental health programs.  The President is proposing an expansion and reform of mental health programs, including those that help identify and treat individuals who may be a threat to themselves or others.
And finally, continuing this important conversation, in addition to these immediate actions, the President is reviewing additional policy and funding proposals for school violence prevention.
These focus areas were identified after numerous meetings with students, teachers, lawmakers, and local officials, and the President will continue to lead the way on keeping our children safe.
Looking ahead to next week, President Trump will welcome Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to the White House on March 20th.  The President looks forward to discussing ways to strengthen ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and to advance our common security and economic priorities.
I’d also like to announce that the President will travel to Peru and Colombia next month.  This will mark the President’s first trip to Latin America.  He will attend the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru and will participate in a series of bilateral, multilateral, and cultural engagements.
This travel highlights the President’s resolve to deepen our historical ties with our partners in the region and our joint commitment to improve security and prosperity for the people of the Americas.  The President is looking forward to meeting with partners and allies who share our values and believe, as we do, that the promise of a safe and prosperous future rests in strong democracies, fair and reciprocal trade, and secure borders.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-031218/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you all saw, the President delivered remarks at the Latino Coalition Summit this afternoon.  The business leaders in attendance are living proof that the American Dream is back and stronger than ever under President Trump’s leadership.
As the President noted, last year Hispanic unemployment reached the lowest level in history.  It has now remained below 5 percent for the longest period ever recorded.
Latino-owned businesses are thriving like never before, contributing nearly half a trillion dollars for our economy last year alone.  And with the President’s pro-growth policies, this is only the beginning.
The last couple of weeks, we have been highlighting Senate Democrats’ historic efforts to obstruct the ability of the government to function.  A stunning 43 percent of the President’s highly qualified nominees are still waiting for confirmation in the Senate.  Senator Schumer’s tactics have led to 102 fewer confirmations than the next closest administration.
As I noted before, blocking Ric Grenell from serving as Ambassador to Germany is putting our national security in jeopardy.
Today, I’d like to highlight Yleem Poblete.  It has been almost 150 days since Dr. Poblete was nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance.  She would work to verify compliance of arms control, including disarmament agreements and missile defense cooperation.
We need her in place so she’s able to fully represent the United States at upcoming international meetings to discuss Syria’s use of chemical weapons, and to participate in April’s Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee meetings.  Say that really fast.
And yet, Senator Schumer is holding her up, putting the safety and security of the American people and, frankly, the entire world in danger.
Senator Schumer is blocking nominees indiscriminately.  He forces time-wasting procedural votes on nominees, and then eventually votes in support of them.
Just yesterday, the Senate had to waste precious floor time on a universally respected nominee, Terry Doughty, who was confirmed 98 to 0.  Even Senator Schumer eventually voted in favor of the nominee, yet still demanded the Senate go through archaic Senate procedure that delays votes and wastes the American people’s time.  It’s a disgrace, it’s dangerous, and it must come to an end.
And with that, I will take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-030718/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you all saw, the President and First Lady enjoyed their time today with Prime Minister and Mrs. Netanyahu.  The bond between the United States and Israel is the strongest it has ever been.
The President’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital made good on the promises of numerous past Presidents.  And he appreciates Prime Minister Netanyahu saying today that his decisive action will be remembered by the Israeli people throughout the ages.
Our two nations stand united against terrorism and those who fund it, as well as in our shared goal to build a more peaceful and prosperous Middle East.
Before taking your questions today, I’d like to introduce you to a few special guests we have here with us in the briefing room.  Retired Marine Corps Sergeant John Peck and Staff Sergeant Liam Dwyer both served combat deployments in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  The President met both of them recently at Walter Reed.
Sergeant Peck suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq during his first tour of duty.  Then, after two years of therapy, he re-enlisted and deployed to Afghanistan.  While there, he stepped on an IED and lost both arms and legs.  He spent two years at Walter Reed, and in 2016 received a double arm transplant.  He is now doing physical and occupational therapy at Walter Reed, and doing incredibly well.
Staff Sergeant Dwyer endured a roadside bomb explosion in Iraq, but he re-upped and later went to Afghanistan.  While there, he stepped on an IED, resulting in the loss of his left leg and severe injuries to his right arm, leg, and torso.  Doctors were able to save his limbs and reattach them through over 50 surgeries.  And after previously spending four years at Walter Reed, he is back there to receive additional surgeries in the coming months.
Thank you both for your service and for inspiring us all with your bravery, sense of duty, and resilience.  These men represent the very best of America, and remind us why it’s so important to make sure our great veterans get the care they deserve.
Transforming the Department of Veterans Affairs has been one of the President’s top priorities.  We’ve announced plans for the VA to shift veterans’ electronic medical records to the same system used by the Defense Department.  This will end a decades-old rift in sharing information between the two agencies.
The President signed an executive order to ensure veterans can receive care outside of the VA system, when needed.  He signed into law a bill empowering senior VA officials to fire failing employees who are not taking care of our vets.  As a result, accountability is being restored.
He signed into law a bill streamlining the lengthy process that veterans undergo when appealing disability benefits claims.  Hundreds of thousands of vets are awaiting decisions regarding their appeals.  The President is pushing the VA to use the new, streamlined process to work through the backlog as quickly as possible.
He also signed a bill authorizing $2.1 billion in additional funds for the Veterans Choice Program.  This program helps vets facing long wait times or long distances from nearby VA facilities by empowering them to receive quality care outside of the VA system.  The White House has also set up a VA Hotline, staffed by veterans, to help vets needing assistance and quick answers.
I could continue with the list, but this should leave no doubt that President Trump is serious about taking care of our veterans.  They sacrifice so much for us, and we must never let them down.  Thank you, Sergeants Peck and Dwyer, for being with us here today.
And I met them while we were at Walter Reed, and they promised that they would be on their best behavior but we’ll see how that goes.  And if it gets really tough, I’m very happy to refer questions to both of them because I’m pretty sure that as tough as they are, they could certainly handle anything that is thrown at them.  But hopefully we don’t have to do that.
Major, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-030518/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Let me start by saying what a meaningful experience it was to attend yesterday’s ceremony preceding the lying in honor of Reverend Billy Graham.  Reverend Graham left this Earth last week, but his legacy will live on for eternity.
As the President said during his remarks, “Everywhere he went, Reverend Graham delivered the same beautiful message: God loves you.”  That’s a message that we should all stop and really consider a little more often.  The President and First Lady will also be attending Reverend Graham’s funeral in North Carolina tomorrow.
I’d like to highlight some positive and important work the House did on Tuesday by passing H.R. 1865.  This bill empowers federal, state, and local prosecutors to hold websites accountable for supporting the sale of sex-trafficking victims.
As you may recall, the President and Ivanka Trump met with survivors, law enforcement officials, and victims’ advocates here at the White House.  He made it clear that this administration will fight to hold sex traffickers accountable and to ensure survivors have the support they need.
This bill is an important step forward.  And the White House appreciates the House taking action on a bipartisan basis.
Earlier this week, I mentioned that we were going to begin regularly highlighting the historic obstruction of Senate Democrats, an issue that threatens the safety and security of the American people.
As a reminder, compared to the four previous administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees.  Half of the President’s highly qualified nominees are still waiting on confirmation.
Today, we have another example.  Two-hundred and seventy-six days ago, Kevin McAleenan was nominated to be Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  Kevin’s primary responsibility would be to help safeguard American borders, keeping both terrorists and their weapons out of our nation, all while facilitating lawful international trade.  Kevin should be preventing terrorists and contraband from entering the nation, yet he is still awaiting Senate confirmation.
Senator Schumer should stop putting the safety and security of the American people at risk and immediately confirm him.
And with that, I will take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-03012018/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  This afternoon, the President is looking forward to officially announcing the new Chairman of his Board of Advisors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., who will be taking on this important role, is the former president of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and is currently CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management.
As you all know, the President previously signed an executive order promoting excellence and innovation at HBCUs.  He believes this initiative will advance America’s full human potential.  And with today’s announcement, he continues to demonstrate his commitment to HBCUs.
Before taking your questions today, I want to take a moment to highlight the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats — an issue that represents a threat to America’s interests and security.
Compared to the four previous administrations, this Senate has confirmed the fewest nominees.  Senator Schumer’s tactics have led to 73 fewer confirmations than the next closest administration.  Half of President Trump’s nominees are still waiting for confirmation in the Senate.
The obstruction is so out of control, even some Senate Democrats believe it is inappropriate.  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said, “I don’t believe we should be holding nominees hostage…Enough is enough.  We need people who are qualified to fill these important positions in our government.”
In the coming days, we will be highlighting specific, qualified nominees who are, as the Senator said, being held hostage by Senator Schumer.
Take, for instance, Ric Grenell, the President’s nominee to serve as Ambassador to Germany.  Mr. Grenell, a Harvard-educated, experienced diplomat, was the longest serving U.S. spokesperson at the United Nations.  He was nominated in September of last year.  He was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support.  He is waiting to represent America’s interests and be our country’s top voice in a G7 country.
In short, Senator Schumer’s hyper-political delay on Mr. Grenell puts our national security, and America’s foreign policy interests, in jeopardy.  The Senate should move to confirm him immediately.
We will continue highlighting more of these examples of Democrat obstruction in the days ahead.
Finally, I’m sure — on a lighter note, I’m sure you all remember 11-year-old Natalie Dalton, who wrote in to the President, offering to cook for him.  We’re excited to announce today that Natalie, and her 8-year-old cousin Celia, will be coming to the White House on March 23rd to work with the White House kitchen staff.  We look forward to hosting them.
And with that, I will take your questions.  Jonathan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-022718/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Due to all the events at the White House today and the President being out, we’ll keep this fairly quick.  Also, I flew back in this morning, so bear with me a little bit.
But it’s great to be back with everybody.  After traveling with the U.S. Presidential delegation to the Winter Olympics closing ceremonies, led by Ivanka Trump, the entire country is very proud of our athletes.  Not only did they perform well in their events, they did it with extraordinary class and sportsmanship.
On a personal note, it was a real privilege to meet many of our athletes and their families, and they are just as impressive off the field as they are on.
In addition to the athletic competition, these Winter Games were also important from a diplomatic perspective.
On Friday, the United States announced the largest-ever set of new North Korea sanctions.  Companies and countries around the world should know that the Trump administration is 100 percent committed to the permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  And we are watching closely who joins us in fully enforcing United States and United Nations sanctions.
We will continue to lead a campaign of maximum pressure on the regime.  We also believe that there is a brighter path available to North Korea.  They have expressed a desire to hold talks.  But let us be completely clear: Denuclearization must be the result of any dialogue with North Korea.  Until then, the United States and the world must continue to make it known that North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs are a dead end.
Here at the White House today, the President was pleased to welcome America’s governors.  The governors participated in breakout sessions on pressing issues facing our states.
Perhaps most importantly, the President led a session on safe schools and safe communities.  It was a productive dialogue with our state leaders, and came on the heels of other listening sessions the President hosted with survivors, students, teachers, family members, and local officials.
The President is committed to ensuring the safety of our schools and communities, and he wants to hear ideas from Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs.
He believes we must make our schools a much harder target for attackers.  We must protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, while keeping guns out of the hands of those who pose a danger to themselves and society.  And we must create a culture that cherishes life and human dignity, condemning violence rather than glorifying it.  The President will not rest until these goals are achieved.
Finally, I am pleased to officially announce the first state visit of the Trump administration.  The President and First Lady will welcome President and Mrs. Macron of France to the White House on April 24th.  This visit will advance American and French cooperation on economic and global issues, and deepen the friendship between the two countries.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

4605,Trump,2018-02-23 06:40:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on North Korea Sanctions,Nan,"
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Hello, everybody.  Today, the Treasury Department is announcing the largest set of sanctions ever imposed in connection with North Korea.
This action targets the deceptive shipping practices that have enabled the Kim regime to fund its dangerous weapons programs.  Our actions target shipping and trade companies, vessels, and individuals across the world who we know are working with North Korea’s behalf.  Specifically, we are sanctioning 27 entities, 28 vessels, and 1 individual, all involved in sanctions evasions schemes.
Today’s actions will significantly hinder North Korea’s ability to conduct evasive maritime activities that facilitate illicit coal and fuel transports, and limit the regime’s ability to ship goods through international waters.
Our actions are part of the ongoing maximum economic pressure campaign to cut off sources of revenue that this regime derives from U.N. and U.S. prohibitive trade to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
We are also issuing a global shipping advisory, in conjunction with the Coast Guard and the State Department, to put everyone on notice of North Korea’s illicit maritime tactics and underscore the significant sanctions risk of engaging in maritime business with North Korea.
We are releasing new imagery of the deceptive shipping practices used by those who aid and profit from illicit trade with North Korea.  These images from December 2017 reveal ship-to-ship transfers of fuel and other products destined for North Korea in an attempt to evade sanctions.  They shine a spotlight on the practices employed by the government of North Korea to falsify identifying information on ships and conceal illicit cargo.
These sanctions — evasion tactics are prohibited by U.S. Security Council resolutions, and we are fully committed to shutting down those who engage in trade with them.
Through today’s actions, we are putting companies and countries across the world on notice that this administration views compliance with U.S. and U.N. sanctions as a national security imperative.  Those who trade with North Korea do so at their own peril.
The United States will leverage our economic strength to enforce President Trump’s directive that any company that chooses to help North Korea fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs will not be allowed to do business with anyone in the United States.
Kim Jong-un’s nuclear program serves one goal: to keep him in power, even as his people starve and suffer.  The United States will not sit idly by while he threatens American allies and territories.
This administration is committed to full, irreversible, and permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  And our actions today, against those who continue to fuel this rogue regime, amplifies our strong resolve to achieve that end.
And I’m happy to answer any questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-north-korea-sanctions/

4612,Trump,2018-02-22 09:12:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah and Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett,Nan,"
MR. SHAH:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Since its founding in the 1940s, the White House Council of Economic Advisers has written and delivered a report to Congress on the annual Economic Report to the President.  The 2018 report, which was delivered yesterday, covers the President’s economic successes to date and our agenda going forward.
To dig into the details, we have with us today, Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  Kevin will make a brief statement and answer your questions on the economic report.  Then I’ll be back to take your questions on the news of the day.
So with that, I’ll give it to Kevin.
MR. HASSETT:  Thanks a lot, Raj.  And, you know, it’s kind of a dark, dreary day.  And I heard the White House Press Corps was a little bit depressed.  And so I said, “Well, let’s do some economics and cheer everybody up.”  (Laughter.)
And digging around the Chairman’s office, I noticed that on my bookshelf there was a copy of the first Economic Report of the President from 1947.  And Harry Truman, in it, said this:  He said, “The economic report is an opportunity for national self-examination and self-criticism.  It’s a challenge to the President and the Congress to determine the causes of whatever problems we face in our economic life and to find the solutions of those problems.”
And that’s what we endeavor to do at the Council of Economic Advisors, and what we’ve endeavored to do in this report that came out yesterday.  We briefed the President on it yesterday at 11:30 in the Oval Office, and I encourage you all to read it because it’s really a scintillating read.
The economic report has eight chapters.  The first chapter is an economic outlook, where we project that our policies will create about a 3 percent growth rate going forward over the next 10 years.  Real GDP will be about $2 trillion higher in 2028 because of President Trump’s policies.
And then each of the chapters after that go into taxes and growth, deregulation, labor market policies, infrastructure investment, enhancing global trade, and innovative policies for America’s health.  They all basically go into a big literature that looks at how our policies will affect economic growth.
And we start with a baseline of 2.2 percent growth and show that we can get to 3 percent growth just by adding up what the academic literature says about the economic effects of our policies.
Now, we’re supposed to also come up with measures of our nation’s problems that help set priorities and quantify how bad our problems are.  We have two attempts in the Economic Report to do that.  One is, we have a chapter on cybersecurity, where we did a lot of original research to find that cyber theft is costing us about $100 billion a year right now, in the U.S., in 2016.
And the second thing that we did is we looked at the opioid crisis, where we find that that’s costing us about $500 billion a year to help us set the priorities.
And with that, that’s what the economic report says.  I’ve got just a few minutes for questions.  But also, anyone who wants to reach out to us and come over to the CEA office can ask me questions there.
And I’ll start with you in the back.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-raj-shah-chairman-council-economic-advisers-kevin-hassett-02222018/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Apologies for the delay.  I’m very sorry for being late and making everyone wait.
Last week, while many around the country celebrated Valentine’s Day, a deranged killer murdered 17 people and injured at least 15 more at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
As you all saw, the President visited the hospital and sheriff’s department in Broward County last week.  He and the First Lady spent time with some of the victims who are recovering, thanked the doctors for their work, and praised the bravery of law enforcement and first responders.
Here at the White House, the victims and families have constantly been in our thoughts and prayers.  We’ve prayed for the recovery of those injured, and for peace and comfort for the families of those who were lost.
Our broken hearts are filled with gratitude, as we heard the stories of incredible heroism.  Fifteen-year-old Anthony Borges was shot five times while he used his body as a human shield for his classmates.  He remains in the hospital in recovery.  Anthony, thank you for your courage.  We are all rooting for you.
Assistant football coach Aaron Feis shielded students from a hail of gunfire, selflessly giving his own life to save others.
Teacher Scott Beigel was barricaded in his classroom, but chose to open his door to let students run into safety.  That decision cost Scott his life, but saved the lives of so many others.
Numerous other teachers sheltered students in their classrooms.
Tomorrow, we will be hosting parents, teachers, and students here at the White House to discuss efforts to ensure safety at our schools.  Members of the Parkland community will be attending this listening session, as will individuals who were impacted by past school shootings, including the Columbine and Sandy Hook tragedies.
On Thursday, we will be hosting local officials, including members of the law enforcement community, to continue that conversation.
As the President has said many times, it is the right of every American child to grow up in a safe community.  That begins in America’s neighborhoods, where the brave men and women of law enforcement have the President’s full support.  And it extends to our schools, where teachers across our nation invest their lives in their students.  No parent should ever have to wonder if their child will return home from school at the end of the day.
The President has expressed his support for efforts to improve the federal background check system, and, in the coming days, we will continue to explore ways to ensure the safety and security of our schools.
As you are aware, later today — actually, right now — in the East Room, the President will award the Medal of Valor to 12 public safety officers.  They include law enforcement officers, emergency medical personnel, and firefighters.  And the President looks forward to recognizing them for risking their lives to protect American citizens and communities.
The honorees are individuals who have exhibited exceptional courage, regardless of personal safety, to save or protect human life.

4666,Trump,2018-02-13 09:41:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Many of you probably saw Protective Life Corporation’s announcement this morning.  As a direct result of the Trump tax cuts, the Alabama-based company is raising their minimum wage to $15 per hour, and giving a $1,000 bonus to over 2,000 of their workers.
For those of you keeping track, we now have over 350 companies that have announced wage increases, bonuses, new hiring, or increased retirement benefits as a direct result of tax reform, which not a single Democrat supported.  These announcements have affected over 4 million American workers.
The President is working to build an economy that works for all Americans.  The tax cuts and reforms are a big part of that, and so is infrastructure.
As you all saw yesterday, the President unveiled a Legislative Outline for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America.  To cure decades of neglect, we are committed to quickly building a safe, reliable, and modern infrastructure to meet the needs of the American people and to fuel economic growth.
And to help make this possible, we have a very special announcement today.  In keeping with his campaign pledge, the President donates his salary on a quarterly basis to further work being done on important projects.
Most recently, the President donated his third-quarter salary to help the Department of Health and Human Services combat the opioid epidemic.  Prior to that, he donated to the Department of Education and the National Park Service.
And today, the President is proud to donate his fourth-quarter salary — 2017 salary to the Department of Transportation to support their programs to rebuild and modernize our crumbling infrastructure.
Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao is here to accept the check.  I’d like to bring her up to say a few words, take a couple of questions on infrastructure and about how these funds will be used.  And I trust that you’ll stay on topic, and then I’ll be back up afterwards to answer your questions on the news of the day.
With that, Secretary Chao.  Thank you so much for being here.
SECRETARY CHAO:  Thank you.  We have to get this check here, and with all of us.  (Laughter.)
Thank you.  Thank you, Sarah.  I’m accompanied here, in case you were wondering, by two officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation.  I have with me, Derek Kan, Undersecretary of Policy, and Jim Ray, the Senior Advisor to the Secretary for Infrastructure.  They’re here because of this gift.  And so let me proceed.
As many of you have heard yesterday, 12 federal agencies have been working with the White House on the comprehensive infrastructure proposal that the President announced yesterday.  Transportation is one component.  The proposal also includes energy, drinking and waste water, broadband, and veterans hospitals, as well.
The goal of the President’s proposal is to stimulate at least $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment, which includes a minimum of $200 billion in direct federal funding.  And a key element is to empower decision-making at the state and the local level because state and local officials know best the infrastructure needs of their communities.
Many of you know that the principles are behind this, and so I wanted to reiterate some of the principles.  The principles behind this proposal are, one, to use federal dollars as seed money to encourage infrastructure investment by the states, localities, and the private sector.  Two, provide for the infrastructure needs of rural communities.  Three, streamline project delivery.  And four, invest in transformative projects that benefit everyone.
We are already applying these principles to the Department of Transportation’s major existing infrastructure grant programs, including, for example, the INFRA grants.  And that is why these two gentlemen to my right are here — because their offices will be among those at the Department of Transportation that will be taking the applications and also administering these INFRA grants.
This quarter, as mentioned, the President has generously decided to donate his annual salary to the Department’s INFRA Grant Programs.  INFRA directly reflects the President’s proposal by providing dedicated, discretionary funding for projects that address critical issues facing our nation’s highways and bridges and ports.
Under the INFRA program, states and localities that secure some funding or financing of their own are given higher priority access to federal funds.  In addition, INFRA also reserves at least 25 percent of its funding to be awarded to rural projects.
So infrastructure is the backbone of our economy, and it’s key to keeping our country competitive.  The President’s proposal will create new jobs, strengthen our economy, and improve the quality of life for everyone.
And so with that quick summary, I’ll be more than glad to answer any questions.
Yes, John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-secretary-transportation-elaine-chao/

4693,Trump,2018-02-08 10:40:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah,Nan,"
MR. SHAH:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I want to start with a statement, and then we’ll take your questions.
Our normal policy, consistent with the policies of past administrations, is to not comment on background checks and security clearances.  Given the unusual nature of these circumstances and a number of false reports floating around, we wanted to try to explain as best that we can, within our security limitations, how the background investigation process works, and then talk a little bit about Rob Porter and how his situation fits within that process.
The background investigation process is the process for evaluating allegations about a White house staffer’s conduct prior to joining the White House.  It’s run by the federal law enforcement and intelligence communities.  It’s used throughout the U.S. government.  It’s thorough, it’s complex, and it takes time.  It takes time because we want to get it right.  It’s also costly, but it’s absolutely worth it.
Over the course of any investigation, some information may arise that seems troubling or complicated, and requires additional investigating.  It’s important to allow that process to continue in order for a fulsome understanding of the information.
The whole U.S. government takes this process seriously.  It’s not politicized or interfered with, but we do not push — we do push for — we do push to obtain accurate, fulsome information as quickly as possible.
Now let me talk about Rob Porter.  The allegations made against Rob Porter, as we understand them, involve incidents long before he joined the White House.  Therefore, they are best evaluated through the background check process.
It’s important to remember that Rob Porter has repeatedly denied these allegations, and done so publicly.  That doesn’t change how serious and disturbing these allegations are.  They’re upsetting.  And the background check investigates both the allegations and the denials.  The investigation does not stop when allegations comes to light.  It continues to determine the truth.
We should not short-circuit an investigation just because allegations are made, unless they could compromise national security or interfere with operations at the White House.  The truth must be determined.
And that was what was going on with Rob Porter.  His background investigation was ongoing.  He was operating on an interim security clearance.  His clearance was never denied, and he resigned.
To summarize, the allegations against Rob Porter are serious and deeply troubling.  He did deny them.  The incidents took place long before he joined the White House.  Therefore, they were investigated as part of the background check, as this process is meant for such allegations.  It was not completed, and Rob Porter has since resigned.
During his time at the White House, Rob received no waivers and no special treatment.  And this is the tried and true process.  It was followed meticulously.
We hope this helps explain how seriously these matters are taken and how the process works to investigate such allegations.
With that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-raj-shah-020818/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.
We are pleased that Congress has been able to meet our defense spending requirement and come together on a two-year spending bill.  This deal achieves our top priority: a much-needed increase in funding for our national defense.  This deal also increases budget caps, ends the sequester, and provides certainty for the next two years.
Defense spending will match the request made by the Pentagon, and will reflect what the President signed into law with the National Defense Authorization Act.  The bottom line is that, thanks to President Trump, we can now have the strongest military we have ever had.
Additionally, this deal increases the debt ceiling to March of 2019, which moves us away from crisis-to-crisis budgeting.  It also ensures funding for our other critical priorities, including rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, tackling the opioids epidemic, and taking care of our great veterans.
To discuss this agreement in more depth from a military perspective, we have Secretary Mattis here with us today.  Secretary Mattis will come up to make a brief statement and take a few questions on the importance of funding our armed forces, and then I will be back up after him to answer questions on news of the day.  Thank you.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY MATTIS:  Thank you.  Well, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for taking time out of your schedules to be here today.
I’ve spent the last day and a half on Capitol Hill briefing the members of Congress on our 2018 National Defense Strategy.  I’m heartened that Congress recognizes the sobering effect of budgetary uncertainty on America’s military and on the men and women who provide for our nation’s defense.
Two days from now, I will visit our nation’s 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade at Fort Benning as they prepare to deploy to Afghanistan.
To advance to the security of our nation, these troops are putting themselves in harm’s way.  In effect, signing a blank check payable to the American people with their lives.  Our military has been operating under debilitating continuing resolutions for more than 1,000 days during the last decade.
During last week’s State of the Union Address, President Trump said, “Weakness is the surest path to conflict.”  In a world awash in change, with increasing threats, there is no room for complacency.
Failure to implement or fund the 2018 National Defense Strategy will leave us with force that could dominate the last war, yet be irrelevant to tomorrow’s security.  We need Congress to lift the defense spending caps and support a 2-year budget agreement for our military.  America can afford survival.
For too long, we have asked our military to carry on stoically with a success-at-any-cost attitude.  The fact that our volunteer military has performed so well is a credit to their dedication and professionalism.
We expect the men and women of our military to be faithful in their service, even when going in harm’s way.  We have a duty to remain faithful to them.
Absent a budget this year, America’s military will not be able to provide pay for our troops by the end of the year.  We will not be able to recruit the 15,000 Army soldiers, and 4,000 Air Force airmen required to fill critical manning shortfalls; we would not be able to maintain our ships at sea with the proper balance between operations and time for training and maintenance; we would have to ground aircraft due to a lack of maintenance and spare parts, degrading our pilot’s proficiency; we would deplete the ammunition training and manpower required to deter war; and we would delay contract for vital acquisition programs necessary to modernize our force.
I cannot overstate the negative impact to our troops and families’ moral from all this budget uncertainty.
Today’s Congressional action will ensure our military can defend our way life, preserve the promise of prosperity, and pass on the freedoms you and I enjoy to the next generation.
Thank you.  I can take a couple questions here.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-secretary-defense-james-mattis-02072018/

4767,Trump,2018-01-29 08:50:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Over the weekend, the White House released a framework for responsible immigration reform that will protect our people, put the interests of American workers first, and provide a permanent solution to DACA.
Our framework includes four pillars:  border security, including the wall; DACA legalization; ending extended-family chain migration; and eliminating the visa lottery, moving us toward a merit-based system of immigration.  We look forward to working with Congress to pass and sign legislation that addresses each of these four pillars.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, as you know, the President will deliver his first State of the Union Address.  The theme of the address is, “Building a safe, strong, and proud America,” which is exactly what the President has worked to do during his first year in office.
I don’t want to get ahead of what the President will say during his remarks, but it will obviously be must-watch TV, but I do want to make an announcement about one of the most important traditions: the guests who will be sitting in the First Lady’s Box.  I’ll name a few of those individuals and little bit about them.
First, Corey Adams:  Corey is a skilled welder at Staub Manufacturing Solutions in Dayton, Ohio.  Last year, Corey and his wife were able to become first-time homeowners, and they will invest their extra money from the Trump tax cuts into their two daughters’ education savings.
Elizabeth Alvarado, Robert Mickens, Evelyn Rodriguez, and Freddy Cuevas:  These two couples are the parents of two beautiful young girls, Nisa and Kayla, who were brutally murdered by MS-13 gang members.
Corporal Matthew Bradford: In 2007, Corporal Bradford stepped on an IED while deployed in Iraq.  He was blinded by the blast and lost both of his legs.  After multiple surgeries and therapy, he became the first blind double amputee to reenlist in the Marines.
Jon Bridgers: Mr. Bridgers founded the Cajun Navy in 2016, a non-profit rescue and recovery organization that responded in 2016 to flooding in south Louisiana and in 2017 to Hurricane Harvey in Texas.  He and his team have helped thousands of people across the South.
David Dahlberg: Mr. Dahlberg is a fire technician who saved 62 children and staff members from a raging wildfire that encircled their camp in southern California.
Officer Ryan Holets: Ryan serves as a police officer in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  In his six years on the force, he has been shot twice and experienced several near-death encounters.  Officer Holets and his wife adopted a baby from parents who suffered from opioid addiction, breaking down walls between drug addicts and police officers to help save lives.
Ashlee Leppert: Ms. Leppert rescued dozens of Americans during last year’s devastating hurricane season.
Agent “CJ” Martinez: Agent Martinez is a Special Agent for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations unit.  His investigations have led to more than 100 arrests of MS-13 gang members who were prosecuted for crimes including homicide, assault, and narcotics and weapons trafficking.
Staff Sergeant Justin Peck: Last year, Staff Sergeant Peck was part of a team clearing IEDs from territory previously controlled by ISIS.  When one of his compatriots was struck by a blast, he rushed to their side, saving their life while risking his own.
Preston Sharp: Mr. Sharp has organized the placement of more than 40,000 American flags and red carnations on soldiers’ graves as part of his goal to honor veterans in all 50 states and to challenge others to join the Flag and Flower Challenge.
Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger: These siblings started Staub Manufacturing Solutions 20 years ago.  Thanks to the Trump Bump in the economy, they were able to grow to new heights in 2017.  And thanks to the Trump tax cuts, they were able to give all of their employees larger Christmas bonuses.
Some of these individuals’ stories are heroic, some are patriotic, others are tragic.  But all of them represent the unbreakable American spirit, and will inspire our nation to continue growing stronger, prouder, and more prosperous.
And with that, I will take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-01292018/

4795,Trump,2018-01-24 09:39:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Sorry for the very delayed start today.
The President spoke earlier today with Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin and offered his deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims of the attack at Marshall County High School.
We are preparing to leave tonight for Switzerland, where the President will be attending the World Economic Forum.  Director Cohn and General McMaster did a great job previewing that trip to all of you yesterday, so I won’t add too much more to their remarks.
The President is very much looking forward to delivering the message to the world that America is open for business and that there is no better time in history to invest and create jobs here in the United States.
As you all know, this week is National School Choice Week.  Secretary DeVos has been a strong leader on this issue for many years, and she’s doing a great job leading the charge at the Department of Education.
The President released a proclamation officially declaring this National School Choice Week.  “To maintain our global leadership and strengthen our modern economy,” he wrote, “America’s education system must prepare students for the unforeseen challenges of the future.  By giving parents more control over their children’s education, we are making strides toward a future of unprecedented educational attainment and freedom of choice.”
“During National School Choice Week, I encourage parents to explore innovative and educational alternatives, and I challenge students to dream big and work hard for the futures they deserve.  I also urge state and federal lawmakers to embrace school choice and enact policies that empower families and strengthen communities.”
On the nominations front, we were pleased to see the Senate confirm the President’s highly qualified nominee to chair the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.
We’re also pleased that the President’s HHS Secretary nominee, Alex Azar, cleared his final procedural hurdle in the Senate on a bipartisan basis.  We look forward to Mr. Azar’s confirmation so we can continue working to lower healthcare costs and increase the quality of care for all Americans.
Finally, before taking your questions, I’d like to deliver a statement and update regarding the path forward on immigration:
“Last fall, the White House sent Congress a list of the core reforms necessary to fix our immigration system.  These reforms were assembled in coordination with frontline law enforcement officers and career public servants who know what is necessary to keep America safe.
Since that time, President Donald J. Trump and his administration have hosted dozens of meetings with Republican and Democrat leadership, and rank-and-file members of the House and Senate, to discuss these reforms and find a bipartisan path forward.  Based on these negotiations, the White House will release a legislative framework on Monday that represents a compromise that members of both parties can support.  We encourage the Senate to bring it to the floor.
This framework will fulfill the four agreed-upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes; ending extended-family chain migration; cancelling the visa lottery; and providing a permanent solution on DACA.  After decades of inaction by Congress, it’s time we work together to solve this issue once and for all.  The American people deserve no less.”
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Zeke.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-012418/

4801,Trump,2018-01-23 10:47:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President — a couple of updates here before we get started.  The President has been briefed on the shooting at Marshall County High School in Kentucky.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families there, and we offer our sincerest appreciation to the heroic Marshall County deputy who apprehended the shooter.
A few more updates before we bring up a couple of special guests.  I’d like to leave no doubt where the White House stands on the Flake, Graham, and Durbin agreement on immigration reform.
In the bipartisan meeting here at the White House two weeks ago, we outlined a path forward on four issues: serious border security, an end to chain migration, the cancellation of the outdated and unsafe visa lottery, and a permanent solution to DACA.
Unfortunately, the Flake-Graham-Durbin agreement does not meet these benchmarks.  In fact, it would not secure our border, encourage more illegal immigration, increase chain migration, and retain the visa lottery system.  In short, it’s totally unacceptable to the President and should be declared dead on arrival.
The President has been extraordinarily consistent on immigration and what his priorities are.  His views are shared by the vast majority of the American people, and have bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.
Moving along, we have some incredible economic news to share today.  JPMorgan Chase announced this morning that because of the Trump tax cuts, they will raise wages for 22,000 of their employees, create thousands of new jobs, and increase small business by lending $4 billion.
In total, these moves are part of a $20 billion investment plan, for which JPMorgan Chase directly credits the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as the President’s historic efforts to rolling back job-killing regulations.
Also, Disney announced that over 125,000 employees will receive a $1,000 cash bonus, and the company is investing $50 million into a new employee education program.
Lastly, Verizon announced today that all of their employees, other than the top management, will receive 50 shares of restricted stock.  This amounts to about $2,500 per employee.  “Employees will further share in the company’s success,” Verizon said in a release.
We’re only one year in and the President is just getting started, but we’re pleased to see that our great American workers and families are already feeling the positive effects of the President’s policies.
As you know, the President will be traveling to the World Economic Forum later this week.  So I’ve brought in a couple of special guests today to preview that trip.  NEC Director Gary Cohn, who played a major role in the tax reform effort, and National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster will discuss the trip and answer questions specific to that topic.  And then I will be up with more information and to take your questions.  Thanks.
General.
MR. COHN:  Thanks.  I’m not General.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-012318/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Obviously, the impending conclusion of the Schumer Shutdown is leading media coverage today, and I’ll get into that shortly, but I want to start with a couple of other national security issues first.
First, on northwest Syria, we call on all parties to remain focused on the goal of defeating ISIS, deescalating and resolving the Syrian conflict, and protecting innocent civilians.
We hear and take seriously Turkey’s legitimate security concerns and are committed to working with Turkey as a NATO ally.
Increased violence in Afrin disrupts what [was] a relatively stable area of Syria. It distracts from international efforts to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS, It could be exploited by ISIS and al Qaeda for resupply and safe haven. And it risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.
We urge Turkey to exercise restraint in its military actions and rhetoric; ensure that its operations are limited in scope and duration; ensure humanitarian aid continues; and avoid civilian casualties.
We want to ensure that Assad’s brutal regime cannot return to Afrin, and we will continue working diplomatically to end the Syrian civil war.
In Afghanistan, where terrorists attacked a hotel in Kabul, such attacks on civilians only strengthen our resolve to support our Afghan partners. We commend the swift and effective response of the Afghan security forces. Afghan forces, with our support, will continue to relentlessly pursue the enemies of Afghanistan, who also seek to export terror around the world.
We call on Pakistan to immediately arrest or expel the Taliban’s leaders and prevent the group from using Pakistani territory to support its operations.
Lastly, in regards to the government shutdown, we were pleased to see Senator Schumer accept the deal that President Trump put on the table from the very beginning, which was to responsibly fund the government and debate immigration as a separate issue.
I have a statement here from the President of the United States that I will read:
“I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses and are now willing to fund our great military, Border Patrol, first responders, and insurance for vulnerable children. As I’ve always said, once the government is funded, my administration will work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration. We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it’s good for our country.”
And with that, I will take your questions. Jonathan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-012218/

4824,Trump,2018-01-20 09:21:00+00:00,Press Briefing by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short on the Government Shutdown,Nan,"
MR. SHORT: Good afternoon. This morning, the President has spoken to Leader McConnell and to Speaker Ryan, to Leader McCarthy. He also received updates from Secretary Nielsen about the impacts of payments not — salary not going to our border agents. He also spoke with Secretary Mattis, who gave him an update about 90,000 National Guardsmen and 20,000 Army Reservists who have had their training cancelled because of the government shutdown; additional costs that they’ve had to incur, including they have to pick up their own pay and travel costs.
We stand here ready to sign the bill that the House passed last night, anxious to keep the government open — or, I should say, to reopen the government. The White House position, though, remains the same: that we will not negotiate the status of 690,000 unlawful immigrants while hundreds of millions of taxpaying Americans, including hundreds of thousands of our troops in uniform and border agents protecting our country are held hostage by Senate Democrats.
We continue to remain anxious to reach a deal on DACA, and we look forward to resuming those negotiations as soon as the Senate Democrats reopen the government.
The reality, though, that is difficult for, I think, many Americans to understand is, if you put forward a bill that continues funding the government, reauthorizes health insurance for 9 million children, provides a relief of taxes that Democrats and Republicans on a bipartisan basis, the rational for shutting down the government over a bill that Republicans and Democrats agree with on the basis of saying, “We will not negotiate, we will not reach a resolution to open the government until there’s a solution on a tangential issue that remains plenty of time to be solved,” I think a lot of Americans have a hard time understanding how you make the argument of why we’re not going to pay our men and women in uniform, our agents serving on the border, in order to try to resolve an issue that we also want to resolve related to unlawful residents.
We look forward, I think, that the Senate Majority Leader is going to offer — as you know, has already offered a continuing resolution that goes to three weeks instead of the original four weeks. We look forward to that vote. We hope that Senate Democrats will yield and accept that their position is unreasonable, and reopen the government to make sure that our men and women in uniform continue to get paid.
Director of OMB, Mick Mulvaney, is here to address the status of the update and how it’s impacting government agencies, and then we’ll take a few questions.
DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Good morning — or good afternoon. A couple different things. I’ll walk through some of the — how a lapse in appropriations, a shutdown works. Keep in mind, the technical term, the legal term, is actually a lapse in appropriations. So when you saw the notices go out today, they reference a lapse. That is the formal name for the shutdown.
This morning — early this morning, federal workers got notices from their various agencies as to whether they were exempt or furloughed employees. They, sort of, fell into three categories: either you were exempt and you were to come to work either today or Monday, depending on your ordinary work schedule; you were absolutely furloughed, in which case you were not to come to work beginning today and going over to Monday; or there’s actually another group of people that would show up for a few hours on Monday or today, up to four hours, in order to close down shop or prepare for the lapse. So those notices went out today.
I mentioned yesterday that this shutdown, this lapse, would look different than it did in 2013. We’re already seeing evidence of that, and I want to walk you folks through a couple ways it’s already different.
In 2013, most of the EPA shut down immediately during the lapse. The EPA this year, consistent with OMB guidance and direction from the President, is using its unobligated balances, what we call those carry-forward funds. Most of the agency will remain open, like several years ago.
Mine safety inspection: The number of inspectors that will be on the job for mine safety inspections will increase from 25 percent of the total in 2013 to 50 percent. Here, again, part of the administration’s intentional plan to use unobligated funds that are already at the agency — something the previous administration did not emphasize.
Cybersecurity: Agencies will ensure that staff working on the maintenance and safeguarding of IT systems will continue to work during the lapse, and that systems will continue to get their critical updates.
National parks: You may have already noticed that the parks, national monuments, private concessions — private concessions that serve them — are open. As I mentioned yesterday, won’t be picking up the trash or cleaning the bathrooms.
Number five, trade negotiations: During the last shutdown, I think the Obama administration cancelled a few very high-level trade negotiations. By contrast, this year, the USTR will use its funding flexibilities. We talked, again, about the ability to use carry-forward funds; the ability to use transfer of funds from one account to another in order to continue round six of the NAFTA negotiations later this week.
Finally, the last example I have is that the Merchant Marine Academy was closed during the 2013 shutdown. It will stay open.
There’s another important example that doesn’t compare apples to apples to 2013, but it is, sort of, evidence of how we’re managing this differently than the Democrats did during the 2013 shutdown. After working closely with the White House, with OMB, to review the exceptions allowed in the law for agencies to continue to operate if their work is necessary to protect life and safety, the CDC has announced this morning they will continue immediate response work and surveillance to protect Americans from seasonal influenza.
So we’ll have continued updates on that either later today or tomorrow as to how the shutdown, how the lapse, if it continues, is managed.
With that, I think we’ll take a couple of questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-omb-director-mick-mulvaney-legislative-affairs-director-marc-short-government-shutdown/

4834,Trump,2018-01-19 06:14:00+00:00,Press Briefing by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short on the Potential Government Shutdown,Nan,"
DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Morning.  Just here to get you folks up to speed on where things stand regarding the potential lapse in funding — the shutdown.
OMB is preparing for what we’re calling the “Schumer shutdown.”  It still surprises me — and I’ve been through some of these before — that the Democrats in the Senate are opposing a bill that they don’t oppose.  They’re for clean CRs; they’re for the extension to the CHIP program.  Many of them support the delay in some of the taxes, most specifically the medical device tax, the Cadillac tax, especially.  They don’t oppose anything in the bill, but they are opposing the bill.
I just want to let everybody know that we don’t want this.  We do not want a shutdown.  But if Mr. Schumer insists on it, he is in a position to force this on the American people.
From an OMB perspective, because we’re involved in managing a lapse or a shutdown — and we want to make folks understand that it will look very different than it did under the previous administration.  One of the things that I’ve learned since I’ve been in this office is that — there’s no other way to describe it — but the Obama administration weaponized the shutdown in 2013.  What they didn’t tell you was that they did not encourage agencies to use carry forward funds, funds that they were sitting on, nor did they encourage agencies to use transfer authority.
They could have made the shutdown in 2013 much less impactful, but they chose to make it worse.  The only conclusion I can draw is they did so for political purposes.  So it will look different this time around.  We’ve also got — we can answer questions — take your questions about specifics on that.
Marc Short is also here to give you a very brief update on where we stand, and then we’ll take your questions for a few minutes.
You want to go ahead?
MR. SHORT:  Thank you all for your time this morning.  As Mick said last night, the House passed a bipartisan bill with 230 votes.  The President stands ready to sign that bill to keep the government functioning and afloat.  It appears, unfortunately, that Senate Democrats are entrenched in forcing a shutdown.
I think that there’s obviously a lot of hypocrisy in this town.  I think there’s some ironies to point out.  As the Director said, Nancy Pelosi a couple years ago called them, “I call them legislative arsonists” —
DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  That was me.  (Laughter.)
MR. SHORT:  — in referring to those who were voting for a shutdown at the time, commenting that, “They’re there to burn down what we should be building up, in terms of investments in education and scientific research.”
Chuck Schumer said at the time, “It’s sort of like this.  Someone goes into your house, takes your wife and children hostage, and then says, let’s negotiate over the price of your house.”  In essence, that’s the same tactic they’re deploying.
Last night, I’m sure many of you know, you all asked Senator Feinstein her position, and she said that if the government shuts down, people will die.  And as a follow-up question on how she’s going to vote, she said she hasn’t decided yet; people are going to die, I don’t know how I’m going to vote on this.’
So here we are.  I think the reality is that this is not about policy, it’s about politics.  As Mick said, we’re not familiar with anything in this CR that Democrats are opposing.  In fact, they champion and support the CHIP program.  This will reauthorize it for six years.  I believe a new study says there are 9 million children now getting health insurance through that program.  The reality is that we will jeopardize payments for our military and our troops and those serving on the frontline of our country, both at Customs and Border Patrol, ICE, those who are trying to protect our borders and protect our country.
This is a serious issue.  We are frustrated, obviously, because Mick’s job is to submit a budget to Congress.  Let’s keep that in perspective.  Mick does that in February.  Congress has months to complete appropriations process.  The fiscal year ends on September 30th; we’re now in mid-January.  It is frustrating to all of us that we’re in this position.
But what’s unclear is, what is it that Democrats are asking in order to get out of a shutdown?  It seems that they are just hell-bent on getting to a shutdown.  We are anxious to make sure that our troops and those serving on the frontlines of our country continue to get paid.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-omb-director-mick-mulvaney-and-legislative-affairs-director-marc-short-on-the-potential-government-shutdown01192018/

4846,Trump,2018-01-17 08:16:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Ed O’Callaghan,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Let me start by previewing some of the President’s plans for the rest of the week.
Tomorrow, he will travel to H&K Equipment company near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  H&K began as a small family business a half-century ago.  2017 was the best year in company history, which they credit to the President’s pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-growth economic agenda.
Thanks to the passage of the Trump tax cuts, H&K will now be able to expense 100 percent of the investments they make in new equipment in the same year they buy it.  According to H&K, this means their investments back into the company will be 50 percent higher than this last year.  That means millions of dollars will be invested in growing their business rather than propping up the bloated government in Washington.
When they buy more trucks and equipment for their rental fleet, they hire more technicians to service them, buy more service vehicles to transport those techs from customer site to customer site, and buy more parts from their suppliers to keep the rental fleet running.  All of this economic activity spurred by the tax bill will result in more jobs, higher wages, and a brighter future.
The President looks forward to spending time with some of the workers who are reaping the benefits of the tax cuts and reforms, and we know this is just the beginning.
On Friday, we’re excited to announce that the President will become the first sitting President to address the March for Life from the White House live via satellite.  This will take place from the Rose Garden.  The President is committed to protecting the life of the unborn, and he is excited to be part of this historic event.
Now we have a guest here with us today from the Department of Justice.  Ed O’Callaghan is here to discuss the Section 11 report, which was released yesterday by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.
I won’t steal Mr. O’Callaghan’s thunder, but this report highlights the urgent need for Congress to adopt the immigration reforms identified in the administration’s priorities.
I’ll bring him up now so he can make a statement, answer a couple of questions.  And as usual, I know you will all be on your best behavior and ask him questions on this topic only.  And then I will be happy to come back up and answer other questions on news of the day.
Ed.
MR. O’CALLAGHAN:  Good afternoon.  My name is Ed O’Callaghan, and I am the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department’s National Security Division.
In my capacity as Principal Deputy, I assist the Acting Assistant Attorney General in the supervision of the 350 dedicated investigators and prosecutors who carry out the Department’s highest priority: protecting the United States from threats to our national security.
I’ve been with the National Security Division since November of last year.  Previously, from 1999 to 2008, I was an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York.  From 2005 to 2008, I was co-chief of the Terrorism and National Security Unit in the Southern District of New York.  And some of the cases I worked on, of course, during that time included the investigation into the 9/11 attacks that occurred while I was an assistant United States attorney in the Organized Crime and Terrorism Unit of the Southern District of New York.
I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today about yesterday’s release of the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security’s Section 11 report.  The report, titled after Section 11 of President Trump’s Executive Order 13780, Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Entry into the United States, was a collaborative effort between the DOJ and DHS to respond to E.O. 13780’s directive to provide information to the American people regarding the number of foreign nationals charged with or convicted of terrorism-related offenses or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related or other national security reasons.
The Justice Department’s National Security Division maintains a list of individuals convicted of international terrorism-related charges in U.S. federal courts between September 11, 2001 and December 31 of 2016.  As indicated in the report, as of December 31 of 2016, there are 549 individuals on that list of convictions of terrorism — international terrorism-related offenses.
A subsequent DHS analysis of those 549 individuals convicted of international terrorism-related offenses determined that approximately 73 percent — or 402 of these 549 individuals — were foreign-born.  A further breakdown of the U.S. citizenship status of these individuals at the time of their respective convictions shows that 254 were not United States citizens, 148 were foreign-born, naturalized, and received U.S. citizenship, and 147 were U.S. citizens by birth.
I’ll point out that one of the cases that’s highlighted in the Section 11 report refers to a defendant who we convicted in the Southern District of New York named Uzair Paracha.  Mr. Paracha came into the United States, I believe, in 1980 as a family member of a legal permanent resident.  Mr. Paracha was ultimately convicted of providing material support to al-Qaeda.  It’s a case that I supervised when I was chief of the terrorism unit in the Southern District of New York.
The evidence in that trial showed that Mr. Paracha attempted to assist other individuals who were affiliated with al-Qaeda to try to enter the United States based on false statements in immigration documents.  And in fact, Paracha assisted and took on the persona of one of the individuals who he was attempting to try to get back into the United States to commit terrorist acts here.
The individual statements provided by that individual demonstrated that he was attempting to come back into the United States to commit attacks on gas stations in New York — my hometown.  And by the fact that we were able to prosecute Paracha, it stopped that attempt to engage in additional terrorist attacks here in the United States.
Additional items included in your report demonstrate that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided information that shows that there have been approximately 1,716 removals of aliens since September 11, 2001, because of national security concerns — a designation that is determined by ICE, within the Department of Homeland Security.
Obviously, there are certain times where, although there are national security concerns about foreign-born individuals who are in the United States, a federal prosecution, for one reason or another, is not the suitable way to go about dealing with the threat posed by that individual.  So the immigration authorities have other tools at their disposal — one of them being the removal tool, which is cited by ICE in the Section 11 report.
It is the case that the threats to our national security are not showing any signs of relenting.  In Fiscal Year 2017 alone, DHS encountered 2,554 individuals on terrorist watch lists, formerly known as the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database.  Those individuals were, of course, attempting to get into the United States.
Additional important statistics provided by DHS and documented in the report include the fact that between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2017, a total of 355,345 noncitizen offenders were administratively arrested after previously being convicted of an aggravated felony or two or more crimes, each punishable by more than one year, a regular felony.
During that same time period, according to DHS, 372,098 noncitizen offenders were removed from the United States after conviction of an aggravated felony or two or more felonies.
And between Fiscal Year 2010 and Fiscal Year 2017, Customs and Border Protection — CBP — identified and prevented the boarding of 73,261 foreign travelers on flights destined from the United States who may have presented an immigration or security risk.
In a statement yesterday about the report, Attorney General Sessions indicated that there are currently thousands of terrorism-related investigations into thousands of people in the United States, including hundreds of people who came here as refugees.
In addition, citing surveys previously commissioned by DOJ components, the report noted that there are an estimated 23 to 27 honor killings every year in the United States, and that there are an estimated approximately half-a-million women and girls in the United States at risk of undergoing the abhorrent practice of female genital mutilation.
In October of last year, the Trump administration laid out a series of immigration policy objectives to ensure safe and lawful admission to the United States, defend the safety and security of our country, and to protect American workers and taxpayers.
There are three pillars to this immigration policy: border security, immigration enforcement, and a merit-based immigration system.  From the cases I have worked on, I know that foreign terrorist organizations, transnational criminal organizations, and other individuals and entities that wish to harm the United States undoubtedly seek to exploit weaknesses in our immigration system when it benefits them in accomplishing their unlawful schemes.
President Trump’s immigration policy is designed to serve the interests of national security.  Enhanced vetting and screening and continuing screening promote the discovery of information that would help immigration and law enforcement authorities identify foreigners who may pose national security threats to the American people.
Rather than basing admission decisions on programs that lack accountability, like diversity visa lotteries and extended family chain migration, adopting a merit-based system rewards skills and qualities that include but are not limited to education, English-language proficiency or fluency, and/or job skills.
As a prosecutor tasked with protecting our nation’s security, I know some of our cases have involved exploitation of vulnerabilities in our current immigration system.  The Attorney General is committed to restoring law and order in our immigration system so that we can address and work to eliminate the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by those seeking to undermine our public safety.
Those are my brief remarks.  I’m happy to take some questions.  Sir, in the middle.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-and-principal-deputy-assistant-attorney-general-ed-ocallaghan01172018/

SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  We’re pleased to see that the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through 25,000 for the first time ever today.  The President’s economic agenda of lower taxes, less regulation, and more opportunity for all is already paying off, and American families and workers are the big winners.
With that in mind, we have a message from a special guest that I’d like to share with you.  With that, I’ll ask you to tune into the screens, and then I’ll continue from there.
(A video of President Trump is played.)
“Thank you for being with us today.  The historic tax cut I signed into law just two weeks ago, before Christmas, is already delivering major economic gains.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are seeing larger paychecks, bigger bonuses, and higher pension contribution, and it’s all because of the tax cuts and the tax reform.
And I want to thank all of the companies that worked so hard to do it.  Workers at AT&T, Bank of America, Comcast, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and many other companies are receiving bonuses of $1,000 or more.  Aflac and others are investing more in employees’ 401(k)s.  CVS announced it will hire 3,000 new workers.  Boeing, another great company, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in employee training and infrastructure. 
More than 60 companies have announced they are raising wages, including many that have voluntarily raised their minimum wage to $15.00 per hour — and I mean they did that voluntarily, which many politicians said could only be achieved by government mandate.
Investing in the American worker is the most important investment a business will ever make.
I want to thank all of these companies for putting their tax savings to the best possible use by creating more jobs and higher wages for the American family.  These great results are just the beginning.
When the dreams of the American people are unleashed, there is nothing — absolutely nothing — we can’t achieve.  We are going to make America great again, and it’s happening a lot faster than anyone thought possible. 
Thank you.” 
Thank you, Mr. President.  As he said, this is only the beginning, and we are excited to see the economic growth and optimism continue to soar in 2018.  Earlier today, the President hosted Republican senators to talk about responsible immigration reform.  He reiterated our view that any action on DACA must come with action on the President’s immigration reform principles, which were released last year.
These include a physical border wall on the southern border; interior enforcement, which includes more ICE and Border Patrol agents; as well as a crackdown on sanctuary cities; and reforms to our legal immigration system, like ending chain migration and the visa lottery program in favor of a merit-based immigration system.
Next week, the President is inviting a bipartisan group of senators to the White House to discuss next steps on responsible immigration reform and to continue that discussion.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Jeff.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders01042018/

4962,Trump,2017-12-21 11:03:00+00:00,Background Press Briefing on Year-End Accomplishments,Nan,"
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hey, folks. So just to set the ground rules — this is a background briefing with senior administration officials. It’s on background because a lot of folks here and elsewhere have been writing about this topic, which is year-end stories and the President’s first year, and so we wanted to share our perspective. If you guys want things on the record or want to discuss other components of this and want to work together on stories, the press office is available.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. Hi, everyone. Happy Holidays. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Thanks for your attention today. As was mentioned, this is off the record, attributable to senior administration officials. If you want anything beyond that, you’re always welcome to reach out to us.
This has been a very strong year of accomplishments for the President. I know it’s often said that yesterday was his first major legislative win, but, actually, there have been 81 pieces of legislation by our count that are now the law. That’s in addition to 15 congressional review acts whereby the President took a look at laws that were passed without the benefit of congressional review, and decided to reverse or undo them.
In addition, the President, as of yesterday, along with Congress’s help, has passed the most sweeping tax cuts and reform in at least a generation, if not two. And that is the centerpiece of his overall economic agenda. That overall economic agenda also is reflected in energy independence. It’s also reflected in him surpassing the “two out for every new one in” regulation promise from the campaign. He mandated that, but instead he’s eliminated roughly 22 regulations for every new one that’s been introduced. That’s saving about $8.1 billion. Of course, you know we had the deregulation event recently, and Neomi Rao at OIRA is supplying us some very positive statistics with respect to that.
The tax cut yesterday is meant to provide about $5.5 trillion in tax cuts where nearly 60 percent is going directly to hardworking American families. I think the charge that it benefits the wealthy was upended almost immediately when a number of major employers across this country, many who were headquartered in states where the senators did not vote for the tax cuts package, went ahead and said that they would invest in their workforce — $1,000 bonuses for 200,000 employees at AT&T, for example.
You have Wells Fargo making a commitment to invest — do some capital investments. You have some of our major employers going forth and telling their employees, we’re going to reinvest the tax cut savings directly and immediately in you. That happened, in some cases, before the Congress and the President even took to the South Portico for their event.
Before that, the anticipation and the expectation of the tax cut helped to spur economic growth — two consecutive quarters of 3 percent of better GDP. Some nonpartisan economists estimate we can get close to 4 percent imminently. You’ve seen the stock market respond with about $6 trillion-plus of wealth created. Since the President was elected, the stock market going from 18,000 to over 24,000. Consumer confidence at a 17-year high. Small business formation confidence. Manufacturing confidence at a record high.
We’ve worked very closely with the National Association of Manufacturers on Manufacturing Day, and on identifying those men and women who work in manufacturing — recognizing that those are often legacy businesses. We talk an awful lot about family farms, but it actually is true that many manufacturing businesses are also family-based, and many of them are very excited to see the 2.9 percent or so unemployment rate among manufacturers and this new tax cut package.
The New York Federal Reserve estimates the U.S. economy will grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Of course, we know that this country had 3 percent or better growth for decades until 2007, and that we were told since then that 2 percent of less was something we should settle for; that was the best we could do. This President has proved that we can do much better and that we are doing much better.
I would point out, in the two consecutive quarters of 3 percent or better GDP, that in one of those quarters — and rightfully so — we had billions of dollars in hurricane relief and recovery spending, and yet still hit the 3 percent GDP mark.
Yesterday was a three-for-one. Yesterday was the tax cuts, which of course will benefit hardworking Americans; will benefit the job creators, going from 35 percent to 21 percent, going from the highest rate in the OECD and the developed world. In terms of a corporate rate, to 21 percent, which puts us below the average of 23 percent.
But it also repealed the individual mandate under the ACA and Obamacare. Nearly 80 percent of households hit with the Obamacare mandate make less than $50,000 a year. So this is direct relief for them. And we all know the statistics — the most recently available statistics — that about 6.5 million Americans opted to pay nearly $3 billion in penalties for Obamacare. Rather than get on Obamacare, they opted to pay money to the IRS, money they could have used, I would argue, for many things, including buying healthcare. But they opted to pay a penalty to the IRS rather than get Obamacare.
That individual mandate is gone and, of course, was set up to try to attract the young and the healthy to the exchanges. And that did not happen. But what did happen is many of the insurers fled the exchanges. You’ve seen the statistics we have. And if you need them, we have many counties in this country now that have one or zero insurers in that county.
The most recent government statistics show close to, if not 30 million Americans now don’t have healthcare. That’s post-Obamacare. That’s post the lie that you can keep the plan, you can keep your doctor. So this President is very committed in making sure that those Americans who don’t have healthcare can find the accessible, affordable way to achieve that over time.
The courts are really another highlight for this President in his first year in office. Of course, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch will have his mark on American jurisprudence that is expected for decades to come. The President promised during the campaign, and actually named names — and Judge Gorsuch, Justice Gorsuch was one of them. He put his list forward and said, this is the type of justice and judge that I’d be looking for for our Federal Circuit and Supreme Court, but, in fact, he also named names so people could examine the records, can see their judicial thinking long before the election, and certainly long before these appointments.
In addition, as Leader McConnell mentioned yesterday in the South Portico, that we have 12 circuit judges confirmed. That’s the highest number since we’ve been reporting the numbers. I believe President Obama had three at this point in his first year. So 12 in the circuit court and about 135 to go.
So this will continue to be a place where the President’s mark will be seen.
Defeating ISIS — a physical caliphate will soon be extinguished, according to our national security team and defense team. The President has — our forces have helped to liberate Mosul and Raqqa, and we have an aggressive new strategy that empowers commanders with broader authority. This President is rebuilding our military and leading the way toward respecting our military as well. That is something that doesn’t get a ton of coverage, but, as you can imagine, if there was a bright-line distinction between the two candidates for President and for Commander-in-Chief, it was certainly over the way to characterize terrorism and what to do about it once one of them was elected.
Restoring American energy independence on the way to — to quote Senator Murkowski — American energy dominance is also a highlight. That was the three-for-one yesterday. That’s the third piece. Tax cuts for jobs creators, for job seekers and for jobholders; certainly the repeal of the Obama[care] individual mandate, and ANWR. For 40 years in the making, other Presidents, other Congresses tried to do it. It got done by way of this tax cut plan.
But that really builds on other energy independence and dominance measures that this President put forward early in his administration by opening up the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines; plans to auction off leases for nearly 77 million acres on the Gulf of Mexico for exploration. Ending the war on coal, having the coalminers here, frankly, early in the administration — they were very happy. But U.S. coal exports are up 70 percent year to date for September.
And then, of course, exiting the Paris Climate Agreement, saying he wants to take a look at — like he does with the trade deals — how fair it is to American interests, American workers, and American taxpayers.
Recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel and initiating plans to relocate our U.S. embassy there — again, a promise that Presidents right, left and center all made, and that this President kept — all in his first year in office.
Declaring a nationwide public health emergency to address the opioid crisis: We are in the process of releasing the White House’s response to the Commission’s report. I am told that is one of — it was a report that got among the most comments internally that we’ve ever seen in anything we’ve done here this year. And I think that shows the administration-wide effort — that, plus our commissioning of an opioids cabinet where we have a great deal of accomplishments, really, administration wide. The DOJ recently announced the first two prosecutions that — Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein announced the first two prosecutions — excuse me, indictments in this country of Chinese nationals under the fentanyl ring prosecution (inaudible). And those two happened in North Dakota and Mississippi.
In addition, the DOJ has recently called upon — Attorney General Sessions recently called upon every U.S. attorney in this country to have an opioid designee, at least one, in their offices; an additional $12 million in grants to “Back the Blue” for our law enforcement interdiction practices. They shut down the AlphaBay dark web — a lot of it peddling of the illicit and synthetic opioids. You see in the CDC numbers that are out today, they’re very harrowing. Opioids now kills more people than breast cancer. And we see a spike-up — if you look at page four of that particular report — you see a spike-up in fentanyl deaths. And we have a fentanyl issue in this country.
HHS recently gave clarification on HIPAA guidelines so that we’re working on those Americans who tell us that their child had been resuscitated five or six times in the same hospital but they never knew that because the child is an adult, and how to, maybe, designate a family member or another responsible adult if, in fact, you are in that situation.
And I think that accomplishments in the veterans space is pretty significant. Secretary Shulkin and President Trump have the VA Accountability Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act. They have a 24/7 hotline here at the White House for the first time. The Secretary and the President have made a priority the VA Choice Act, where if our veterans cannot access timely, quality care through the VA — which mostly they can — they instead are able to access it through the private sector, as many do.
In addition, the President and the Department of Justice has been working with Central American partners to address directly the MS-13 gangs that are threatening our communities. The facts for DHS is 796 MS-13 gang member arrests and associates this calendar year. That’s an 83 percent increase. Over the last year, you’ll recall the President himself in July or August going up to Long Island to speak about this directly.
We have specifics and statistics on each of these areas. I wanted to give an overview with a little bit of meat, but we have much more. I don’t want to take up all of your time, and we certainly want to open it up to questions.
But I would end by saying that the fair and reciprocal trade for America’s workers has been a big centerpiece and a big difference for this President, the idea that we’re bringing tens of billions of dollars in foreign investments back to the United States. The President has met with over 100 leaders, and he’s visited 13 countries. And the fruits of that are really seen in these tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment back here, withdrawing the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, and renegotiating trade agreements like NAFTA, which will continue into 2018.
I think looking toward 2018, many of the fruits of labor that’s being done this year will be realized in 2018 and beyond. And I consider it an accomplishment that so much of this has started. On so many issues, we’ve inherited a sinking battleship, have tried to stick the anchor in the ocean and turn it around going to a different direction. And we will see many of the fruits of that labor is following here.
If you look at the President’s 70-point immigration plan, it includes ending chain migration, going to a merit-based system, ending the visa lottery system. It talks about equipping our border agents with the resources they need to do their job, and adding more ICE agents at the border. It addresses DACA; it addresses the wall, and made a 70-point plan.
Looking forward to 2018 — infrastructure, welfare reform, obviously the budget, finishing on some of these issues that we’ve previewed. And, indeed, in continuing to crush ISIS and encourage our NATO allies to continue to contribute to the common defense.
So all of that are not just promises kept by the President, but they’re what he sees as moral imperatives in terms of this country being more safe, more prosperous, and this government being more transparent and more accountable to its citizenry. Thank you very much.

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As I’m sure you all just saw, the House of Representatives voted for final passage on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  That brings us one step closer to the President making good on his promise to deliver tax cuts for Christmas.
We are looking forward to the Senate vote later this evening, and the President will be monitoring these developments throughout the day.
As December winds down, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to look back at what has been, by any measure, a historic year.
Nearly 1.7 million new jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, the lowest rate in 17 years.  The stock market reached a record high more than 60 times and closed above 24,000 for the first time in history.
We’ve rolled back twenty-two regulations for every one new regulation, saving taxpayers over $8 billion and liberating America’s economy from the grip of bloated government.
We’ve withdrawn from, or began renegotiating the trade deals that once threatened to destroy American industry and shipped our jobs around the world.
We finally set up our nation on a path to not only energy independence, but energy dominance.  We approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, directed the EPA to end the job-killing war on coal, and upon the tax bill’s passage, will have opened up ANWR to responsible energy exploration.
The President has protected America’s communities.  We’ve seen the lowest level of illegal border crossings on record.  We ended the Obama administration’s dangerous catch-and-release policies, restoring law and order both on the border and in the interior.  And we’ve designed and built eight wall prototypes for the border wall.
We’ve taken unprecedented steps to tackle America’s opioids epidemic by directing the declaration of a nationwide public health emergency.
And we’ve promoted peace through strength.  Under the President’s leadership, ISIS has lost nearly all of its territory and its most important strongholds in Iraq and Syria.
We’ve restored old alliances, forged new ones, begun rebuilding our military, and made it clear to the world that there is no greater ally, no more fearsome adversary than the United States of America.
We’ve reshaped the American judiciary for generations.  Justice Gorsuch was confirmed to the Supreme Court, and 22 judges have been confirmed, including a record-setting 12 circuit judges.  We protected life by reinstating and expanding the Mexico City Policy that protects $9 billion in U.S.-taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions.
And this evening, hopefully upon passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the President will have delivered the most significant tax cut in the history of the nation and repealed the Obamacare individual mandate.
The President has delivered on promise after promise, issue after issue, time after time, and we’re just getting started.
As some of you may have seen yesterday, Disney World debuted its animatronic President Trump for its famed Hall of Presidents.
In the President’s remarks for the exhibit, which he recorded here at the White House earlier this year, he said, “From the beginning, America has been a nation defined by its people.  It’s why our Founders began our great Constitution with three very simple words: We the People.”
In the coming days, political analysts will write and the talking heads will discuss what this year means — what it means for the President, what it means for Republican and Democrat Parties, and for the never-ending political theater in Washington, D.C.
But I would encourage everyone to take a step outside of the Beltway bubble and consider what this year means for the American people.
To the forgotten men and women around our country, you are forgotten no more.  This President is with you 100 percent.  And as this year has already proven, he will never let you down.

4981,Trump,2017-12-19 04:09:00+00:00,Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea,Nan,"
MR. BOSSERT:  Good morning, all.  Sorry for being a little tardy this morning.  I’d like to talk to you today about a cyber issue of significance.
In May of this year, a dangerous cyberattack known as WannaCry spread rapidly and indiscriminately across the world.  The malware encrypted and rendered useless hundreds of thousands of computers in hospitals, schools, businesses, and homes in over 150 countries.  While victims received ransom demands, paying those demands did not unlock their computers.
This was a careless and reckless attack.  It affected individuals, industry, governments.  And the consequences were beyond economic.  The computers affected badly in the UK and their healthcare system put lives at risk, not just money.
After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea.  We do not make this allegation lightly.  We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners.
Other governments and private companies agree.  The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan have seen our analysis, and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry.
Commercial partners have also acted.  Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government, and others in the security community have contributed their analysis.
The stability of the Internet and the security of our computers is vital to free and fair trade and the fundamental principles of our liberty.  And accountability and cooperation are the cornerstone principles of our cybersecurity strategy.
North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade.  Many of you have reported on that.  Its malicious behavior is growing more egregious, and stopping that malicious behavior stops with this step of accountability.
The attribution is a step towards holding them accountable, but it’s not the last step.  Addressing cybersecurity threats also requires governments and businesses to cooperate to mitigate cyber risk and to increase the cost to hackers by defending America.  The U.S. will lead this effort.
President Trump has rallied allies and responsible tech companies around the free world to increase the security and resilience of the Internet.  Cooperation between industry and good governments will bring improved security, and we can no longer afford to wait.
We applaud our corporate partners, Microsoft and Facebook especially, for acting on their own initiative last week without any direction by the U.S. government or coordination to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers.  Microsoft acted before the attack in ways that spared many U.S. targets.
Last week, Microsoft and Facebook and other major tech companies acted to disable a number of North Korean cyber exploits and disrupt their operations as the North Koreans were still infecting computers across the globe.  They shut down accounts the North Korean regime hackers used to launch attacks and patched systems.
I’m extremely proud of the hard and dedicated work of the intelligence services and cybersecurity professionals.  And I’m very happy today to have one of the finest with me.
I’d like to introduce Jeanette Manfra, Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications at DHS.  We call today — I call today, and the President calls today, on the private sector to increase its accountability in the cyber realm by taking actions that deny North Korea and the bad actors the ability to launch reckless and disruptive cyber acts.
As responsible U.S. companies join us in this cooperation, it will fall to Jeanette and her leadership team — Chris Krebs, Secretary Nielsen.  They’re in charge, literally, of coordinating the operations that will protect us.
As we make the Internet safer, we will continue to hold accountable those who harm us or attempt to threaten us, whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organizations of hostile nations.
With that, I turn it over to Jeanette.  Thank you.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY MANFRA:  Thank you, sir.
At DHS, cybersecurity is a core mission of ours.  And just like preventing terrorism or responding to hurricanes and wildfires, it is a shared responsibility between government, industry, and the American people.
WannaCry is a great example of how this partnership works.  It began on May 12th, the Friday before Mother’s Day.  We first learned that something unusual was happening from our partners in the Asia-Pacific region.  As the malware traversed the globe, we received information from our partners in Europe.  As the day went on and the National Health Service in the U.K. was impacted, we knew we were dealing with a serious issue, and began to activate our domestic-industry partnership.
By midafternoon, I had all of the major Internet service providers either on the phone or on our watch floor sharing information with us about what they were seeing globally and in the United States.  We partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services to reach out to hospitals across the country to offer assistance.  We engaged with federal CIOs across our government to ensure that our systems were not vulnerable.  I asked for assistance from our partners in the IT and cybersecurity industry.  And by 9:00 p.m. that night, I had over 30 companies represented on calls, many of whom offered us analytical assistance throughout the weekend.
By working closely with these companies and the FBI throughout that night, we were able to issue a technical alert, publicly, that would assist defenders with defeating this malware.  We stayed on alert all weekend but were largely able to escape the impacts here in this country that other countries experienced.
In many ways, WannaCry was a defining moment and an inspiring one.  It demonstrated the tireless commitment of our industry partners, a moment that showed how the government and private sector got it right; that our preparation, our investments in cybersecurity, keeping our systems up to date, and sharing information paid off.
Although the WannaCry attack demonstrated our national capability to effectively operate and respond, we cannot be complacent.  We are seeing increased activity and sophistication from both nation-states and non-state actors.  In many instances, these are the same adversaries we have faced in the past.  They are just now operating in a different space.
Most devices are connecting to the Internet, which broadens the threat landscape and compounds the challenge for security practitioners.  And there is no sign of these trends abating in the years to come.  This is why cybersecurity continues to be one of the most significant and strategic risks to the United States.
In addition to broadening the threat landscape, we see some gaps between what an entity might consider adequate security for themselves or their sector and what is in the public’s interest.  The American people depend upon critical services and functions, such as electricity, a stable financial system, and dependable communications — all things that enable our modern way of life.  Many of these are run by the private sector.
Therefore, in order to ensure the security of these services and functions, we rely heavily on public-private collaboration.  This collaboration is entirely voluntary and provides companies with strong liability and privacy protections should they participate.
To ensure adequate security in the private sector, DHS plans to move beyond only offering voluntary assistance to more proactively becoming the world leader in cyber risk analysis and intervening directly with companies when necessary.
Specific to North Korea, we have issued technical alerts to assist network defenders in understanding the types of malware that they’re using, and urge them to remove them from their systems so that they cannot continue to have access to our infrastructure.  As we learned during the WannaCry attack, these incidents can have life-threatening consequences.
So how did we get here?  The Internet was engineered for interoperability, trust, and openness.  Innovation and automation equals efficiency and cost savings, but oftentimes the cost of security, which is too commonly an afterthought or bolted on after-market.  Attackers only have to be right once but defenders have to be right all the time.
Some say that defending cyberspace is impossible and that attacks are inevitable.  I disagree with this assumption.  We can take small tangible actions to make the cyber ecosystem safer.  Our goal is a cyber environment where a given threat, such as a malicious e-mail, can only be used once before it is blocked by all other potential victims.
We need to get the advantage to the defender.  We make it way too easy for attackers by operating independently.  Our adversaries are not distinguishing between public and private, so neither should we.  Government and industry must work together now more than ever if we are serious about improving our collective defense.  We cannot secure our homeland alone.  A company can’t single-handedly defend itself against a nation-state attacker.  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.  We all play a part in keeping the Internet safe.
To prevent another attack like WannaCry, we are calling on all companies to commit to the collective defense of our nation.  And this commitment does not end on our borders.  As identified in the WannaCry incident, cybersecurity defense is a global challenge.  As many as 150 countries had systems infected by this ransomware.  And it is only through international partnerships that the United States had time to prepare.
Therefore, we are working to strengthen our international partnerships with cybersecurity centers across the world.  We are taking a greater leadership role in cybersecurity at DHS.  We seek to drive the market toward more secure, scalable, and interoperable solutions.  Ahead of us lie great challenges, but even greater opportunities, which I know we can accomplish by working together.
Thank you very much.
MR. BOSSERT:  Thanks, Jeanette.  Questions?  Sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-on-the-attribution-of-the-wannacry-malware-attack-to-north-korea-121917/

4996,Trump,2017-12-14 11:01:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Administrator Neomi Rao on the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions,Nan,"
MR. CZWARTACKI: Good afternoon. We are here for a little briefing by Neomi Rao, who is the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the OMB. She will be here to offer a brief statement and take a few questions. For those on the phone or for anyone else, her name is spelled N-E-O-M-I, last name Rao, R-A-O.
And so without further ado — oh, one other point, she may call upon some staff that she has with her. Those staffers are on background, but everything else she says is on the record.
And without further ado, Neomi. Come on up, Neomi.
MS. RAO: Thanks, CZ. Great. So I’m very glad that the President was able to draw some attention today to the regulatory reform efforts that he has so successfully put in place.
And I just wanted to say a little bit — I think what we’ve achieved is some remarkable success in the area of regulatory reform, and I can mention some of the information, some of the data we have released. And I also wanted to just talk about how we’re doing this in a responsible way that is consistent with the law and also in a way that is promoting the principles of good government.
So the President mentioned in his speech — you know, he called, in January, to eliminate two regulations for each new one. In fact, through the end of September — so through the end of fiscal year ’17, we are actually at 22 regulations eliminated for each new one, which is 67 deregulatory actions and 3 regulatory actions.
That should result in a savings of $8.1 billion in present-value terms. So that is a net reduction in regulatory costs.
Also, looking ahead for fiscal year ’18, today, we released the agenda, which is an annual document released by OIRA. And in that, you can see we’re on track to continue to be better than three for one. The agenda reflects 448 deregulatory actions and 131 regulatory actions. And agencies project that that’s going to lead to about $10 billion in present-value cost savings. So we’re planning to keep up the deregulatory efforts.
And there is — you know, many commentators have suggested there is a link between these reform efforts and economic growth. I think one of the advantages of what is happening now is that individuals and businesses aren’t fearing the constant perpetuation of new regulatory burdens without any notice or due process.
From my perspective, a lot of this is linked to individual freedom. When the government is interfering less in people’s lives, they have a greater opportunity to pursue their goals. I also think that what we’re doing here is connected to making government more constitutional, which means that we’re working to ensure that agencies stay within the law, that they’re acting consistent with their statutory requirements, their procedural requirements, and we’re helping to promote better accountability in agencies.
And I also wanted to say that we’re working on this all in a way that’s consistent with longstanding principles at OIRA. We’re doing cost-benefit analysis for both regulatory and deregulatory actions in the same way. So we’re trying to be responsible and follow our longstanding practices with respect to deregulation as well as regulation.
And finally, if you look online, all of this information has been uploaded to RegInfo.gov, which is our website. And I think you’ll see that, if you’re familiar with the agenda, this is a very transparent agenda. We’ve improved search capabilities. You can look for actions based on whether they’re regulatory or deregulatory. We have provided a lot of information about how we are doing the cost allocations and the accounting under Executive Order 13771.
So we’re working on that transparency, and we continue to work with agencies on promoting the values of due process and fair notice.
So with that, I’ll be happy to take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-office-information-regulatory-affairs-administrator-neomi-rao-unified-agenda-regulatory-deregulatory-actions/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President will speaking at 2:30 on the administration’s efforts to reduce red tape and federal regulations.  Within 10 days of taking office, President Trump issued Executive Order 13771, instructing the Office of Management and Budget to remove two government regulations for every new one created.  Washington scoffed, but the administration acted.  And under a year, we have unleashed the American economy, businesses, and job creation.
These efforts, and the rest of the President’s agenda, have fueled economic growth, including all-time highs in the stock market, a 17-year low in unemployment rolls, new highs in manufacturing and consumer confidence, and much more.
As the President said yesterday, we’re at the final stages of historic tax cuts and reforms that will provide massive relief to middle-class families, lower tax rates on American businesses to make us more competitive, and make our tax code simpler and fairer for the first time in decades.
We want to begin lowering the tax bills in Americans’ paychecks starting next year, where Americans who faced economic headwinds for eight years will have the wind at their backs as they seek the American Dream.
And with that, we’ll get started because we are on a short timeframe.  And I will take your questions.

5006,Trump,2017-12-12 10:08:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Let me start by introducing Francis Cissna, the Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. He’s here to provide a briefing on the attempted suicide bombing in New York and how it was enabled by flaws in our immigration system.
After he speaks and takes some of your questions, I’ll be back up to answer questions on other news. And, as always, if you can stay focused on the topic at hand, that would be great. Thanks so much.
Director.
MR. CISSNA: Hello. I’m here to talk to you about yesterday’s incident and kind of give you some of the context and perspective in the immigration system — how it works, or how it didn’t work, in this case — and what are the sorts of things our administration is proposing to change it to make it better.
So, as you all know, yesterday, the suspect, Akayed Ullah, was arrested in an attempted bombing in New York City. And there’s an immigration aspect to this. The immigration aspect is that he immigrated to this county; he was a green card holder, a lawful permanent resident. He came to this country based on family connection to a U.S. citizen. He was a national of Bangladesh. The U.S. citizen in question was his uncle, and that U.S. citizen, many years ago, came to this country originally as a visa lottery winner.
So this is the general background. I now want to try to explain what all that means, where those terms come from, and what the significance of all that is.
First, I would explain that, for those who aren’t aware, our immigration system has two principal components. There’s a family-based component through which the suspect in yesterday’s attack — alleged bombing incident — came through. And there’s an employment-based component.
In any given year, we have about 1 million immigrants. One million people come here to get green cards, immigrant visas. In fiscal year ’15, for example, of that 1 million, about 72 percent of our immigrants came based on a family connection, and only 6 percent — or about 1 out of 15 — came based on an employment or job connection, job offer. So you can see the immigration system is heavily weighted towards family migration.
There are other categories of people that immigrate as well, besides just family and employment-based, including refugees, asylees, and, of course, the visa lottery people that I just referenced. But those are very small compared to those two larger categories.
I want to talk now about these in particular — the family-based, the employment-based, and then the visa lottery. In the family-based migration category, there are multiple categories of people. The principal category — family-based immigrants — are called “immediate relatives.” These are people who are the spouses or children, nuclear family members, of U.S. citizens. In a given year, you have about half a million people in that category. In fact, I have better numbers than that. In fiscal year ’16, in that category — these are people who are the nuclear family members of U.S. citizens — there were about 566,000 people that immigrated.
An additional category in the family-based universe are what are called “preference” categories. These are more extended family connections. These include unmarried — the first category — unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens; second category — spouses of green card holders, unmarried sons and daughters of green card holders; third category — married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens; fourth category is brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens and their children. That’s the category that yesterday’s suspect came in under.
So the suspect in yesterday’s bombing came in under the most extreme, remote possible family-based connection that you could have under current U.S. immigration law — that being the child of the sibling of a U.S. citizen.
Under the employment-based categories — that’s a much smaller number — only 140,000 slots are allocated in a year to that category, but you’re only really getting about half that number of actual workers because the spouses and children don’t count towards that category.
There you have a number of categories, including categories for extraordinary ability of workers. You have people with advanced degrees. You have people who are skilled professionals and immigrant investors. There’s multiple categories, but a much smaller number than the family-based categories. And again, I remind you, only 1 out of 15 of our immigrants come in under those skilled categories.
Let me turn now to the diversity visa, which is the other visa program that is relevant to yesterday’s events. The diversity visa, or visa lottery as it’s called colloquially, is a program that was established back in 1990. There were some precursor programs before that, but, basically, the program as we know it was established in 1990. That’s seen 50,000 people a year based on an immigration lottery.
The qualifications for registering for the lottery are that you have to be from a country that had low immigration in the previous five years, and the person who’s applying for the lottery has to either have a high school degree or, if they have no education, at least two years of experience in a job that requires two years of training. So the criteria are very low.
The problems with the visa lottery are various. First, because the criteria are so low, either you have no education at all and very little skills, or you have a minimum of education and no skills at all. And because it’s a lottery, pretty much anybody on the planet who is from a qualifying country can take advantage of this.
In 2003, the State Department’s Inspector General Office observed that this low eligibility criteria could lead to exploitation by terrorists. They warned about this in 2003. The GAO, in 2007, echoed that warning — again, warning that terrorists could take advantage of the diversity visa program.
Also, the program is racked with fraud. In 2003, the State Department IG, 15 years ago, noted that the program was rife with pervasive fraud. The fraud, the low eligibility standards, all these contribute to its potential exploitation by terrorists and other mala fide actors.
Bangladesh is an interesting case. That’s the country where yesterday’s suspect came from. That country was a high user of the visa lottery program. In fact, in 2007 — which was the peak year for that country’s use of the visa lottery — 27 percent of the immigrants from that country came through that program, through the visa lottery program.
Uzbekistan, which was the country of origin of the alleged — the truck driver from October 31st in New York City — in 2010, 70 percent — 7-0 percent — of immigrants from Uzbekistan came through the visa lottery program.
So that program is used as a prime avenue for immigration for many countries.
Finally, let me touch on the subject of chain migration. When I use that word, what I’m talking about is a person who comes to this country and who, in turn, employs one of these many avenues that I just described, principally family-based, to sponsor relatives who are in the home country to come and join him or her.
Because the categories that we have that I just described in family-based migration are so extensive, it’s not just nuclear family. You also have, as I say, adult unmarried children; brothers and sisters; nieces and nephews. You can sponsor a person like yesterday’s alleged terrorist at the extremity of that chain, and then that person, in turn, can sponsor people and so on, and so on, indefinitely.
Hundreds of thousands of people come into this country every year based on these extended-family migration categories. And it is my view, it our administration’s view, that that is not the way that we should be running our immigration system. A system like that, that includes something like the diversity visa program, these extended-family categories are not the way anybody would have designed this immigration system if we could start from scratch today.
What we need is an immigration system that is selective. We want to be able to select the types of people that are coming here based on criteria that ensure their success; criteria that ensure their ability to assimilate successfully in our country. And random lotteries, extended-family connections — that’s not the way to run our immigration system.
So I appeal — we appeal — to the Congress as they consider these matters as we speak, and in the coming weeks, to seriously take into account these concerns that we have with the way the immigration system is structured and its vulnerabilities, as I just described, and correct that.
At that point, my formal comments are concluded. I’ll answer any questions you have.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-121217/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. This morning, while New Yorkers were making their way to work, a terrorist set off a pipe bomb strapped to his body in one of Manhattan’s busiest commuter hubs. Thankfully, there were no life-threatening injuries.
Undercover Port Authority Police Department Officer Jack Collins apprehended the terrorist, along with several other officers. These brave first responders and the others who rushed to the scene are heroes. On behalf of the President and a grateful nation, we would like to thank them and commend them for their bravery.
This attack underscores the need for Congress to work with the President on immigration reforms that enhance our national security and public safety. We must protect our borders, we must ensure the individuals entering our country are not coming to do harm to our people, and we must move to a merit-based system of immigration.
Additionally, this attack comes as our coalition continues to make great gains against ISIS. Still, there is more work to be done on the ground in the shrinking ISIS-controlled areas, and the President’s plan to annihilate ISIS is moving forward.
But we must also destroy the evil ideology that is behind ISIS and attacks like today’s. This ideology has no borders but it must be eradicated. The President has successfully rallied the world behind this cause and we will not stop until it is accomplished.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Today is a solemn day of reflection across our nation, as we remember the “date which will live in infamy” when we were attacked at Pearl Harbor.
As the President said in a stirring video released earlier today, “We remember the lives that were lost, the families torn from loved ones, and the heroes who rose to America’s defense.”  The President will be meeting with members who served at Pearl Harbor later today, as you all know.
Also, as you’re aware, the President will meet later this afternoon with congressional leaders from both parties to discuss the need to fund the government, particularly our military and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The President and the Republicans in the House and Senate are eager to pass a bill fully funding the federal government and the military.  With the threats we are facing, our national security should not be held hostage for irresponsible demands.  And we certainly hope that won’t happen.
Now, with Christmas season is full swing, I want to shine a spotlight on some of the incredible stories of generosity and love that show what the Christmas spirit and the American spirit are all about.
Today, I’d like to start with a story of St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia.  The story starts over 100 years ago, when a young girl tragically died around the Christmas season, and her family donated money to the church in her honor and asked that the money be used for children at Christmas.  What they may not have realized at the time was that this act of kindness — in the midst of incredible heartache — would bless countless children for the next century.
To this day, St. Matthew’s continues helping children and families during the Christmas season.  They usually do it anonymously, but word of their generosity spread through social media this year.
At the local Walmart, numerous families will come to pay the bill for Christmas toys they had put on layaway, and be told that “there’s no need” because it’s already been paid in full.
There will be so many acts of generosity and kindness that go unnoticed this Christmas season, and that’s okay.  St. Matthew’s Church wasn’t looking for credit, and neither are so many others.  But these stories are important because they remind us of what this season is all about — and that’s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.  And, hopefully, we can all focus and take time out of our busy schedules to enjoy the Christmas season, or however you may celebrate.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-120717/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you saw, the President just wrapped up a meeting in the Oval Office with four families from different parts of the country.  They are veterans, small-business owners, workers, moms, dads, and students.  And they all had one thing in common: The President’s plan to cut taxes and reform our broken tax code will help them thrive and build a better life and a better future for themselves and their children.
This event was an important reminder that while Washington focuses on the politics of the day, the President is focused on the forgotten men and women around our nation.  These are the families who deserve a tax cut for Christmas, and that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver.
Looking ahead, the President will visit Mississippi on Saturday, where they are celebrating the state’s bicentennial, 200 years of statehood.  To mark the occasion, the President will participate in the grand openings of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.
Tomorrow, First Lady Melania Trump and Second Lady Karen Pence will travel to Texas to continue their efforts in assisting those affected by this year’s devastating hurricane season.  They will participate in a meet-and-great with first responders in Corpus Christi and then travel to Rockport to meet with a family whose home was destroyed in the hurricane.
Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence will also visit a local elementary school to speak with faculty and students about the hurricane.  And their last stop will be at a local food bank to meet with volunteers and help sort boxes for donations.
Finally, I know there have been a lot of questions surrounding the President’s decision on Jerusalem.  Tomorrow, the President will deliver remarks regarding this action.
At 5:30 this evening, senior administration officials will hold a background briefing here to explain the President’s decision.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  As you all know, the Constitution states that the President “shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend [to] their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”
With that in mind, we’re pleased to announce that the President has accepted the Speaker’s invitation to deliver the State of the Union Address on January 30th.
As you all know, the holiday season is in full swing here at the White House, with Thanksgiving having just passed and Christmas on the horizon.  We’ve also just survived Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the biggest shopping days of the year.
But right in the middle of all of this is another important day that deserves attention.  Earlier this week was the 6th annual Giving Tuesday.  Giving Tuesday was created in 2012 to celebrate and support philanthropy.  It’s a great reminder each year that we have the opportunity and the duty to give back to the people, the institutions to the country that has given us all so much.
As the Gospel of Luke says, “From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.”  Americans understand this.  Year after year, the United States ranks at or near the top of the World Giving Index, which ranks countries according to how charitable their people are.
In a statement earlier this week, the President encouraged people all over the country to open up their hearts and their pocketbooks to support worthy causes.  This Giving Tuesday, he said, “I thank those who have contributed to charitable organizations, including our houses of worship, and ask that we continue to come together to give and help others in need, especially to communities devastated by the recent natural disasters.  Together we can ensure that the blessings of this holiday season are shared around the world.”
The President is leading by example on this.  As you’re aware, he donates his full presidential salary on a quarterly basis.  He donated his first-quarter salary to fund restoration projects at the [Antietam] National Battlefield.  In the second quarter, he donated his salary to the Department of Education so they could host science, technology, engineering, and math camps for children.
And today, I have Acting Secretary Hargan from HHS to make an announcement regarding what the President will be doing with his third-quarter salary.
So, with that, I’d like to bring up the Acting Secretary.  And before I wrap up, I just want to say how much we look forward to hosting everybody tomorrow.  And I will be back up, after the Acting Secretary makes remarks about what the donation is for, to take questions on other topics.  So with that, I’ll turn it over to the Acting Secretary and be back up.
Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
ACTING SECRETARY HARGAN:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Thanks, Sarah.  So thank you, Sarah, for that.  And good afternoon everyone.
As Sarah said, I’m the Acting Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, known as HHS.  HHS is home not just to programs like Medicare and Medicaid, but also to the National Institutes of Health, NIH; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, known as CDC; Food and Drug Administration, FDA; and the federal government’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Agency, known as SAMHSA.
That’s a lot of acronyms, so sorry about that.  But I want you to know what HHS does because I’m here to talk about the check that I was just given, written by President Trump to HHS using his third-quarter salary.  His decision to donate his salary is a tribute to his compassion, to his patriotism, and a sense of duty to the American people.  But it’s his compassion, above all, that drives his interest in the issue to which HHS is going to devote his donation:  America’s devastating opioid crisis.
Since day one of this administration, President Trump’s leadership on this issue has driven action on it across the federal government.  Speaking for HHS in particular, earlier this year, we unveiled a comprehensive strategy that attacks the opioid epidemic on five fronts.  The five points are: better data on the epidemic; better research into pain and addiction; better pain management; better targeting of overdose-reversing drugs; and better prevention, treatment, and recovery services.
This strategy devotes HHS’s unique resources and expertise to empowering heroes on the frontlines of this crisis.  Because after all, it’s our local partners in community clinics, churches, law enforcement, schools, and state, local, and tribal governments who ultimately are going to turn the tide on this epidemic.  They are fighting each day, face to face, with a drug crisis that is killing more than 175 Americans every day.
Just think about that for a second.  That means we’ll lose seven of our fellow Americans to drug overdoses during this press briefing alone.
That kind of urgency is why President Trump delivered a speech back in October calling for HHS to declare an unprecedented nationwide public health emergency regarding the crisis.
After we did so, we’ve continued to take aggressive action at our department, including approving state waivers to expand addiction treatment, and clarifying that doctors and hospitals can share information with the patient’s loved ones in dangerous situations like drug overdoses.
Now, I got to meet some of the local heroes that we’re working to empower just a few weeks ago when I traveled to Kentucky the day after the President’s speech.  We visited a clinic in Lexington that treats young mothers struggling with opioid addiction and their babies who are sometimes born physically dependent on opioids themselves.
The stories we heard in Lexington hit close to home for me, personally, because I’m from a small town in southern Illinois, the kind of rural community that’s been hit hard by this epidemic.  It’s also the kind of community that President Trump has spent a lot of time in over the past couple of years where he’s heard about how Americans are suffering.
Part of the way we aim to stop this crisis is by raising awareness of how devastating and deadly drug addiction can be.  That’s why we’re so pleased that President Trump has chosen to donate his salary this quarter to the planning and design of a large-scale public awareness campaign about the dangers of opioid addiction.
And HHS is proud to be working with the White House on this effort.  And our team of public health experts brings a great deal of experience and expertise to the table regarding how to make these campaigns effective.
At HHS, our goal is to create healthier lives, stronger communities, and a safer country.  And we’re glad to have a President who recognizes that the opioid crisis is a huge threat to all three of these goals.
The President is personally dedicated to defeating this crisis because addiction hits home for so many of us.  You heard him share the story in his opioid speech about how he lost his own brother to alcoholism.  And speaking personally, opioid addiction has been a presence in my hometown, in my family, for years.  It was years ago, in fact, that I lost a close relative who constantly struggled with opioids.
So, this Christmas and holiday season, all of us should consider following the President’s example and think about what we can do in our own private lives to help fight back against a crisis that’s tearing American families apart.  We all know people that are hurting this holiday season, and I know that we, as Americans, will rise to their aid.
So thanks again for having me here today, and thanks once again to President Trump for his generous donation.
MS. SANDERS:  Thank you, Acting Secretary Hargan.  I appreciate you being here today on behalf of the department.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-113017/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Hope everyone had a happy Thanksgiving and took the opportunity to enjoy some downtime with your friends and family.
As you all can see, we’re quickly transitioning from Thanksgiving to the Christmas season here at the White House.  This morning, the First Lady unveiled this year’s decorations, and she personally selected and was involved in every detail.
The theme, “Time-Honored Traditions,” was designed by Mrs. Trump to pay respect to 200 years of holiday traditions at the White House.  During the month of December, the White House will host more than 100 open houses and numerous receptions, and more than 25,000 visitors will walk the halls taking part in public tours.
Speaking of Christmas, the President is looking forward to the Senate bringing us another step closer to delivering a big, beautiful Christmas present to the American people in the form of massive tax relief.  To that end, on Wednesday, the President will travel to St. Charles, Missouri to deliver an important address to the nation on the need for tax cuts and reforms.
Unemployment is already at a 17-year low, wages are starting to raise, the stock market continues to hit all-time highs, and optimism is through the roof.  Just imagine what’s going to be possible when this plan passes.  And I think it will be a great lead-in to the Christmas season and something we can all be excited about.
And with that, I will take your questions.

5135,Trump,2017-11-17 10:00:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Yesterday, momentum continued to build behind our plan to deliver massive tax relief and job creation for the American people.  The House passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the Senate Finance Committee passed its companion tax reform bill.  These were important moments as we move closer to a final vote.
In recent months, we’ve heard from American entrepreneurs, workers, and families from every corner of our nation about how this plan will empower them to build a better life.
In Pennsylvania, Susie Schlomann said that our plan will be “incredible for me and other fixed-income retirees,” because tax relief is targeted at the middle class.
In Ohio, Kristina Port — a small business owner who raised twins as a single mother while launching her company — said the increase in the child tax credit would help working mothers.  She also said simplifying the complex tax code would ease the burden on entrepreneurs and allow them to devote more of their time to growing their business, rather than wrestling with their taxes.
In state after state, story after story, we’ve heard how our plan will profoundly improve the lives of hardworking Americans.  The optimism is coming back, because with this tax plan — combined with the President’s efforts to eliminate job-killing regulations — Americans feel like their goals are once again attainable.
It’s a reminder of one of the things that made our country unique to begin with.  Our people have always been able to visualize a future for themselves and their children and make it a reality.  That’s why it’s called the “American Dream,” and this tax plan will make it more attainable for more of our people than ever before.
But for this to happen, we need economic growth that makes it possible for businesses to create jobs and raise wages.  So to give some perspective on how our tax plan is going to do that, I’ve invited Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to join us in the briefing today.  Kevin will say a few words and then take some questions specific to this topic.  And, as always, I will come back up to take the rest of your questions after that, which I’m sure will all be on tax reform.  (Laughter.)
So, with that, I’ll turn it over to Kevin.
MR. HASSETT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Thanks.  And it’s a pleasure to be here to see so many familiar faces.  You know, last week I had the honor of chairing the Economic Policy Committee meeting at the OECD in Paris.  And the Economic Policy Committee is one of the oldest committees in OECD, and it brings together people, like the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, from countries around the OECD.
And, at the meeting, they were going through the staff recommendations of the OECD for creating economic growth in countries around the world.  And the three main points of the staff recommendations were tax reform, infrastructure, and deregulation — that if the government pursues those things, then they can produce more economic growth.
In fact, there was widespread acclaim for the President’s approach towards corporate taxation in particular, because the OECD has been calling for us to reform our corporate tax code for almost a decade.
And so the idea right now that this corporate tax reform is close to the finish line is celebrated not only by us at the White House, but by people around the world who have recognized that us having a non-competitive tax code, the highest corporate tax on Earth, a worldwide system that rewards companies for locating activity elsewhere, is bad not only for us but for the world economy — because a vibrant U.S. economy is good even for our friends in the OECD.
And, with that, I’m pleased to see that the House Ways and Means Committee and then the House have passed this bill, and that it’s out of the Finance Committee — I look forward to the Senate moving forward right after the Thanksgiving break.
And, I guess, I promised — I’m not good at this.  I don’t know what the protocol is, but I’ll start in the front row and then work back.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-111717/

Beijing, China
3:21 P.M. CST
SECRETARY TILLERSON: It is a pleasure to be back in Beijing. As you know, this is the third stop of the President’s lengthy trip. So we’re kind of at the halfway mark — great meetings in Japan, South Korea — good capstone to it all here in Beijing. And then of course we’ll head on for the rest of the trip.
I know President Trump has been very gratified, and you’ve heard him express that himself with the warm welcome he’s received here in China. He and President Xi continue to build a personal relationship that’s defined by deep respect for each other, a frank, open, and productive exchange.
Also, I want to thank Ambassador Terry Branstad for the outstanding job he’s doing. The Ambassador and his team have been working hard to ensure a successful visit for our President. And I also want to reiterate my appreciation for all the hard work our folks at the embassy here in Beijing do implementing our policy here on the ground.
Our two Presidents have had a candid and constructive set of conversations about issues of shared interest and concern. They agreed that we need to work together to expand areas of cooperation and generate positive outcomes for the benefit of both of our citizens. Our President has affirmed that by directly and frankly addressing these issues where we have differences, we can find ways to solve problems.
The key topic of discussion was our continued joint effort to increase pressure on North Korea, to convince them to abandon their nuclear and missile program. President Trump and President Xi affirmed their commitment to achieve a complete, verifiable, and permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. President Trump and President Xi will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea.
We’re grateful for China’s cooperation. President Trump has made clear the need to not just maintain the current peaceful pressure efforts, but to do even more.
We also had a candid conversation about our economic relationship. President Trump called for China to give fair and reciprocal treatment to U.S. companies and exports to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and rebalance the economic relationship.
On critical issue of opioids, we’ve made some good progress on actions to curb the flow the harmful narcotics into the United States in order to save American lives. The President committed to take new actions, including agreements to control the export of new fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information packages to identify individuals and criminal networks responsible for trafficking.
This is my third trip to China, as many of you know, since I became Secretary of State. And I know that Defense Secretary Mattis is planning to come early in 2018. This underscores the importance we place on the diplomatic and security relationship that he and I have developed jointly. In addition to engaging on today’s most pressing issues, we’re also discussing ways to prevent mishaps, misunderstandings, and miscalculations.
We’ve also discussed our respective positions on cyberspace, outer space, and nonproliferation. We plan on continuing our engagement in these and other areas over the coming year.
As you know, we’ll next be going to Vietnam for the APEC Summit and then on to Manila for ASEAN and the East Asia Summit. We had a frank exchange here, in China, on maritime security issues and the South China Sea. The U.S. position remains unchanged: We insist on upholding freedom of navigation that claims to be consistent with international law, and that claimants should stop construction and militarization of outposts in order to maximize prospects for successful diplomacy.
The President also committed to promote exchanges and understanding between our peoples, and had a frank exchange of views on human rights issues.
On behalf of the United States, I repeat our gratitude to China for hosting President Trump and our entire U.S. government delegation.
And I’m happy to take questions, and I think Sarah is going to referee for me because she’s better at that than I am.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-state-rex-tillerson-110917/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I know you guys are probably very sad since we’re not going to get a lot of days like this together over the next couple of weeks since we’ll be traveling. But for those of you on the trip, I look forward to seeing you. For those of you that aren’t, we’re going to certainly miss all of you and your questions.
It’s a busy day here at the White House, like most days here. As you all saw, the President was excited to announce that Broadcom Limited is coming back to the United States, moving their company back here from Singapore. Their CEO credited the President’s economic agenda for once again making the United States the best place in the world to grow a business.
He also noted that the tax reform plan, which was rolled out this morning, will make it easier for them and other companies to do exactly what the President has promised: bring back our jobs, bring back our wealth, and bring back our great American dreams.
This morning, the President applauded the House Ways and Means Committee for introducing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is another important step toward providing massive tax relief for the American people. Our entire administration is working tirelessly to make good on our promise to the working people who built our nation to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms — the rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before.
Now, as you all know, the President is preparing to leave the country tomorrow for a five-country, ten-day trip to Hawaii and Asia. This afternoon, we have with us the President’s National Security Advisor, General McMaster, who will preview the trip and take some of your questions.
Please keep your questions on topic. If you have other questions, the press team will be around this afternoon and throughout the next 10 days while the rest of us are on the road. Thanks so much.
General McMaster.
GENERAL MCMASTER: Thank you.
Well, good afternoon everyone. Good to see everybody. Tomorrow, President Trump embarks on his longest foreign trip to date and the longest trip to Asia by an American President in more than a quarter century.
This trip is a great opportunity to demonstrate America’s and the Trump administration’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific and our efforts to strengthen longstanding American alliances and expand new partnerships. The President has actively engaged leaders in the Indo-Pacific this year to address a range of strategic issues, including, most notably, the North Korean nuclear threat.
Since taking office, President Trump has placed 43 calls to Indo-Pacific leaders and conducted bilateral meetings with Japan, South Korea, China, India, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. This historic trip will build on that ongoing diplomacy.
The President’s trip will focus on three goals: First, strengthening international resolve to denuclearize North Korea. Second, promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Third, advance American prosperity through fair and reciprocal trade and economic practices.
The United States remains committed to the complete, verifiable, and permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. President Trump will reiterate the plain fact that North Korea threatens not just our allies, South Korea and Japan, and the United States — North Korea is a threat to the entire world. So all nations of the world must do more to counter that threat.
That is happening, but the President recognizes that we’re running out of time and we’ll ask all nations to do more. In particular, the President will continue to call on all responsible nations, especially those with the most influence over North Korea, to isolate the North Korean regime economically and politically; to convince its leaders that the pursuit of nuclear weapons is a dead end and that it is past time to denuclearize; and he will remind friend and foe alike that the United States stands ready to defend itself and our allies using the full range of our capabilities.
The President will also use his trip to promote his vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The President will make the case that respect for freedom of navigation and overflight, the rule of law, sovereignty, freedom from coercion, and private enterprise and open markets is the best model to increase prosperity throughout the region and to secure the freedom and independence of all nations.
And, of course, increasing prosperity of the American people is always one of President Trump’s top priorities. Throughout the trip the President will stress his commitment to free, fair, and reciprocal trade.
He looks forward to working with partners across the Indo-Pacific region to ensure that governments do not unfairly subsidize their industries, discriminate against foreign business, or restrict foreign investment. This will help increase trade, reduce unsustainable deficits and promote prosperity for the American people and the people of the Indo-Pacific region.
A final point, and a point that is often overlooked, this trip, like all the President’s engagements with foreign leaders, builds on previous accomplishments and our previous diplomatic efforts.
One example I’ll provide is that, in Riyadh, in May, President Trump delivered a historic speech to the leaders of more than 50 Muslim-majority nations. The President will interact with many of those same leaders at APEC or ASEAN — both of those conferences.
He will reiterate three key U.S. counterterrorism pillars that he unveiled in that speech in Riyadh. First, deny terrorists safe havens and support bases. Second, cut off their funding. And third, discredit their wicked ideology.
I think it’s time for us to recognize that there’s been significant progress on all three fronts. Raqqa and Mosul have been liberated and will soon no longer control territory and populations, as the United States has worked very hard with allies and partners to deny that safe haven and support base — in this case, to ISIS.
Second, we should recognize that there’s been considerable progress on terrorist financing. As you saw, Secretary Mnuchin’s visit to the region last week, during which he opened the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center.
And then also, you’ve heard a lot of leaders, across the world, and the President, foremost among them, discrediting this ideology — this Islamist or Takfiri or Salafi-Jihadist ideology. And last week, I think it’s worth reading, the Saudi Crown Prince’s speech, during which he called for a return to moderate Islam.
At the ASEAN 50th birthday party in Manila, the President will discuss how to strengthen partnerships across the Indo-Pacific to further efforts against transnational terrorist organizations.
So this trip is an opportunity to build momentum toward shared prosperity and security, and I’m happy to take your questions. Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-110217/

3:15 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Let me just start by offering our thoughts and prayers today with the people of New York City — some of the toughest, most resilient people on Earth — in the wake of yesterday’s cowardly terrorist attack.
This attack underscores that the terrorist threat is real. And as we defeat ISIS and affiliated groups abroad, we must be vigilant here in our country as they seek other ways to attack the homeland. Inspiring such attacks through hateful propaganda has always been part of ISIS’s and other terrorists’ strategy.
This underscores the need for the most careful vetting of who enters our country. There are hundreds of active law enforcement investigations into foreign nationals suspected of engaging in terrorism, and we must vet those seeking entry to the United States thoroughly.
Last night, just hours after the attack, a million New Yorkers, including families with their children, marched through the city for a Halloween parade. Their message was heard loud and clear: The American spirit will never be broken. Those who hope we will succumb to fear will never get what they want. And those who seek to divide us will only bring us closer together.
In the midst of the attack, New York City’s finest — our incredible police and first responders — rushed to the aid of their fellow citizens. They did their duty, they ran into danger so that others could run away to safety, and they performed like the heroes they were born to be.
Specifically, Officer Ryan Nash, a five-year veteran of the NYPD, was among the first to respond to the scene, and fired the shot that stopped the attacker from continuing the violence.
He’s a hero, but that doesn’t come as a surprise to most of his colleagues. He’s already received two awards during his young career — one for Excellent Police Duty and another for other police action. Yesterday, he earned something that could never be properly displayed by a ribbon or medal; he earned the never-ending thanks of a grateful nation.
The President has vowed to defend our country, protect our communities, and put the safety of Americans first. This is the oath he took as President, and that is his sacred pledge to the citizens of our country.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

1:33 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I’d like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic that I know all of you are preparing to ask me about, and that’s tax reform. (Laughter.) A couple of you got it.
The initial House tax reform bill will be introduced on Wednesday by the Ways & Means Committee. This is the product of months of work and is now going through an open process in the House.
The committee plans to mark up the bill next week, starting on Monday. The House is likely to consider the bill week of November 13th. In order to stay on pace, we want to see a House bill passed by Thanksgiving. This is a very aggressive timeline, but one that will help us get tax cuts this year so families and businesses can plan for 2018.
We look forward to the details of the tax bill being released on Wednesday, but today I want to take a step back and explain what we’re working to do using an anecdote we can all understand.
This story has been floating around the Internet for a while, and it’s important to keep in mind that the numbers are not exact, and I’m also not encouraging any drinking. So file that away -– it’s mostly for my parents. But I think you’ll enjoy it.
Suppose that every day, 10 people –- for our purposes, we’ll say reporters -– go out for beer, and the bill for all 10 comes to $100. If these 10 reporters paid their tab every night the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:
first four, the poorest, would pay nothing. The fifth would pay $1. The sixth would pay $3. The seventh would pay $7. The eighth would pay $12. The ninth would pay $18. The tenth, the richest, would pay $59. So that’s what they decided to do.
The 10 reporters drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the bar owner threw them a curveball. “Since you’re all such good customers,” he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.” Drinks for the 10 reporters would now cost just $80.
The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four were unaffected; they would still drink for free. But what about the other six? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get their fair share? These are the reporters after all, so they’re concerned with fairness.
They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody’s share, then the fifth reporter and the sixth reporter would each end up being paid to drink beer.
So the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man’s bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was. By doing that, he explained, they’d continue following the principle of the tax system they’d been using. So he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should pay now.
And so the fifth reporter, like the first four, now paid nothing. He got a 100 percent saving. The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3, a 33 percent saving. The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7, a 28 percent saving. The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12, a 25 percent saving. The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18, which was a 22 percent saving. And the tenth now paid $49 instead of $59, a 16 percent saving.
So each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the bar, the reporters began to compare their savings. “I only got a dollar out of the $20 saving,” declared the sixth reporter.
And she pointed to the tenth reporter, “he got $10.”
“Yes, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth reporter. “I only saved a dollar too. It’s unfair that he received ten times more benefit than me!”
“That’s true!” shouted the seventh reporter. “Why should he get $10 back, when I got only $2? The wealthy gets all the breaks.”
“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four reporters in unison, “we didn’t get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!”
The nine reporters yelled at the tenth and made him feel bad.
So the next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, and the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They no longer had enough money between them all to even cover half of the bill.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally benefit from a tax reduction, but not the largest percent benefit. Taxing them too much — attack them — and they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.
This is a silly story, of course, but it illustrates some very important points. Our tax cuts and reforms will create a fairer system that works better for everyone. And it will make our country the friendliest in the world for American families trying to build a better life for themselves and their children, and for American companies seeking a competitive edge.
And I’ll be happy to get that story to everybody so that you can get those numbers later. Again, I know that that may be an oversimplification, but I think it paints a very good picture of the tax system.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-103017/

MS. SANDERS: Catch you off guard when we’re on time. Good afternoon.
As you all saw, earlier today the President met with the Governor of Puerto Rico this morning to discuss the ongoing hurricane recovery efforts. The administration is working tirelessly to help our fellow citizens recover and rebuild, and we will stand with them throughout this process.
It’s been a while since I’ve had the opportunity to share a letter to the President from the podium, and I have one today that I think you’ll all enjoy.
This one is from Mackenzie of Dalton, Georgia. Mackenzie is seven years old and is in the second grade. And she wrote:
“Dear President Trump, I’m writing to tell you how much I appreciate all you’re doing. I think you’re an awesome President. In fact, I voted for you in my school election. My mom is bringing me to D.C. on spring break this year, and I’m very excited. I’ve never been there before, and I can’t wait to see everything.
I am most excited to see the White House. My mom said we have to write someone to ask to come in, and I hope we can. I know you’re a busy man, but if you could meet me, or at least see your office, it would make my day. And I would love to shake your hand.
You’re our leader, a hero, and a great man, and I can’t wait to see you and help make America great again. Sincerely, Mackenzie, you’re biggest fan.
P.S. If you would like, I can bring something to eat when I come. I’ve always heard food brings people together.”
Well, Mackenzie, I had the opportunity to share your letter with the President earlier today, and he said he would love for you to come and visit us here at the White House during spring break. I’ll give you a tour personally, and if the President is here, he’d love to meet you as well.
Finally, you’re very right about food bringing people together, and so the press staff would like to invite you to have lunch here in the Navy Mess downstairs in the West Wing. We look very much forward to your visit and hope that you’ll be in touch so that we can make sure that that happens.
On a more serious note, we’ve had a lot of questions come in, and I certainly addressed quite a few of them yesterday, and thought today it might be more appropriate to have the Chief of Staff address some of those questions specific to outreach to Gold Star families. He’ll address questions on that topic, and if you have other questions throughout the day, the press staff will be here and happy to answer those after the briefing later this afternoon.
Thanks, guys.
GENERAL KELLY: Well, thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note, so I just wanted to perhaps make more of a statement than an — give more of an explanation in what amounts to be a traditional press interaction.
Most Americans don’t know what happens when we lose one of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, our Coast Guardsmen in combat. So let me tell you what happens:
Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud, puts them on a helicopter as a routine, and sends them home. Their first stop along the way is when they’re packed in ice, typically at the airhead. And then they’re flown to, usually, Europe where they’re then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the medals that they’ve earned, the emblems of their service, and then puts them on another airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort that takes them home.
A very, very good movie to watch, if you haven’t ever seen it, is “Taking Chance,” where this is done in a movie — HBO setting. Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me, and it’s worth seeing that if you’ve never seen it.
So that’s the process. While that’s happening, a casualty officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom and dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different places. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until — well, for a long, long time, even after the internment. So that’s what happens.
are these young men and women? They are the best 1 percent this country produces. Most of you, as Americans, don’t know them. Many of you don’t know anyone who knows any one of them. But they are the very best this country produces, and they volunteer to protect our country when there’s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate, but required. But that’s all right.
Who writes letters to the families? Typically, the company commander — in my case, as a Marine — the company commander, battalion commander, regimental commander, division commander, Secretary of Defense, typically the service chief, commandant of the Marine Corps, and the President typically writes a letter.
Typically, the only phone calls a family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies. In my case, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan, telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really mattered.
And yeah, the letters count, to a degree, but there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.
So some Presidents have elected to call. All Presidents, I believe, have elected to send letters. If you elect to call a family like this, it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. There’s no perfect way to make that phone call.
When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, my first recommendation was he not do it because it’s not the phone call that parents, family members are looking forward to. It’s nice to do, in my opinion, in any event.
He asked me about previous Presidents, and I said, I can tell you that President Obama, who was my Commander-in-Chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family. That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say, I don’t believe President Obama called. That’s not a negative thing. I don’t believe President Bush called in all cases. I don’t believe any President, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high — that Presidents call. But I believe they all write.
So when I gave that explanation to our President three days ago, he elected to make phone calls in the cases of four young men who we lost in Niger at the earlier part of this month. But then he said, how do you make these calls? If you’re not in the family, if you’ve never worn the uniform, if you’ve never been in combat, you can’t even imagine how to make that call. I think he very bravely does make those calls.
The call in question that he made yesterday — or day before yesterday now — were to four family members, the four fallen. And remember, there’s a next-of-kin designated by the individual. If he’s married, that’s typically the spouse. If he’s not married, that’s typically the parents unless the parents are divorced, and then he selects one of them. If he didn’t get along with his parents, he’ll select a sibling. But the point is, the phone call is made to the next-of-kin only if the next-of-kin agrees to take the phone call. Sometimes they don’t.
So a pre-call is made: The President of the United States or the commandant of the Marine Corps, or someone would like to call, will you accept the call? And typically, they all accept the call.
So he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could. And he said to me, what do I say? I said to him, sir, there’s nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families.
Well, let me tell you what I told him. Let me tell you what my best friend, Joe Dunford, told me — because he was my casualty officer. He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we’re at war. And when he died, in the four cases we’re talking about, Niger, and my son’s case in Afghanistan — when he died, he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.
That’s what the President tried to say to four families the other day. I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, and broken-hearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing. A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion — that he’s a brave man, a fallen hero, he knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. There’s no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be, with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.
That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted.
It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life — the dignity of life — is sacred. That’s gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well.
Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. But I just thought — the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred.
And when I listened to this woman and what she was saying, and what she was doing on TV, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth. And you can always find them because they’re in Arlington National Cemetery. I went over there for an hour-and-a-half, walked among the stones, some of whom I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.
I’ll end with this: In October — April, rather, of 2015, I was still on active duty, and I went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami. And it was dedicated to two men who were killed in a firefight in Miami against drug traffickers in 1986 — a guy by the name of Grogan and Duke. Grogan almost retired, 53 years old; Duke, I think less than a year on the job. Anyways, they got in a gunfight and they were killed. Three other FBI agents were there, were wounded, and now retired. So we go down — Jim Comey gave an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to those fallen men and to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve our country so well, and law enforcement so well.
There were family members there. Some of the children that were there were three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their lives.
And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money — the $20 million — to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned. Stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.
But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said, okay, fine.
So I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America, that let’s not let this maybe last thing that’s held sacred in our society — a young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country — let’s try to somehow keep that sacred. But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.
So I’m willing to take a question or two on this topic. Let me ask you this: Is anyone here a Gold Star parent or sibling? Does anyone here know a Gold Star parent or sibling?
Okay, you get the question.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-chief-staff-general-john-kelly-101917/

MS. SANDERS: Good Afternoon. I know it’s been a few days since I’ve been up here. I’m sure that you have all missed me as much as I’ve missed you.
As many of you will recall, one of President Trump’s core campaign promises was to defeat ISIS. With the stunning fall of Mosul in June, and now with ISIS nearly eradicated from Raqqa, it is clear that ISIS’s so-called caliphate is crumbling across Iraq and Syria.
This eminent victory by the global coalition and our brave servicemembers comes at a high cost, particularly to the Syrian Democratic Forces who suffered many casualties as they fought to liberate their own country from the oppression of ISIS.
of caring for the urgent humanitarian needs of Raqqa’s residents, ISIS utilized the money it stockpiled to finance terrorist attacks across the world, including against many Muslims.
As coalition and our partner forces closed in around them, ISIS used civilians as human shields and killed those who attempted to flee. ISIS’s barbaric acts have left many scars across the region, and we remain committed to supporting stabilization efforts and local security forces in liberated areas through a political transition in Syria.
Unfortunately, the Syrian regime and its supporters hinder the efforts to liberate Raqqa. Instead of focusing on fighting ISIS, the pro-regime forces attacked our partners and attempted to block them from liberating the Syrian people from the brutality of ISIS.
While we know ISIS and its destructive ideology will remain a threat, the liberation of Raqqa will mark the beginning of a new phase in the Syrian conflict. As we and our partners take away the ability of ISIS to plot and carry out attacks from territory they control, we will continue to seek the de-escalation of violence in other battlefields across Syria.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, we will be welcoming Governor Rosselló of Puerto Rico to the White House to talk about the ongoing recovery and rebuilding efforts. We will continue working hand-in-hand with local leaders in all areas of our country that have been impacted by several natural disasters in recent months. And as President Trump has repeatedly said, we stand with our fellow citizens; we’re here to help and get them back on their feet.
And with that, I will take your questions. Quiet.
John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-101817/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. We’ll jump right in. I’ve got a couple of brief announcements.
Today at 5:45 p.m., the White House will hold a background briefing for reporters regarding the administration’s Iran strategy. Then at 12:45 tomorrow, the President will deliver remarks announcing the strategy to the country.
Further details on both of those events will be forthcoming. Until then, I know you guys have lots of questions, and although I really enjoy answering them every single day, especially your more serious policy-focused questions that we tend to ask in here, I thought it would be nice since we’re at the White House and we have the option of calling in the Marines, that today we might call in one of our favorites, General Kelly.
So with that, I’m going to turn it over to the Chief of Staff and let him make some opening comments and answer your questions today. And after he concludes, of course, our team will be around later this afternoon to answer any further questions.
Thanks, guys.
GENERAL KELLY: Well, good afternoon. Great to be here. A couple of comments, I guess, and then open it up for Q&A.
I would have to tell you that coming into the job as the Chief of Staff, I had decided to not do too much with the press until I get my feet on the ground and figured out what base I was on on in any given day.
Prior to this, when I was at DHS and certainly as a Marine general officer, I interacted with the press a great deal. But coming into this job, I really needed to get to know the lay of the land.
I have done, I think, three off-the-records, the first one of which was, of course, violated. But thank you for all of you that didn’t violate the trust from those off-the-record periods.
I would just offer to you that although I read it all the time pretty consistently, I’m not quitting today. (Laughter.) I don’t believe — and I just talked to the President — I don’t think I’m being fired today. (Laughter.) And I’m not so frustrated in this job that I’m thinking of leaving.
I will tell you, this is the hardest job I’ve ever had. This is, in my view, the most important job I ever had. I would offer, though, it is not the best job I ever had. The best job I ever had, as I’ve said many times, is when I was an enlisted Marine sergeant infantryman. That was the best job I ever had.
So unless things change, I’m not quitting, I’m not getting fired, and I don’t think I’ll fire anyone tomorrow. (Laughter.)
So with that, John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-chief-staff-general-john-kelly-101217/

2:14 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I hope everybody had a nice Columbus Day. Got to take a little break. I’m sure you missed me.
Let me start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of California who are enduring the wildfires taking place now. The loss of homes and burning of precious land is heartbreaking, but the loss of life is truly devastating.
Last night, the President spoke with Governor Jerry Brown, and today he approved an expedited major disaster declaration for California, along with Fire Management Assistance Grants.
The administration is working closely with state and local officials to ensure the people of California are receiving the support they need.
Staying on the disaster relief front, I’d like to share some positive news from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands today. School resumed in the U.S. Virgin Islands this week. Seven schools opened today, powered by generators, and 11 more are scheduled to open next week.
Additionally, in Puerto Rico, FEMA is hosting a jobs fair to hire 1,200 Puerto Ricans to help with the relief efforts and boost the local economy.
The road to recovery is long, and there is so much work left to do, but the resilience of the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands continues to inspire us all. We will be with them throughout this entire process, and we are confident they will come back stronger than ever before.
Over the weekend, we released the President’s three primary immigration policy objectives, which should be included in any immigration legislation Congress considers.
The President has presented commonsense immigration reforms with broad bipartisan support that finally puts hardworking Americans first. According to a recent poll, over 70 percent of the American people support more ICE officers and strengthening penalties against illegal immigrants who are repeat violators of our laws. Two in three Americans implement a merit-based immigration system that looks out for working-class Americans — ideas that even Bernie Sanders has supported in the past.
The President’s priorities also include a southern border wall like what the Democrats voted for in the 2006 Secure Fences Act. These are not radical proposals. Many have gotten bipartisan support in the past. The Trump administration is ready to work with Congress to achieve these policy objectives and to ensure safe and lawful admissions, defend the safety and security of our country, and protect American workers and taxpayers.
Today, the First Lady flew to West Virginia to visit Lily’s Place, the nation’s first nonprofit infant recovery center that also provides services to parents and families dealing with addiction. Lily’s House treats infants for neonatal abstinence syndrome, which occurs when a baby withdraws from drugs he or she was exposed to in the womb before birth.
According to the Governor Accountability Office, an American baby is born with NAS every 25 minutes, and 40 percent of babies born addicted to opioids go into the foster system. Each situation is a tragedy, and the First Lady is doing incredible work to raise awareness about this important issue.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, the President will continue his push to provide tax relief to hardworking Americans. He’ll be traveling to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to deliver remarks. In attendance at the event will be hundreds of truckers. They keep our economy moving, literally, and they are excited about the President’s tax reform plan, which will create more jobs and empower workers and families to keep more of their hard-earned money.
Before I take your questions, I’d like to offer an invitation to all of the White House Press Corps, on behalf of the President and the First Lady and the administration, to bring your children to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on October 27th to celebrate Halloween, where there will be lots of fun, and I’m sure lots of candy so we can sugar your kids up and send them back home to you. (Laughter.)
And with that, I’ll take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-101017/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. We’re still working on that I see. We’ll get better.
Yesterday, three U.S. servicemembers and one partner nation member were killed while providing assistance to counterterror operations. As many of you are aware, U.S. forces are in the country to provide training and security assistance to the local armed forces in their efforts to counter violent extremist organizations. Additionally, two U.S. servicemembers were injured and evacuated in stable condition to Germany.
are being withheld at this time as part of the next of kin notification process. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the fallen servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of the freedoms we hold so dear.
The President also visited Las Vegas yesterday to offer his support to the incredible people there. He met with law enforcement, first responders, the medical trauma teams, all of whom did incredible work under dire circumstances, and visited with survivors and their families.
The President was deeply touched by the spirit of the people in Las Vegas. In one particularly stirring moment at the hospital, the President met 28-year-old Thomas Gunderson, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the leg. After being shot, Thomas dragged himself behind a row of bleachers and began worrying that he may bleed out. But two young women rushed to his side. One tied a belt around his leg to stop the bleeding, and others rallied a group of men to carry him to safety.
He suffered a torn muscle in his calf, making it difficult to stand. But when the President and the First Lady walked into his room at the hospital, he endured the pain and rose to his feet. When asked why he did it, Thomas said, “I will never lie down when the President of this great country comes to shake my hand.”
The Las Vegas Strong hashtag that has swept across social media in recent days could not be more fitting.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, the Vice President will be traveling to Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. He will meet with survivors, local officials, and first responders, and personally assess the massive recovery efforts.
The federal government continues to provide much-needed personnel and and supplies to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico’s governor recently said, “The President and the administration, every time we’ve asked them to execute, they’ve executed quickly.” That has been, and will continue to be, our goal.
This unprecedented relief effort should make it very clear we will not rest or stop until all of our people are safe, secure, and set on a clear path toward building the very bright future they deserve.
And with that, I will take your questions. Jill.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-100517/

MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. Our thoughts and prayers today are with the victims and survivors in Las Vegas, and with the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where massive storm recovery efforts are ongoing.
The President will be flying to Puerto Rico tomorrow to view the devastation, and he will assure the people there that we are with them 100 percent today and for the long haul. Puerto Ricans have shown incredible resilience, and we are fully committed to helping them rebuild their lives.
Last night, thousands of our fellow citizens endured what the President has rightly called an “act of pure evil” in Las Vegas. The President has ordered our flags to half-staff. And to further honor those lost in the attack, we will hold a moment of silence on the South Lawn this afternoon at 2:45 p.m. Eastern Time.
The President will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to grieve with the friends and family of the victims, to offer his support to those recovering from their wounds, and to thank the courageous first responders.
In the coming days, this attack will directly impact communities all over our country whose residents were visiting the entertainment capital of the world to attend a concert. One man, 29-year-old Sonny Melton, had traveled from Tennessee to Las Vegas for the concert with his wife, Heather. When the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers. They had been married for just over a year.
Others risked their own lives to save people that they had never met. Mike McGarry of Philadelphia laid on top of students at the concert to protect them from the gunfire. “They’re 20, I’m 53,” he said, “and I’ve lived a good life.”
Lindsay Padgett and her fiancé, Mike Jay, fled for cover during the attack, and immediately returned to the scene with their pick-up truck to help transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.
Gail Davis, who was attending the concert with her husband, said she owes her life to a brave police officer who instinctively served as a human shield, protecting her from harm.
Sadly, multiple police officers, both on duty and off duty, were among those killed or injured. But what these people did for each other says far more about who we are as Americans than the cowardly acts of a killer ever could.
The Gospel of John reminds us that there is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for a friend. The memory of those who displayed the ultimate expression of love in the midst of an unimaginable act of hate will never fade. Their examples will serve as an eternal reminder that the American spirit cannot and will not ever be broken. In the days ahead, we will grieve as a nation, we will honor the memory of those lost as a nation, and we will come together, united as one nation, under God, and indivisible.
And with that, I’ll take your questions. Major.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-100217/

2:45 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. I’d like to start by saying that the President and all of us at the White House were thrilled to see Congressman Scalise back on the House floor today. Our thoughts and prayers have been with him and his family for many weeks now, and we’ll continue to root for him as he works toward a full recovery.
Today, the President is actively engaged in monitoring the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. This morning he received an update from FEMA Administrator Brock Long. Administrator Long has also briefed members of the Senate this morning and members of the House this afternoon.
The full weight of the United States government is engaged to ensure that food, water, healthcare, and other lifesaving resources are making it to the people in need.
At the request of the governor, who is doing a terrific job, the President waived the Jones Act. This will ensure that ample resources are making it to the island, but we will continue to focus on the challenge of distributing those resources.
The island setting presents logistical hurdles that do not exist on the mainland where trucks from around the country can converge on disaster areas. Ten thousand federal government relief workers are there, including 7,200 troops are now on the island and working tirelessly to get people what they need.
We have prioritized lifesaving resources to hospitals and can report that 44 of the island’s 69 hospitals are now fully operational.
The Army Corps of Engineers is spearheading a massive mobilization to restore power, and this began with providing the diesel fuel necessary for sustainable emergency power generation. They’re also working to restore long-term power generation and distribution around the island.
There’s a long way to go, but we will not rest until everyone is safe and secure. Our message to the incredible people of Puerto Rico is this: The President is behind you. We all are — the entire country. Your unbreakable spirit is an inspiration to us all. We are praying for you, we are working for you, and we will not let you down.
As you all know, the President traveled to Indianapolis, Indiana yesterday to roll out a framework for delivering tax relief to hardworking Americans. Our framework is based on four key ideas:
First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans. Second, we will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand. Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. And finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
Robin Heldman owns a small printing and digital services business in Indianapolis. Robin and her husband, Roger, bought the business in 1991 and have since tripled in size. They both work full time in the shop and employ three additional people. As Robin describes it, her family is living the American Dream.
However, Robin feels small businesses in our country have been neglected and, in her words, “put on the backburner.” But she’s now excited about what the President and congressional leaders are proposing. She believes this tax cut will be a boom not just for her small business, but also for her customers. Robin relies on small businesses to take risk and make investments in marketing campaigns that require printing services. Robin is thrilled about the possibility of the tax code being simplified to allow the average taxpayer, such as herself, to save time and money, and that they can invest in their families and their business.
People like Robin are at the heart of the President’s tax relief plan. To talk more about the tax relief plan, I’d like to bring up NEC Director Gary Cohn. And after Gary takes a few of your questions, we’ll also have Tom Bossert up to answer some questions specific to the hurricane relief efforts, and then I’ll come up for more general — if you guys are insistent and have other topics you want to cover.
Thanks.
MR. COHN: Thanks, Sarah. I was going to make some opening remarks, but I think I won’t because you covered a few of them.
A couple things I will say is: The President has made his goals very clear what he wants to achieve here with tax reform and cutting taxes in the United States. I think you know where we are in the process. The Group of Six has been working really well together. We’re now in the hands of Congress. We want to go through a normal, regular process both in the Senate and the House, and we’re working well with both tax drafting committees. And the committees will continue to work, and they’re working really, really well and really quickly. And we’re trying to drive tax reform as quickly as we can.
I think you know the basic premise behind that. I’m not going to take you through what we’ve talked about before. Again, a question we get asked a lot, so I’ll say it right now: We have to make some basic assumptions right now on where we’re going to end up with the brackets. But I’ll tell you, based on our assumptions, a typical family earning $100,000 with two children that has been a standard deductor — who uses the standard deduction, continues to use the standard deduction — they can expect a tax cut of about $1,000. That’s where we’re headed, and that’s where we’re going to continue to be.
And with that, I think I’ll open it up to questions and see what’s on your mind. Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-092817/

MS. SANDERS: It’s another busy day here at the White House. On the economic front, this week, the President will continue his push to secure tax relief for hardworking American families.
We are pleased to announce that the President will be traveling to Indianapolis, Indiana on Wednesday. While there, he will deliver remarks on the historic tax cuts and reforms that he has been working on with members of Congress. During his remarks, the President will discuss new details on the framework for these cuts and reforms. These details will include specific proposed rates for individuals, small businesses, and corporations, and he will also discuss the elimination of loopholes that have rigged the current tax code in favor of the wealthy and well-connected.
As the President has said before, we will give our workers the level playing field they deserve and they will win — because if the fight is fair, no one on Earth can beat the American worker. These cuts and reforms will deliver massive job creation and economic growth, and we are confident the American people will be very excited about what we are proposing.
While working to grow the economy of today, the President will also sign a presidential memorandum to ensure that American children are empowered to succeed in the workforce of tomorrow. Technology is playing a growing role in our economy, and this means that technical knowledge and skills are more important than ever. But more than half of our schools do not currently offer courses in computer programming, and nearly 40 percent do not offer physics.
The memo the President will sign today directs Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to take several steps to address this issue for our students. First, it directs the Secretary to establish high-quality STEM education with a particular focus on computer science as one of the Department of Education’s priorities.
Second, it directs her to establish a goal of devoting at least $200 million per year in grant funds toward this priority.
Finally, the memo directs Secretary DeVos to explore administrative actions that increase the focus on computer science in existing K-12 and post-secondary programs.
This memorandum comes on the heels of the executive order the President signed in June to expand apprenticeships giving more Americans the opportunity to earn while they learn, and to receive skills training that will put them on the path to fulfilling work.
The President believes it’s our responsibility to give our students — especially underrepresented groups, minorities, and women, and those from rural communities — every opportunity to succeed. By signing this memorandum, he is taking action to ensure that they have access to the high-quality STEM education they deserve.
The timing of this memo, which will be so important to America’s underserved communities, is particularly fitting today. September 25th is the 60th anniversary of the Little Rock Nine’s first day of class at Central High School. A few weeks prior to their first day, Governor Orval Faubus called in the Arkansas National Guard to stand by as segregationists blocked the nine black students from entering the all-white school.
One of the nine students, Elizabeth Eckford, recalled — and I quote: “They moved closer and closer…Somebody started yelling…I tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the crowd — someone who could maybe help. I looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed like a kind face, but when I looked at her again, she spat on me.”
Twenty years ago today, as a new student at Central High myself, I watched President Bill Clinton and my dad, Governor Mike Huckabee, open the doors for the Little Rock Nine — the same doors that had been closed to them because they were black. The Little Rock Nine — Melba Beals, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Thelma Mothershed, Terrence Roberts, and the late Jefferson Thomas — are American heroes who courageously advanced racial equality.
As President Trump has said, racism is evil. It has no place in our country. Today, Central High is one of the most racially diverse and high-achieving schools in Arkansas. This is a testimony to how far we’ve come in the last 60 years.
It’s not lost on the President or his administration that there is more work to do. We need better schools and we need better jobs to provide a safer, stronger, more prosperous future for every American. President Trump is working to make America great again for all of our citizens, and his actions continue to show just how committed he is.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.
John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-092517/

4:37 P.M. EDT
AMBASSADOR HALEY: Good afternoon. Well, we have had a very productive and strong week at the U.N. You saw the United States had a very strong presence with the President, the Vice President, and many members of the national security team, as well as his economic team. The United States was out in full force, and I think the U.N. felt it, but I think it was extremely productive.
If you look at the beginning of the week, and we started with U.N. reform. You had the President and the Secretary General rolling out massive reforms for the U.N. What was extraordinary was we had 130 countries that have now signed on to that reform. That’s over two-thirds of the General Assembly, which is who is going to vote on this at the end. So that was a great start to the week.
Then you saw the President’s address to the General Assembly, and I think it showed the strength of the United States, but it also asked the world to come together and it asked all the countries to come together as we fight these rogue regimes, and mainly North Korea and Iran. And I think what you saw were a lot of countries responded, they were very positive to the speech, and they appreciated how blunt and honest he was. I think that’s been the overall theme from the international community this week, is how straightforward he was and how refreshing it was as they heard him speak.
We also today met with our allies, Japan and South Korea. Obviously a lot to talk about with North Korea. And so we had good conversations with them. And the President reassured, obviously, Japan and South Korea, but they also talked about strategies going forward for North Korea.
On Iran, that was a topic of conversation throughout the week. I think everyone was talking about the destabilizing activities that they can continue to do throughout the Middle East, whether it’s in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, and the list goes on. So it is something that we will continue to talk about and continue to move forward to make sure that we’re stopping any of their reckless behavior as well.
We also co-hosted a meeting with Secretary Boris Johnson, as well as the Dutch Foreign Minister, Bert Koenders, on human rights reform, and really talked about the fact that it needed to be representative of its name. We have a lot of bad actors on that council. Both the President and the Vice President spoke about it in their speeches, and the need to see better-quality countries that are on that council in order for it to be effective, and obviously for the United States to stay on it. If we don’t see changes in the Human Rights Council, we’ll continue to advocate for human rights, but we’ll do it on our own if we have to.
And then the Vice President attended a Security Council meeting yesterday on peacekeeping reform. We have made great progress these past several months in terms of reforming peacekeeping so that it’s actually going towards a political solution, it’s transparent, it’s accountable, but we’re also giving the troops the equipment they need and the ability to be trained in order to do their jobs. And so we’re just seeing smarter peacekeeping, and I think that all came together in the peacekeeping reform vote that we had yesterday.
One of the topics that everyone had to talk about this week and all had an opinion on was Burma. And as we’re dealing with the crisis in Burma and we’re seeing how much migration has taken place from the Rohingyas going out of Burma, every country is concerned. They’re concerned that the military continues to be aggressive, and they’re concerned that the government continues to be in denial. And so I think you’ll continue to see the international community talk about that. I think you will only see them get more active on that as we go forward.
And finally, today, the Security Council took a great step forward. It was a measure that I think the international community had been working on a long time, we certainly worked with our British friends on it — and that was ISIS accountability in Iraq. If you look at the fact that there have been massive — mass graves, there have been all types of terrible conducts to women and girls in those areas.
Whether it’s what’s happened with the Yezidis or the Christians or the Sunni and Shia Muslims, what we now have is a part of the U.N. body that’s going to be able to go in there and actually collect evidence and make sure that it can be used in trial so that the victims finally have their say and get their day in court, or at least their families do if they’ve lost loved ones. So that was a big day for the Security Council today.
And with that — there was obviously a lot more. I think the President met with multiple countries. There were lots of bilats. There was a lot of talk and planning and productivity. But overall, we can say it was a solid week at the U.N. this week, and it was highly successful.
But with that, I’ll answer any of your questions. Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-u-s-ambassador-u-n-nikki-haley-092117/

3:03 P.M. EDT
SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Hello, everybody. Nice to see you. Glad to be here with all of you. It’s been a very productive week at the United Nations. I’ve been pleased to be here with the President.
Today, the President strengthened — he signed an executive order that strengthened the U.S. government’s ability to cut off funding to the North Korean regime and its weapons development program. Despite multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un continues to threaten the world and his neighbors with provocative nuclear and missile tests.
President Trump’s new executive order significantly expands Treasury’s authorities to target those who enable this regime’s economic activity wherever they are located.
For too long, North Korea has evaded sanctions and used the international financial system to facilitate funding for its weapons and mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. No bank, in any country, should be used to facilitate Kim Jong-un’s destructive behavior.
This new executive order will authorize Treasury to impose a range of sanctions, such as suspending U.S. correspondent account access to any foreign bank that knowingly conducts or facilitates significant transactions tied to trade with North Korea. These sanctions will be forward-looking and applied to behavior that occurs following today, when President Trump signed the executive order.
Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that, going forward, they can choose to do business with the United States or with North Korea, but not both. This new executive order enables Treasury to freeze assets of anyone conducting significant trade in goods, services, or technology with North Korea. It also allows us to freeze assets of actors supporting North Korea’s textile, fishing, IT, and manufacturing industries.
We call on all countries around the world to join us by cutting off all trade and financial ties with North Korea in order to achieve a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. As President Trump stated in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, it is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it seizes its hostile behavior.
We will continue to work with our allies and partners to stop North Korea from using the global financial system to further Kim’s reckless behavior.
Thank you. And I’d be happy to take a few questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-092117/

The President has had a full day of engagements on his first day of the U.N. General Assembly.  This morning, he spoke by phone with the President of China on the need to keep the pressure on North Korea.
At the U.N., he participated in a meeting and gave remarks on reforming the United Nations as an institution so that it better lives up to the founding ideas.
The President supports the Secretary-General’s reform agenda for the United Nations, and was pleased to join nearly 130 countries and support a big, bold reform to eliminate inefficiency.
The President then spent some of time with his national security team going over tomorrow’s address to the General Assembly, which will be his first.  I know you heard from a senior White House official on that earlier, and as a reminder, those comments are embargoed until 9:00 p.m. tonight.  If you didn’t get that, let our press team know and we’ll make sure we send you the transcript.
In the afternoon, the President participated in two bilateral meetings, one with the Prime Minister of Israel and the other with the President of France.  We’ll have readouts of those meetings shortly.
Tonight he will host a working dinner with key Latin American leaders to discuss the crisis in Venezuela.  And we’ll also have a readout of that dinner.
Tomorrow will be another big day, but before we get to tomorrow, I’d like to introduce Brian Hook.  Brian is the Director of Policy at the State Department and Senior Advisor to the Secretary of State.  He participated in today’s meetings and engagements and can give you more detail on those.
The ground rules are that Brian will speak on the record but off camera, and his remarks are embargoed until the conclusion of the briefing.  He’ll be happy to take questions from you guys specific to activities ongoing here at the U.N.  If you have questions beyond that scope, the press team is happy to follow up with you after by email or phone.  As you know, we’re here and happy to help.
So with that, I’ll turn it over to Brian.  Thanks, guys.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-state-department-director-policy-planning-brian-hook-sep-18/

1:21 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  At the top I’d like to read a statement on the recent attacks in the UK and France:
The United States strongly condemns the cowardly terrorist attack in London today that targeted innocent civilians during their commute on the subway.  We are grateful that no one was killed in this horrific incident.  And our thoughts and prayers are with those injured, and we wish them a speedy and full recovery.
We are aware of the arrest that took place in Paris following the attack on a counterterrorism soldier, and we are thankful that the soldier was not seriously injured.
We are also aware of the attack in Burgundy, and our thoughts are with those wounded in that incident.  France is our oldest and one of our closest allies, and we will certainly provide any support to their investigations that they request.
Looking ahead to next week, the President and key members of his foreign policy team will be in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly.
Here today are National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and United States Representative to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who will walk you through the meetings and other events of next week and then take some of your questions.
As always I’ll be up afterwards to answer questions, unless of course you guys want to give me a free pass since it’s Friday.  (Laughter.)
And with that, I’ll turn it over.  Thanks.
GENERAL MCMASTER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I also want to begin by acknowledging the horrific attacks in Europe.  The United States, of course, stands in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom and France.  We will continue to work tirelessly with our partners to prevent attacks.  And, of course, the United States remains committed to defeating terrorist organizations, as well as their evil ideology.
The President has been unambiguous here, energizing our defeat-ISIS campaign, and calling on Muslim-majority nations to combat extremism and to end financing of terrorist organizations.  We will defend our people and our values against these cowardly attacks, and we will always stand with countries around the world to do the same.
Now, I want to turn to President Trump’s trip next week to attend the 72nd United Nations General Assembly.  The President’s consistent message across all of his engagements throughout the week will emphasize three goals common to all nations who will be gathered there:  First, to promote peace.  Second, to promote prosperity.  And third, to uphold sovereignty and accountability.
A peaceful world depends on the contributions of all nations.  We must share responsibility for international security, while each country protects the security of its own people.
Prosperity is also a shared responsibility.  The President looks forward to furthering economic cooperation, investment opportunities, and new business ties with other governments and businesses across the world.  As always, this administration’s ironclad commitment to free, fair, and reciprocal trade and access to markets will be the bedrock of our economic talks.
Sovereignty and accountability are the essential foundations of peace and prosperity.  America respects the sovereignty of other countries, expects other nations to do the same, and urges all governments to be accountable to their citizens.  That accountability is broken down in places such as Venezuela and Syria.  And we also see, today, revisionist powers who are threatening the sovereignty in the greater Middle East, Eastern and Southern Europe, and in East Asia.
Now, let me quickly run through the President’s schedule.  On Monday, the President will join senior U.N. leadership and the leaders of more than 120 other nations to discuss reforming the institution.  The President will express support for Secretary General Guterres’s reform efforts.  The United Nations, of course, holds tremendous potential to realize its founding ideals, but only if it’s run more efficiently and effectively.
That day, the President will also meet with the leaders of France and Israel, two of America’s closest allies.  While their conversations will be wide-ranging, we expect that Iran’s destabilizing behavior, including its violation of the sovereignty of nations across the Middle East, to be a major focus.
Monday evening, the President will host a working dinner with Latin American leaders.  He’s looking forward to discussing the crisis in Venezuela, as well as our increasingly strong economic ties, shared goals for elevating the prosperity of our peoples, and the extraordinary success of likeminded Latin American nations in recent decades.
The President’s Tuesday morning speech to the General Assembly will emphasize the need for states to promote peace and prosperity, while upholding sovereignty and accountability as indispensable foundations of international order.  He will urge all states to come together to address grave dangers that threaten us all.  If nations meet these challenges, immense opportunity lies before us.
Later that day, the President will have lunch with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, meet with this year’s General Assembly President, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák of Slovakia, and meet with the Emir of Qatar.  In the evening, he will host a traditional diplomatic reception.
On Wednesday, the President will meet with the leaders of Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, the United Kingdom, and Egypt.  He will host a working luncheon with African leaders to discuss how the United States can help African nations develop their economies, address urgent challenges, and strengthen security relationships and economic relationships between our nations.
Finally, on Thursday, the President will meet with the leaders of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Ukraine.  The latter two countries in particular have suffered direct and persistent attacks on their sovereignty in recent years.
He will also host a lunch with the leaders of South Korea and Japan.  As Kim Jong-un’s most recent missile launch demonstrates, North Korea remains one of the world’s most urgent and dangerous security problems.  It is vital that all nations work together to do our utmost to solve that problem.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Ambassador Haley.
AMBASSADOR HALEY:  Thank you very much.  And I will tell you that next week is not going to be short on topics.  I think, first of all, we can all say it is a new day at the U.N.  The U.N. has shifted over the past several months.  It’s not just about talking, it’s about action.
The members are starting to get used to act, whether it’s Security Council resolutions, whether it’s with U.N. reform, whether it’s with peacekeeping.  We’re starting to see a lot of changes at the U.N.  They are all anxious to see what the U.S. delegation looks like next week, and I think they will be heavily impressed with the fact that we have the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and many members of the National Security Council coming to really show the U.S. strength that we have in the world.
And I think — obviously this will be the first time that the President has addressed the General Assembly.  They are all very anxious to hear what he has to say.  And I think that he will make quite an impact in terms of all of the issues that we’re dealing with.
We have three events that will be extremely important.  First, the President will highlight the U.N. reform event.  It is very, very important.  We’ve got a massive reform package being led by the Secretary General that really streamlines not just the processes, but also the budget as it goes forward, and makes the U.N. much more effective.  We basically have the President headlining a U.N. reform effort, which would really support the Secretary General.  But the impressive part is, we asked other countries to sign on to their support of reform, and 120 countries have signed on and will be in attendance.  That’s a miraculous number.
The Vice President will be doing two very important briefings.  He’s going to do one on Human Rights Council.  Now more than ever, human rights matters.  We say all the time that if the government doesn’t take care of its people, bad things will happen.  And I think we’re seeing that in multiple places, and that’s all the reason why the Human Rights Council really needs to be effective.  We have offered reform.  I think the Vice President will go in and not only support the reform, but talk about why it’s needed and the areas that are really needing to be addressed when it comes to human rights.
The second one he’s going to do is on peacekeeping.  And in the last several months, we have taken every peacekeeping mandate and changed it.  Basically, we have saved half a billion dollars in peacekeeping.  But before anyone thinks that’s a travesty, basically the way they handled peacekeeping in the past was, if there was a challenged area they would throw more troops at it.  But they didn’t see if the troops were trained or give them the equipment to do their job.  Now we’re going towards the political solution, making sure the troops are trained and armed, making sure that we’re more effective.  So it’s smarter and it cut half a billion, and in some cases we’re having to increase, and in some cases we’re having to decrease.
So having the Vice President talk about the importance of the peacekeeping being effective is going to be very important.
And then, as I said, there are no shortage of issues, with North Korea being front and center.  Iran will be an issue.  Syria will certainly be talked about.  Terrorism efforts and how we counter that is a huge topic on what we’re dealing with.  And obviously the humanitarian issues that we face around the world.
So, with that, I think the General Assembly is going to be quite active next week, and I think the U.S. is going to be very strong next week.  And we look forward to a very good week.
GENERAL MCMASTER:  Gentleman in the center.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-national-security-advisor-h-r-mcmaster-u-n-ambassador-nikki-haley-091517/

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  I want to start off by reiterating the messages that FEMA Administrator Brock Long and the President’s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Officer Tom Bossert made this morning regarding the ongoing relief efforts in the wakes of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.
Life-sustaining operations are still underway, and we encourage everyone in the designated areas in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to register online at >www.DisasterAssistance.gov<.  That’s the quickest way to register for federal assistance.
As I said yesterday, the President was pleased that members on all sides of the aisle came together last week under his leadership to deliver critical relief to those affected by the storms.  And he has continued that spirit of bipartisanship and unity this week.
Last night, he hosted Republican and Democrat senators to discuss advancing the administration’s legislative priorities, particularly the importance of delivering tax cuts and reform for the middle class.
Today, in addition to important meetings with Republican and Democrat House members and Senator Tim Scott, the President will also host Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi this evening for a bipartisan discussion on the upcoming legislative agenda, with a focus on tax reform.  Historic tax reform is one of the most significant ways that we will jumpstart our economy, creating jobs and raising wages for all Americans.
The President and his team will continue to engage with all members of Congress who are willing to work with us to deliver this critical relief for the American people.
Finally, on a slightly lighter note, I’d like to announce that Frank from Falls Church, Virginia, whose letter I read last month offering his services to mow the White House lawn, will be here on Friday.  He’ll work with the grounds-keeping crew here at the White House and will help cut the grass in the Rose Garden.
The President is committed to keeping the American Dream alive for kids like Frank, and we’re all looking forward to having him here.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-091317/

2:45 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  This morning, we had the honor of joining of the President at the Pentagon to observe the anniversary of September 11th with the families and survivors of the horrific attack on our homeland that took the lives of 2,977 of their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, husbands, and wives 16 years ago.  The lives of those survivors and families were changed forever on that day, and our country has never been the same since the unimaginable evil of terrorism reached our shores.
In response to the attacks we are memorializing today, the Department of Homeland Security was created and given a vital mission:  securing our nation from the many threats we face, from counterterrorism and border security, to disaster preparedness and relief, which we know all too well in light of FEMA’s work surrounding Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
The men and women, in responding to these storms, embody the spirit under which DHS was established.  The President recognized a Pentagon police officer this morning who sped to the scene of the crash at the Pentagon as soon as he heard of the attack, and saved as many as 20 people.  Like Isaac, the first responders to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey are running directly into danger to save lives and serve our nation.  I hope that every American can take comfort in the fact that, in the face of unbelievable tragedy, this country has always come together to heal, protect, and save.
From the firefighters and police officers who rushed into burning buildings on 9/11 to the first responders on the ground in Florida, the United States Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, FEMA, through its national and regional response coordination centers and liaisons to the National Hurricane Center, continues to actively monitor the track of Hurricane Irma and support local authorities responding to the damage the storm has already caused.
I’d like to bring up Tom Bossert, the President’s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor to provide an update on issues related to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey before I take questions.  As always, he’ll make an opening statement and take questions, and then I’ll be back up to answer further questions.
MR. BOSSERT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Good afternoon.  It’s a somber day today.  And I, and Sarah, and others were honored to join the President at the Pentagon in a moment of silence, on the South Lawn as well.
In addition, I would note that President Trump continued a long tradition of Presidents since 9/11 to receive a counterterrorism briefing this morning in the Oval Office from his intelligence community, from his Director of National Counterterrorism Center, from myself, and others on the team.  The purpose of that is to give the President a sense of the terrorist threat that exists globally and to the homeland, and to give him a sense of what we’re doing about it, and make sure that he’s comfortable with our posture.
As I said the other day, we don’t have any current, active threats against the homeland to our knowledge, and that’s a good news story for today.
Let me move into a quick thought.  Before I do it though, Sarah noted that we created the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of 9/11.  I would note that the government engaged in a massive reorganization of its structures and efforts to create a National Counterterrorism Center; to create a Department of Homeland Security; an Office of the Director of National Intelligence; a U.S. Northern Command, which you’ve seen now marshal resources in an expert fashion for this storm; a combatant command in the United States of America; and Cyber Command, which you’ve seen recently President Trump elevate to a full combatant command.
And so we’ve marshaled our resources and we’ve organized them in a way to confront the threat of terrorism, but also to organize ourselves in a way that would allow us to respond to any event, from a manmade hazard to an unfortunate terrorist attack, but also to a hurricane.
So let me see if I can today talk to you about what we’ve done.  I believe Harvey, as I said earlier, was the best integrated, unified, joint federal, local, state response effort that our country has seen in its history.  I continue to stand by that.  We’ve got roughly 700,000 registrants now for individual assistance in the greater Houston and South Texas area.  Governor Abbott continues to demonstrate leadership, and President Trump continues to work with him and direct his Cabinet to not lose focus on the people of Texas.
With respect to Hurricane Irma, as you now know, it’s a tropical depression.  That does not mean it’s not a dangerous storm.  As you’ll see from reporting, Jacksonville is suffering what has been called early some of the worst flooding it has seen in 100 years.  And so the category might be reduced, but the effects on Jacksonville, for instance, when you combine storm surge and wind, might now replicate that of a Category 3 storm, even though it’s a tropical depression.
So as that flooding is ongoing, we have lifesaving, life-sustaining operations underway, and we are prayerful that there are not people right now trapped by floodwaters.
The President spoke this morning to the Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Governor Mapp expressed — and I joined that call — his thankfulness to our administration’s help, with the U.S. government providing such a rapid response and an ongoing response, I would add.
So if I could on that, I’ll speak to it later.  But the mobilization of our military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation.  And we now have an Air Force aircraft carrier deployed in this effort; this was the first-ever as well.
So we have the largest flotilla operation in our nation’s history to help not only the people of Puerto Rico, the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands, but also of St. Maarten and other non-U.S. islands affected, and the people of Florida.
With respect to Puerto Rico, the President spoke to the Governor of Puerto Rico this morning around 11:30 a.m. and they discussed similarly how happy they were with the federal response to their needs.  The governor communicated to the President that they still have a large, island-wide power outage problem that we are addressing as soon as we can.
And then Florida, if I can speak to Florida — I think Governor Scott has been demonstrating an outstanding leadership instinct and pressing forward, continuing the message of getting people out of harm’s way — which, by the way, is an ongoing effort.  The storm is still hitting the United States, in Georgia and South Carolina.  It’ll move up through an inland flooding problem in Tennessee, maybe North Carolina, as we see the storm progress.
Governor Scott has, at this stage, begun conducting overflight surveys of the Keys.  And it looks like to the north and east of Key West, the storms there took — the islands there took the largest brunt of the storm.  So I’ll be able to speak to that when we take questions.
And then if I can come back to 9/11, I think the lesson we learned that day, among others, was that not only does evil exist but good people taking action can confront that.  And what I’ve been reinsured — assured and reassured about over the last 24 hours is how many good people are taking action.  So that’s kind of my lesson for today.
I’d like to take questions now.

1:48 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  The President is constantly monitoring Hurricane Irma, and the federal government is working closely with our state and local partners to ensure the safety of the coastal communities.
In his Weekly Address to the nation this morning, the President noted that this is a storm of historic destructive potential, and he’s asking that everyone in the storm’s path remain vigilant and heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement.
Our message to the American people is this:  With gratitude for our first responders, and prayers for those in the storm’s path, we are behind you 100 percent.
With that, I’d like to bring up the President’s Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, to discuss specifics on the federal government’s ongoing preparedness and response efforts.
And after, I’ll be up to take further questions.  Thanks.
MR. BOSSERT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Thanks to each of you for being here.  I can’t add too much more to that, so let me see if I can just jump in a little bit to my thinking here.  As you’ve heard me say before, I like to try to categorize my thoughts into informing, influencing, and inspiring, if I can.
In terms of informing, please recall the process here is that the federal government, under President Trump’s leadership and the leadership of his Cabinet, is fully engaged, but they’re fully engaged in support of the governors.  Those governors at this point are engaged in various different forms and phases of what we consider incident management.
So as I walk through Irma, let me stop — I’d be remiss if I didn’t — and talk about Texas and Harvey.
So, Governor Abbott and I have been in close contact and haven’t stopped that contact, because his people in Texas and the people of Louisiana, under Governor Edwards, are involved in the early stages of what will be a long recovery effort.
The people in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the other Caribbean islands affected by Harvey [Irma] already are in the middle of acute lifesaving and life-sustaining response operations.
And what we’re seeing in Florida and South Carolina and Georgia are the final stages of preparation for the beginning of response operations.
So we’re seeing all three play out for us at the same time.  It requires us to juggle some of our thinking, but it doesn’t require us to juggle our resources.
So, to be clear, the response operations have ceased lifesaving and life-sustaining in Harvey, and we had an opportunity to rest and refit our forces, move them out, and reposition them for Harvey [Irma].  We’re right now employing them in the islands to save lives, and we will maintain a good footprint and posture to do the same in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia as the storm progresses.
So I’ll come back to some of the path and the track and forecast here in a moment.  I’d like to see if I could reinforce that by suggesting we take this very seriously.  It’s not only a dangerous storm; we’ve already seen loss of life.  This storm has taken lives already.  It’s going to take more, unfortunately, if we’re not prepared.  So please take it seriously.
I’d also suggest now, in terms of influencing, that people stop watching so carefully this track, and start thinking a little bit more seriously about getting themselves into a safe place and out of danger.  Now, I don’t want them to take that as a call for shadow evacuations.  Please listen to your local authorities on evacuation orders.  They’re not only looking out for your best interest, but they’re carefully coordinating.  This is a peninsula, and so people need to evacuate from south to north, and that is a staggered and carefully thought-through process.
But what I am suggesting is, at this point this is a large storm.  And whether it wobbles left or wobbles right, you need to at this point start thinking through your own personal accountability.  So please make sure — it’s kind of an oxygen mask theory — take care of yourself first so you can take care of others, take care of your loved ones.  And if you’re able, please take care of strangers and others in need.  I think that’s something that we’ve seen in Texas and I have every reason to believe that the people of Florida and South Carolina will show that same American spirit and value.
Lastly, if I can, there’s been a lot of kind of coverage of Florida but not necessarily media coverage of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  And if I can, I’ll give you a brief update on where we stand there.
We are, as I just talked to Department of State and Department of Defense officials, engaging in this lifesaving, life-sustaining operation in the following way:  Governor Mapp is experiencing loss of power; loss of water, as a result; loss of communications; and some other sheltering needs.  And so what we’re doing is sending in air operations and surface operations to evacuate citizens.  We’re also doing that in St. Martin and St. Maarten, the Dutch-French island that’s been reported there are some American citizens there.
We are currently in the final stages of operations planning to evacuate those citizens.  There are numbers ranging from 350 to 6,000.  That was our planning assumption parameter.  Those American citizens will be removed via surface and air means.  We’ve had to do some kind of planning adjustment for surf conditions for wind and for Hurricane Jose as we look forward to that hopefully missing the United States.  It’s unfortunately still causing some havoc in the islands, in our response operations, our evacuation operations.
So that’s where we stand on that.  They’ll begin executing those plans, if not already, at some point soon today.  And we’ll see some of those American citizens and other evacuated as necessary, to include anyone with critical or acute medical needs.
So that’s where I would stop on the update, and I’ll take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-homeland-security-advisor-tom-bossert-090817/

1:54 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  This morning, faced with the very real possibility of a potential immediate shutdown of the entire DACA program by a federal court, President Trump took the responsible and constitutional step of announcing that the administration will be phasing out the program over the next two years.
Today’s September 5th deadline was set by the plaintiffs presenting the administration with two, and only two, real options to choose from:  the likely sudden cancellation of the program by a judge or an orderly wind-down that preserves the rule of law and returns the question to the legislative branch where it belongs.  The President chose the latter of the two options.
The President made the best decision in light of the fact that the system was set up by the Obama administration, in clear violation of federal law.  President Obama even admitted this himself when announcing the program, calling it a “temporary stopgap measure” and calling on Congress to act.
DACA was initiated after Congress explicitly rejected the same proposal in legislative form.  In other words, President Obama didn’t just suspend federal law, but implemented a policy Congress had explicitly rejected.
There is a misconception that DACA primarily serves as a shield from deportation.  This is misleading.  DACA grants work authorization to nearly 800,000 individuals who are not legally authorized to work.  DACA recipients, whose average age is in their 20s, were not an enforcement priority before, and they certainly won’t become a priority now.  The priorities remain the same:  criminals, security threats, and those who repeatedly violate our immigration laws.
The main effect of today’s announcement is that work permits and other government benefits are being gradually phased out.  But rather than leave DACA recipients and men and women of immigration enforcement in confusing limbo, while the DACA program was challenged by states in the same court that struck down another of the previous administration’s unlawful immigration orders earlier this year, President Obama [sic] is laying out a responsible 24-month phase-out — sorry, President Trump.  (Laughter.)
No permits will be expiring for another six months, and permits will remain active for up to two full years.  The President was elected partly on his promise to deliver meaningful immigration reform that puts the jobs, wages, and security of the American people first.  He is delivering on that promise every day, and he has put forward serious proposals to Congress that would responsibly end illegal immigration, prevent visa overstays, remove dangerous criminals, protect American jobs and wages, and create a merit-based system that grows our middle class.
These are not just President Trump’s priorities; they are the American people’s priorities.  For decades now, the American people, immigrant and U.S.-born, have asked Congress to establish a lawful immigration system that protects our country.  They’ve asked for strong, secure borders, they’ve asked us to protect American security and American jobs, and they’ve asked us to have compassion, not only for those who are here illegally, but for unemployed American citizens, including millions of unemployed African American and Hispanic citizens who continue to suffer under a broken system.
The President’s DACA decision today brings us closer to a safer, fairer, and legal immigration system.  Now that he has ended this unsustainable and unconstitutional program imposed by the previous administration, the President is calling on the men and women in Congress to fulfill their duty to the American people by truly reforming our immigration system for the good of all people.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-090517/

3:26 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Apologize for the delay — I wanted to make sure the Governor of Texas was able to complete his briefing before we came out, and that you guys were able to pay attention to that.
I’ll keep it quick up here at the top so that we can get to your questions.
The President and his homeland security team, and the entire administration continue to focus on the lives and safety of those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana. Yesterday, at the direction of the President, the Vice President and Mrs. Pence, Labor Secretary Acosta, Transportation Secretary Chao, Energy Secretary Perry, VA Secretary Shulkin, and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Duke traveled to Texas to speak with people on the ground and assess the damage.
Earlier today, the President signed a proclamation declaring this Sunday a National Day of Prayer for those affected by the hurricane.  And just this afternoon, the President heard from the heads of the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, and Southern Baptist Disaster Relief on their efforts throughout the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.
As Gail McGovern, President and CEO of the American Red Cross, said, the American people are “bound and determined” to bounce back, and these organizations, along with so many others, have been on the ground from the beginning helping the people of Texas and Louisiana do just that.
The President will be back in Texas tomorrow to visit with storm survivors and tell them personally that the federal government is here to help in any way that we can.
The President is currently finalizing a supplemental request to support the needs of emergency responders at the federal, state, and local level.  And we’ll share more information on that later.
The President has had calls with several foreign leaders who expressed their support for the American people during this difficult time.  Just today, he spoke with the presidents of South Korea, Kazakhstan, and Colombia.  And we’ll have readouts coming on each of those calls later today.
And I’d also like to take this opportunity to follow up on a question I was asked yesterday, and announce that the President will host the Emir of Kuwait at the White House on September 7th and the President of Spain on September 26th.
Finally, I’d like to reiterate the message that Tom Bossert, the President’s Homeland Security Advisor, gave yesterday.  In case there is anyone watching today that is in need of assistance, once you have access to a functioning computer, please go to www.DisasterAssistance.gov.  And if you have access to a working phone, please call 1-800-621-3362.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-090117/

3:01 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  I know most of you, and more importantly the American people, have many questions related to Hurricane Harvey.
And as you all know, the President was in Corpus Christi and Austin earlier this week, and today at the President’s direction, the Vice President, Mrs. Pence, and five Cabinet secretaries are back in Texas meeting with local officials and storm survivors, and thanking many of the first responders and other volunteers.
The President’s team here has been working around the clock to support state and local authorities following the storm.  And now, I want to bring up Tom Bossert, the President’s Homeland Security Advisor, to provide and update on the administration-wide effort to support the recovery and relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.
He’ll make a few opening remarks and then stay to take questions specific to the storm and what the administration is doing to help the state and local authorities and the people of Texas and Louisiana.  And as always, after Tom speaks and takes your questions, I’ll be back up here to take questions on other topics.
Thanks, guys.
MR. BOSSERT:  Thanks, Sarah.  Let me see if I can start by addressing maybe some different audiences.  We’ve got international audience, national audience, state and local audience, and I want to see if I can speak to each one of them with a brief update and where we stand.
From the international perspective, we’ve had heads of state from a lot of different countries.  In particular, I would stress today, yesterday the heads of state of Mexico and Canada called to express their condolences, their prayers and thoughts, but also assistance if they could lend anything to the effort.  We very much appreciate that, and the President was deeply touched by those phone calls.
I joined him for the call from Justin Trudeau just moments ago, and we appreciate the neighborly gesture quite seriously.  And it’s an international expression of what we’re seeing here at a very local level.  We’ve got neighbors helping neighbors in Texas and Louisiana, but also neighbors that aren’t in close proximity internationally expressing help to our international neighbors, though Canada and Mexico are also offering their condolences, and we very much appreciate it.
We’re seeing deployed assets now from a lot of states.  I know we’ve got 28, for instance, search and rescue teams and taskforces from, I think, 16 different states all sending down their support to Texas.  That’s a pretty large activation.  In fact, I believe that that’s the first time we’ve activated all the task forces since 9/11.
So this is an all-hands-on-deck operation, and it’s not just a federal one.  There are state and local officials from all walks — even from Pennsylvania, where I’m from, there are people now addressing this problem by getting their hands dirty and going right down to Texas to help.  So we want to stop and say thank you to them for that.
And then, if I can move to the nation, many of you are watching this and you want to hear from us what we’re doing.  I want to make sure you understand that you should continue to have confidence in what we’re doing as a government.  There are significant commodity numbers and numbers of personnel and materiel moving into this affected region, and it’s an increasing number every day as we move forward.
But I would be remiss if I didn’t stop and say that none of that matters if you’re an affected individual.  So 10,000 liters of water doesn’t matter if I don’t have the one liter I need to drink right now.
And so if I could, I’d like to stop and give a message or two directly to the people who need the assistance.  If I can, this might sound a little bit mundane from a White House podium, but if you’re in need of assistance and you have access to a functioning computer, if you can get to a shelter or someplace where you can do this, it’s very important that you go to >www.DisasterAssistance.gov<.  You can find what you need there to register for the assistance that you might need.
If you don’t have access but you can find a working telephone, 1-800-462-7585.  Again, 1-800-462-7585.  There’s another number that FEMA has given us of 621-3362.  I’m going to clarify and say — I think 621 — 1-800-621-3362, that’s the number — 3362 spells FEMA.  That second number of 7585 is the TTY number.
I want to make sure that people use those numbers and use those resources to register.  I’d also like to give them the advice that it’s never too early to call your insurance adjustor, make sure if you have property loss or damage, you’ve got the process underway.  It can take some time.  There’s going to be a high volume of calls, and we want to make sure your needs are attended to as soon as possible.
So that’s where we stand right now.  I’d like to go through a few additional messages.
Lifesaving and life-sustaining operations are still underway.  We’ve seen some hospitals suffer some damage in Beaumont.  Most of you that are tracking the event have seen that.  The DOD and the HHS officials responsible for coordinating the federal response here are actively figuring out and deploying resources to help move those patients to a better definitive care location.  So we will see probably upwards of 7,000 estimated patients moved into better and safer definitive care hospitals elsewhere in Texas.  And we’ll see that happen expeditiously, and I’m quite comfortable with where those operations stand.
Secondly, a little word of caution:  A lot of lost lives end up in this time zone right after a response.  We lose, unfortunately, some lives in an immediate disaster, but then in the immediate response and recovery phase, people will use chainsaws, people will remove debris, people will be stressed.  The elderly, when they’re stressed, you heard Dr. Fauci say, tend to get sick.  That sickness can lead to death, unfortunately.
And so, unfortunately, we will see additional losses of life if history is any precedent here — or if that history is any prologue, we will see additional loss of life.  So please try to avoid that, try to avoid strain and stress.  Try to get to where there’s food, water, and shelter, and take care of yourself so that you can then take care of others.
With that, I’d like to suggest that from the FEMA perspective, they’re continuing that operation.  But from the White House, it’s important that we look at the cost of these events and that we look on the horizon a little bit about what’s next.
So as we look into it — these are estimates at this point — but it looks like around about 100,000 affected homes.  That’s a big number.  We’re going to have 100,000 affected homes, all with different degrees of insurance, some with flood insurance, some underinsured, some uninsured.  We’ll have to address those on a case-by-case basis as we move forward, but I want to put a scope and magnitude on this.
We’re also going to have damage to publicly owned infrastructure.  And so what we will do as an administration is put together a responsible supplemental request for Congress — an appropriations request.  We’ll make that request shortly.  We’ll make that request based on the information that we have now.  And what we’ll do then is come back later for a second supplemental request when we have additional information that would make a more informed total for Congress to consider.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER
AND HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER TOM BOSSERT
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:55 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon, everybody.  I hope you don’t mind, I brought a few friends today.  We’ve got a lot to get through so I’m going to keep it short on the front end, and then of course I’ll be back up to take your questions.
First, I’d like to invite Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster up to discuss the new financial sanctions on the dictatorship in Venezuela that the President imposed today.  They’ll each deliver brief opening remarks and take your questions on that topic.
After that, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert will be up to give an update and take your questions on preparations for Hurricane Harvey.  The administration has been closely monitoring the situation, and we want to make sure the American people are fully briefed on this important news of the day.
And finally, after all the three of them wrap up, I’ll be back up here to take a few of your questions on other topics.
Thanks.
GENERAL MCMASTER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  As you’ve seen, the President signed a new executive order that strongly punishes the Venezuelan regime.  This order demonstrates more clearly than ever that the United States will not allow an illegitimate dictatorship to take hold in the Western Hemisphere at the expense of its people.
Through the President’s strong action, the United States will target the means with which the Maduro dictatorship can accumulate debt to enrich its corrupt regime insiders and perpetuate its repressive behavior.
Only six weeks ago, several million Venezuelans voted overwhelmingly against the Maduro regime’s plans to convene a constituent assembly that the people of Venezuela never requested.  The United States and the regional community stood in solidarity with the Venezuelan people and demanded that their voices be heard.
But Maduro chose to embrace dictatorship over his own people.  As a result, a dozen of Venezuela’s neighbors gathered in Lima, Peru, and rejected Maduro’s actions.
President Trump promised strong action if Maduro moved ahead and ignored his people’s will.  With today’s announcement, the President is keeping his promise of strong action and continuing to show strong leadership.
This executive order does not need to be permanent.  The President has said that “a stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere.”
We will continue to work with our friends and partners in the international community to support the Venezuelan people until their rights and democracy are fully restored.
Now I’ll turn it over to Secretary Mnuchin to describe this executive order in greater detail.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you.  Today’s executive order demonstrates the U.S. government’s condemnation of tyranny and dictatorship in Venezuela.  The Maduro regime has consistently shown hostility to the rule of law, democratic institutions, and the Venezuelan people.
This has been a catastrophe for the country.  Nicolas Maduro has financed his regime by hollowing out Venezuela through economic mismanagement, corruption, and the assumption of onerous debt.
Let me be clear:  Today’s action is focused on restricting the regime’s access to American debt and equity markets.  Maduro may no longer take advantage of the American financial system to facilitate the wholesale looting of the Venezuelan economy at the expense of the Venezuelan people.
These measures will also undermine Maduro’s ability to pay off political cronies and regime supporters, and increase pressure on the regime to abandon its disastrous path.
Under the executive order, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in specified dealings involving the government of Venezuela and its instrumentalities.  This includes state-owned oil company PDVSA.  These prohibitions extend to transactions or activities occurring in the United States and cover both debt and equity instruments.
In an effort to minimize the undue harm to the American and Venezuelan people and global markets, we are issuing general licenses permitting transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under the executive order.  These include a 30-day wind-down period, the financing for humanitarian goods to Venezuela, and certain dealings in specified debt instruments that trade on secondary markets, and certain dealings with U.S. entities owned or controlled by the government of Venezuela.
Also, the executive order carves out short-term financing for most commercial trade, including the export and import of petroleum.
This executive order builds on a number of actions taken by the U.S. government to prevent the flow of funds to Maduro’s regime.  On my first day in office, I was here with you at this podium where the Treasury Department designated the Venezuelan vice president under the Kingpin Act.  And this year alone, we have sanctioned 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself.
We urge those within the regime, including those who have been sanctioned, to distance themselves from the violence and the dictatorship.  President Trump made it clear the status quo is unacceptable.  Today’s actions is the next step towards freedom for the Venezuelan people.  We will continue working to achieve this goal with allies around the world who have widely condemned Venezuela’s dictatorship.
And with that I’d be happy to take some questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-et-al-082517/

2:57 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS: Good afternoon. It’s good to be back. You guys don’t seem nearly as excited. I thought for sure there’d be balloons or something. We’ll save that for next time, I guess.
Earlier this week, the President delivered his first prime time address to the nation on our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia. The President’s strategy is based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables. And it will ensure terrorists never again use Afghanistan as a haven to attack the United States.
The brave men and women of our nation’s military have given extraordinary sacrifices to this longest war in American history.
The President recognized those sacrifices on Monday during his speech, and I would like to recognize one particular story here today.
Joseph, a gentleman from Santa Fe, Tennessee, sent his son, a master sergeant in the United States Air Force, a letter nearly 10 years ago while he was serving our country in Iraq.
Now his son is on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, and his father has generously shared the letter and mailed it to the President that he wrote.
Joseph told the President that he has been a police officer for over 30 years and that he sent this letter to his son and on to the White House in hopes that the President would actually receive it and read it, which I’m glad to say that he did earlier today.
In his letter to his son, Joseph wrote:
“Please don’t lose sight of your purpose. You are the only hope and glimmer of light for the good, innocent men, women, and children that you are protecting. This may be hard for you to see or understand. Most people know that all of you are there because you volunteered to be there. Your actions and dedication are seen by people throughout the world as without a doubt the most heroic action of any person which can be made.
You and the soldiers standing next to you from all of the other countries are the pride of not only the nations they represent but every individual that yearns to be free.
Stand tall, my son, and be steadfast for it is you who are the defender of freedom.”
We owe it to the servicemen and women like the master sergeant who have fought in our name in Afghanistan for 17 years — and to the families who have watched them go — to secure an honorable and lasting outcome to this conflict.
As the President said on Monday, “The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. And once that victory has been achieved, they also deserve to return home to a country that honors their sacrifices and provides our nation’s heroes with the support they’ve earned by risking their lives to ensure the freedoms of all Americans.”
That’s why the President was also honored to sign yet another historic piece of legislation to support our veterans earlier this week. The VA Choice Act streamlines the lengthy process of appealing claims for disability benefits for the more than 470,000 veterans that are still waiting for decisions.
Under the leadership of Secretary Shulkin, the VA is steadily delivering on the President’s promise to fix the broken VA system.
Finally, before I’d open it up to take your questions, as you’re all very well aware, I kind of love birthdays around here. And oddly, we have quite a few of them going on. Major Garrett, happy birthday. But even more importantly, I’m pretty lucky — I think I have two of the best parents in the world, and it’s my dad’s birthday. So happy birthday, Dad. And it’s my niece’s birthday, so I get to knock out a ton of stuff today. My only niece, Caroline, turned four today.
And with that, I will take your questions. Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-082417/

5734,Trump,2017-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,Press Briefing Call on the Vice President’s Trip to Latin America,Nan,"Via Teleconference
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The Vice President is traveling to South and Central America, as my colleague said, to visit Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and Panama.  These are four key partners and friends of the United States and each in their own way are emblematic of a positive direction that we’ve seen in Latin America — open markets, strong democracies.
The Vice President will meet with President Santos in Colombia, visit with President Macri in Argentina, Bachelet in Chile, and Varela in Panama.  And many of these, he’s either joined the President here in the White House or hosted in the West Wing, and also had phone calls.  So looking forward to reengaging with those four key leaders.
We’re going to further our close economic and security ties.  We’ll express to all four the support for important economic reform efforts across the region, and, again, share concerns with the disturbing collapse of democracy in Venezuela that I’m sure will be raised in all the stops.
Honing down a little bit in each country — in Colombia, our visit to Cartagena will highlight our strong bilateral ties with Colombia.  That includes our support for the country’s efforts to address some serious challenges of implementing its peace accords.  They are reducing historic levels of drug cultivation which was at an all-time high.  And we’ll also highlight our significant trade and investment relationships.  You’ll see that theme through all four stops.  Underpinning our bilateral trade promotion agreement that’s been in place since 2012.
The Vice President is also going to underscore the helpful role Colombia is playing to increase pressure on the Maduro regime.  He’s going to call on Colombia to continue to take actions against the Maduro regime and assist with other regional actors to do the same.
Then, as my colleague said, we’ll transit to Argentina.  In Argentina, the Vice President is going to highlight President Macri’s bold reform agenda, the reemergence of Argentina into a position of global leadership.  They’ll be hosting — Argentina will be hosting the WTO ministerial later this year.  And I’m certain you’ll hear from President Macri — they’re hosting the G20 in 2018, which is huge for them and for us, as well.
The Vice President will also deliver, as my colleague said, a major policy address in Buenos Aires.  We’ll outline a vision of productive engagement with likeminded partners across the region.  And we’ll talk about our shared commitments to security, to prosperity, and to democracy.
We’ll then fly down to Chile.  We’ll recognize Chile as a leader and a model for open and integrated economy, their solid, stable democracy.  We’ll highlight our successes of our trade relationship, the free trade agreements, and a robust security partnership.  And as my colleague mentioned, we’ll also highlight the 50th anniversary of the Association of U.S. Chambers in Latin America and the 100th anniversary of the American Chamber there in Chile — a very historical time for that organization.  He’ll address that in his speech with U.S. business community leaders.  He’ll note the positive legacy that our U.S. businesses have in the region, and recommit everyone to fighting corruption and building transparency in the region.
And then our last stop in Panama, the Vice President is going to continue to talk about our bilateral commercial and security relationships.  We’ll highlight the role of our new successful free trade agreement with Panama.  As my colleague said, he will tour at the historic Miraflores Lock and then the new expanded Cocoli Lock.  And we’ll talk about the historic connection and, really, the past, but more so looking at the future and the future that we’re going to build with them in the region.
And as my colleague mentioned, I would imagine in each of these stops we’ll talk about Venezuela.  All of these countries have demonstrated their clear support for democracy, rejecting the dictatorship of Maduro’s regime.  A note that the Declaration of Lima — I believe that was, gosh, a couple days ago now, on the 8th — 12 countries from the region expressed unanimous support for democracy in Venezuela, and we’ll reaffirm that with each of our stops.
So I’ll keep it at that so we can go to some questions.  Thanks, everybody.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-call-vice-presidents-trip-latin-america/

2:48 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon, everyone.
Before we get started, I’d like to hand it over to Stephen Miller, senior advisor to the President, to speak with you about the RAISE Act that the President endorsed this morning.  And I know you guys will have lot of fun.
Take it away, Stephen.
MR. MILLER:  Thank you.  Great to be here today to talk with you about the President’s new proposal for immigration reform.  I’ll just walk through the basics of it and then we’ll take some questions and hopefully be able to answer all of them.
So this is the largest proposed reform to our immigration policy in half a century.  The most important question when it comes to the U.S. immigration system is who gets a green card.  A green card is the golden ticket of U.S. immigration.
Every year we issue a million green cards to foreign nationals from all the countries of the world, but we do so without regard to whether that applicant has demonstrated the skill that can add to the U.S. economy, whether they can pay their own way or be reliant on welfare, or whether they’ll displace or take a job from an American worker.
And as a result of this policy, in place now for many years, we’ve seen significant reductions in wages for blue collar workers, massive displacement of African American and Hispanic workers, as well as the displacement of immigrant workers from previous years who oftentimes compete directly against new arrivals who are being paid even less.
So it’s a policy that’s actually exacerbated wealth inequality in the country in a pretty significant way.  So you’ve seen over time, as a result of this historic flow of unskilled immigration, a shift in wealth from the working class to wealthier corporations and businesses.  And it’s been very unfair for American workers, but especially for immigrant workers, African American workers, and Hispanic workers, and blue collar workers in general across the country.
At the same time, it has cost taxpayers enormously because roughly half of immigrant head of households in the United States receive some type of welfare benefit — which I know is a fact that many people might consider astonishing, but it’s not surprising when you have an immigration system that doesn’t look at questions like skill level or self-sufficiency.
And so this proposal has several major historic changes.  First, it eliminates so-called chain migration.  So right now, what does chain migration mean?  It means that if you come into the United States on a green card — and just so we’re all clear, a green card gives the recipient lifetime work authorization, the ability to bring in their family members.  It gives them a fast track to U.S. citizenship and, with that, all the benefits that come with being an American citizen.
And so the individuals right now who are receiving green cards, they can bring in, say, an elderly relative who could immediately go on to public assistance if they become unable to support themselves financially.  And then that person can bring in a relative who can bring in a relative who can bring in a relative, and that’s why they call it chain migration.  And over years, that has massively de-skilled the migrant flow into America and produced all of those effects I’m talking about.
So we’re proposing to limit family-based migration to spouses and minor children.  Additionally, we’re establishing a new entry system that’s points-based.  Australia has a points-based system, Canada has a points-based system.  And what will this system look at?  It will look at:  Does the applicant speak English?  Can they support themselves and their families financially?  Do they have a skill that will add to the U.S. economy?  Are they being paid a high wage?
The last part is very important because it will help prevent displacement of U.S. workers.  So if a company — let’s say they’re offering three times the median wage, that person will get more points on their application than if they’re being offered two times the median wage or one time the median wage.  So all of a sudden, you’re putting upward pressure on wages instead of downward pressure, and you’re making it very hard to use immigrant labor to substitute for American workers because by prioritizing higher paid workers, you basically end the practice, more or less, of being able to seek out permanent residents to come in at lower pay.
And so that’s a major historic change to U.S. immigration policy.  The effect of this, switching to a skills-based system and ending unfettered chain migration, would be, over time, you would cut net migration in half, which polling shows is supported overwhelmingly by the American people in very large numbers.
And I’ll just conclude by saying this is what President Trump campaigned on.  He talked about it throughout the campaign, throughout the transition, and since coming into office.
This is a major promise to the American people to push for merit-based immigration reform that protects U.S. workers, protects U.S. taxpayers, and protects the U.S. economy, and that prioritizes the needs of our own citizens, our own residents, and our own workers.  It’s pro-American immigration reform that the American people want, that the American people deserve, and that puts the needs of the working class ahead of the investor class.

MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Before we get started, I’d like to bring up National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to discuss the administration’s response to the Maduro regime’s recent anti-democratic actions in Venezuela.
They will each make opening remarks and then take your questions on the topic at hand.  And then as always — your favorite time of day — I’ll come back up and take your questions.  Thank you.
GENERAL MCMASTER:  Hi.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I thought it might be best just to read the President’s statement:
Since President Trump’s inauguration, the Trump administration has called on Venezuela’s Maduro regime to respect Venezuela’s constitution, respect the role and authorities of the constitutionally-established National Assembly, hold free and fair elections, address the humanitarian needs of the Venezuelan people, release political prisoners, and stop oppressing its great people.
The regime has refused to heed this call, and his recent actions culminating in yesterday’s outrageous seizure of absolute power through the sham election of the National Constituent Assembly represent a very serious blow to democracy in our hemisphere.
Maduro is not just a bad leader, he is now a dictator.  The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of this oppression.  We will work with our partners to hold accountable all those responsible for the escalating violence and ongoing human rights violations.
The President promised strong and swift actions if the regime went forward with imposing the National Constituent Assembly on the Venezuelan people, and he will keep that promise.
Secretary Mnuchin.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, General.  Today, the United States is broadening its effort to address the ongoing assault on Venezuela’s democratic institutions by the Maduro regime.
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, has sanctioned the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro Moros.  As a result of today’s sanctions, all assets of Maduro subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with him.
As President Trump said earlier this month, the strong and courageous actions by the Venezuelan people to stand for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law have been continually ignored by Nicolás Maduro, who dreams of becoming a dictator.  Yesterday’s illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people.  The National Constituent Assembly aspires, illegitimately, to usurp the constitutional role of democratically-elected National Assembly, rewrite the constitution, and impose an authoritarian regime on the people.  As such, it represents a rupture in Venezuela’s constitutional and democratic order.
By sanctioning Maduro, the United States makes clear our opposition to the policies of his regime and the support for the people of Venezuela, who strive to return their country to a full and prosperous democracy.  As the country’s head of state, Maduro is directly responsible for Venezuela’s descent and for the destruction of democracy.  Adding Maduro to OFAC’s list of specially-designated nationals reflects our commitment to not stand by idly as Venezuela continues to crumble under the regime’s abuses.
We hope that these sanctions will make all Maduro regime officials reconsider how their actions have affected their country.  These actions highlight the high cost and personal recriminations enablers of this regime could face if they continue their reckless and undemocratic activities.  Anyone who participates in this illegitimate ANC could be exposed to future U.S. sanctions for their role in undermining democratic process and institutions in Venezuela.
Now we’ll take a few questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-national-security-advisor-h-r-mcmaster-073117/

5795,Trump,2017-07-27 09:21:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,Nan,"
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Before we get started on some of the Q&A, I’d like to bring up Tom Homan, which some of you guys mays know and remember, the Acting Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Rob Hur, the Principal Deputy Attorney General, to talk with you about what the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are doing to eradicate criminal organizations like MS-13.
Mr. Hur will speak to the Justice Department’s work first, then Mr. Homan will discuss the ICE component, and Tom will stay and answer your questions.
As always, I’d like to put out a friendly reminder for you guys to stay on topic.  And after that, I’ll come back up to take your questions.  Thanks, guys.
MR. HUR:  Good afternoon.  My name is Robert Hur.  About five weeks ago, I was sworn in as the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice.  In that role, I serve as the principal advisor to the Deputy Attorney General.  I appreciate the chance to talk to you about the Justice Department’s aggressive efforts to achieve this administration’s goal of dismantling the gang, la Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13.
As you all know, the President is traveling to Long Island tomorrow to talk about our fight to eradicate the violent threat of MS-13.  And as we speak, the Attorney General is in El Salvador, where he will spend the next two days addressing the root of this problem, the San Salvadorian prisons that house the leaders of this dangerous gang.
While there, the Attorney General will meet with members of the Justice Department’s transnational anti-gang taskforce on the ground, in El Salvador, and the attorneys general from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to discuss joint efforts to disrupt and take down MS-13.
Earlier in my career, I served as a federal prosecutor in Maryland, where I personally prosecuted a number of MS-13 racketeering cases.  These included capital cases in which the defendants’ crimes were so violent and so heinous that the government saw fit to pursue the death penalty.
Through these prosecutions I learned firsthand from the victims, their grieving and heartbroken families, and other members of terrorized communities just want a scourge this group of thugs really is.
This gang’s chilling motto is: “Mata, viola, controla” — which means “kill, rape, and control.”  They seek to live up to this motto through truly shocking acts of violence designed to instill fear.  Vicious machete attacks, execution-style gunshots, gang-rape, and human trafficking.  They use whatever they can get their hands on — guns, knives, machetes, baseball bats, tire irons, or their fists and feet — not just to inflict violence.  They use violence to shock, to send a message, and to control territory here in the U.S. and in Central America.
The Attorney General has answered the President’s call.  And we at the Justice Department are moving forward aggressively against MS-13.  Specifically, pursuant to the President’s direction and executive orders, the Attorney General has directed the department’s law enforcement agencies — ATF, DEA, FBI and the Marshals Service, as well as federal prosecutors across the country — to prioritize the prosecution of gang members, specifically MS-13.
The Attorney General has issued charging guidance regarding violent crime and criminal immigration enforcement, both of which directly target MS-13 members and their associates.  In addition, the Department of Justice has requested funding for 300 more federal prosecutors to focus specifically on violent crime and criminal immigration enforcement.
We’ve also prioritize multi-agency and cross-border collaboration in order to attack MS-13 from all angles.  The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security are coordinating our anti-gang efforts to ensure that we bring both criminal and immigration laws to bear in the fight against transnational gangs.
We continue our critical partnerships with state and local law enforcement around the country whose brave men and women are truly on the front lines in the fight against MS-13.  And we work, of course, hand in glove with our law enforcement partners in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  They are helping us take the fight to MS-13 on its home turf.  It speaks volumes that the Attorney General himself has traveled to the nerve center of MS-13 and is standing in solidarity with our partners in Central America.
Indeed, earlier today, just hours ago, El Salvadorian prosecutors announced that they have filed charges against, and arrested, over the past 36 hours, hundreds of members of MS-13 in El Salvador.  Many of the defendants are members of MS-13 Peajes Locos Salvatruchos clique who are centered in the La Paz department of El Salvador.
Earlier this year, members of this MS-13 clique committed several high-profile murders in El Salvador.  The shooter in these murders fled to the United States and is now in ICE custody pending immigration proceedings.  This prosecution showcases just how closely we are working with our partners in El Salvador to combat MS-13.  Specifically, U.S. law enforcement agents with ICE, who are on the ground in El Salvador, are coordinating with their counterparts here in the U.S. to ensure that the shooter is removed from the United States as quickly as possible to face charges in El Salvador.
This investigation is being handled by Salvadorian gang prosecutors who are trained and mentored by embedded DOJ prosecutors in El Salvador and Salvadorian police officers who are trained and mentored by the FBI and advisors from the State Department.
At the request of Salvadorian prosecutors, the Justice Department has also arranged to have an essential witness to the murders transported to El Salvador for court proceedings.
The United States law enforcement and federal prosecutors recently targeted leaders and members of the same Peajes clique operating here in Maryland, charging 16 defendants with racketeering offenses involving murder and attempted murder, the last of whom was sentenced this year to life imprisonment.  These are very significant blows to MS-13 and are made possible by our close cross-border coordination.
We’ve also revitalized the Institutional Hearing Program, which brings immigration judges to Bureau Prisons facilities to adjudicate the immigration status of federal criminal alien inmates while they’re incarcerated.  This results in much quicker deportation after these criminals serve out their prison sentences here in the United States.
Finally, we are also holding sanctuary cities accountable for their lawless conduct.  The Attorney General will not allow sanctuary cities to become sanctuaries for criminals.  Earlier this week, the Attorney General announced new grant conditions.  Cities and states may only receive JAG grants if they comply with federal law, allow federal immigration officials access to detention facilities, and provide 48 hours’ notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities.
Taking on MS-13 is a top priority of this administration and this Justice Department.  We will not tire and we will not fail.  I am humbled to once again be in a position to work to reduce and ultimately decimate this gang to make our communities safe for all Americans.
Thank you.
MR. HOMAN:  Good afternoon.  I’m Tom Homan.  I’m the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.  Targeting, arresting, and removing members of violent street gangs, such as MS-13, sends a clear message to criminal enterprises around the world:  You are not welcome in the United States, and you’ll find no harbor here.
President Trump made it a priority to get these criminals off our streets and, when possible, out of our country.  And that’s exactly what the men and women of ICE are going to do every single day to help keep America safe.
ICE’s Homeland Security Investigation, known as HSI National Gang Unit, leads our efforts along with our deportation officers to identify and arrest gang members while working to dismantle the organizational structure that supports them.
Gang members are involved in a broad range of criminal activity, including murder, extortion, narcotics trafficking, weapons trafficking, human smuggling, and other crimes with a nexus of border security.
Since the beginning of January of this year, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigation has already arrested 3,311 gang members across the country, a — targeted operation.  I’ll speak just about two.
Project New Dawn:  A recent gang surge led by ICE HSI netted 1,378 gang arrests.
Operation Matador — up in New York State:  Since May 9th has netted over 100 gang members and affiliates, the vast majority of MS-13 members.
Make no mistake, organized violent transnational gangs threaten the safety of our communities, not just in major metropolitan areas, but in our suburbs, like Suffolk County in New York, where I’ll be joining the President tomorrow to discuss this very issue.
Let me share just a couple of examples that demonstrate the violence of these criminals.  Recently, two MS-13 members who were juveniles, arrested as part of Operation Matador, have been implicated in a quadruple homicide of four young adults in New York.  An additional MS-13 arrest admitted to be complicit in homicides of two juvenile females.  Multiple other Operation Matador MS-13 arrests have led to admissions on narcotics trafficking, weapons smuggling, and intelligence on other unsolved crimes in the region.
The proliferation of MS-13 remains an ongoing challenge for law enforcement everywhere.  Our efforts to eradicate gangs such as this are much more effective in areas where our partnership with local law enforcement is the strongest.
As I said the last time I was here, I cannot stress enough:  Our operations are more effective when there are strong local partnerships supporting them.  Sanctuary city policies only make it more difficult, if not impossible, for ICE to remove known gang members and other criminal aliens who are removed from this country without the opportunity to commit additional crimes.
As I said when I was here at the podium a month ago:  Cooperation is critical.  It is often state and local law enforcement, not ICE, that first come into contact with transnational gang members.  Together, through partnership, we can keep our streets safe.  Together, our gang is bigger than theirs.
In addition to making our community safer, the intelligence gathered from operations targeting MS-13 helps our agents and investigators continue their efforts to fully dismantle these global criminal enterprises, from the command and control structure in El Salvador to the street members walking our communities, and everybody in between.
In closing I’ll say this:  The progress we’re making would not be possible without the brave and dedicated men and women of ICE.  These are professionals, American patriots, who leave the safety of their homes and their families every day to help keep us safe, to keep people safe they’ll never meet.  And I am honored and proud to represent them here today.
With that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-072717/

2:36 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  It’s that time again, as many of you have probably noticed and I know several of you have asked about, for us to announce where the President will be donating his quarterly salary.
Last quarter, the President’s salary went toward the restoration of two projects at a national battlefield.  After his donation, additional donors quickly stepped up to bring the total gift to over $260,000.
In this quarter, the President will be donating his salary to the Department of Education.  And with that, I would like to bring up Secretary DeVos to tell you about what the department will be doing with the President’s money to help equip the boys and girls who will be the leaders of tomorrow.
Secretary DeVos, it’s my pleasure, on behalf of the President of the United States, to present a check for $100,000 to the Department of Education.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, thank you so much, Sarah.  I want to start by saying how grateful I am to the President for this generous gift.  The President is committed to our nation’s students and to reforming education in America so that every child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a high-quality education.
He and I have had many conversations about how best to put students’ needs first, and ensure we are setting them up for a lifetime of success.  There’s much work to be done, but we are certainly on the right track thanks to the President’s leadership.
Just yesterday, Ivanka Trump and I hosted a summer reading event at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, where the focus was on getting young girls, age six to ten, excited about learning science, technology, engineering, and math.  It was fun to see their eyes light up as they got to explore, create, and experiment in a collaborative environment.
Today’s and tomorrow’s economy requires students prepared for STEM careers.  That’s why we’ve decided to use the President’s second-quarter salary to host a STEM-focused camp for students at the Department of Education.  We want to encourage as many children as possible to explore STEM fields in the hope that many develop a passion for these fields.
We look forward to this exciting endeavor, and I thank President Trump again for this generous gift.  Thanks.
MR. SANDERS:  Thank you, Secretary DeVos.  Thank you for coming and being here for that today.
Now, I know Anthony is probably a little bit disappointed that he’s not up here today, but since he did some TV this morning, he was able to go ahead and get his hair and makeup done, so I think he’ll be okay.  (Laughter.)
As Anthony said when he was up here last week, we’re looking to mix things up a little bit.  From time to time, I’d like to give us all a little reminder of why we’re here every day, which I imagine for most of us is because we love our country and want to help to make it better.
I’ve spent quite a bit of time around the President over the last year and I know exactly why he’s here.  He’s tough, he’s a fighter, he’s a strong leader, and he’s somebody who deeply loves this country.  And he loves its people and he wants to make America great again.
In Washington, it’s often easy to go to work, get lost in the process, and forget why we’re here every day.  The reason we’re here is to serve the American people.  And today I’d like for you to indulge me and let me tell you a little bit about what that means for me.
To the best of my knowledge, I’m the first mom to hold the job of the White House Press Secretary.  That says less about me than it does about this President.  It’s not just with personnel, it’s about people and it’s about policy.  Empowering working moms is at the heart of the President’s agenda, particularly when it comes to things like tax reform.
I have three children, and the oldest, Scarlett, starts kindergarten in a few weeks.  Scarlett and every little girl in America should grow up in a country that if we deliver on the President’s agenda of better jobs, better healthcare, and a better tax system, that incentivizes women to work and raise children.
As a working mom, it’s not lost on me what a great honor and what a privilege it is to stand here at the podium, and I thank the President for the opportunity.  I’ll always do my absolute best to truthfully answer your questions and to deliver the President’s message.
Jonathan, I preempt you from asking that question later.  (Laughter.)
But I also hope to send my daughter a message and to every other kid in America:  Don’t listen to the critics, dream big, and fulfill your potential — because in this country, you still can.
To remind us a little bit more often about some of the forgotten men, women, and children that we’re here to serve and that the President is fighting for, we’re going to start the White House briefing every once in a while with a letter or an email that we may receive from some of those individuals.
To kick it off with that process, I’d like to read you a letter from 9-year-old Dylan:
“My name is Dylan Harbin, but everybody calls me Pickle.  I’m nine years old, and you’re my favorite President.  I like you so much that I had a birthday about you.  My cake was the shape of your hat.”
And then Dylan goes on to ask a few questions:  “How old are you?”  Dylan, President Trump is 71 years old.  “How big is the White House?”  The White House is 168 feet long, it’s 70 feet tall on the south side, and 60 feet, four inches tall on the north, and it takes 300 gallons of white paint to cover the exterior of the White House residence.  It has 132 rooms and approximately 55,000 square feet.  “How much money do you have?”  Dylan, I’m not sure, but I know it’s a lot.
“I don’t know why people don’t like you.”  Me either, Dylan.  “You seem really nice.  Can we be friends?”  I’m happy to say that I directly spoke to the President, Dylan, and he would be more than happy to be your friend.  “My picture is in here.  So, if you can, see me and say hello.”  Dylan, I hope you’re watching, because the President wanted me to personally tell you hello.  “Your friend, Dylan.”
Dylan, thanks for writing to the President.  And if you’re ever in Washington, D.C., I hope you’ll stop by and let us show you around the White House.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.

MS. SANDERS:  Slow news day?  Quiet crowd?  Good afternoon.  To mark the last day of Made in America Week, this afternoon the President will welcome several living survivors of the attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor and their families.
Other events this week have focused mainly on the products and goods bearing that highly esteemed Made in America label.
But truly the most prized thing to have come out of our country have been the brave men and women who have risked their lives protecting the freedom of Americans and our allies around the globe.
And just a few minutes ago at two o’clock, the President signed an executive order that will ensure the men and women of the greatest military in the world have the ships, aircraft, vehicles, and other supplies they will need to keep us safe in the years ahead.
This order commissions the first-ever, whole-government assessment of America’s defense industrial base, marking the first time since President Eisenhower that an American President is investing personal attention into the health of the United States defense industrial base.
President Trump is committed to maintaining the secure supply chains and robust workforce that will support our nation’s heroes for decades to come.
Next week, we’ll be highlighting American heroes like the World War Two veterans, the first responders who keep our communities safe every day, and the boys and girls who will grow up to be the next generation of American leaders.
While I’m on the topic of the men and women who protect us, I also wanted to note that the President commended the House yesterday for voting to reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security for the first time.
The Homeland Security Authorization Act also authorizes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the first time.  Secretary Kelly has already made tremendous progress in fulfilling the President’s promise to end illegal immigration and fully enforce the laws of the United States, and this bill reflects the President’s strong commitment to ensuring that progress continues.
Also on the Hill, of course, Senate Republicans this week continued to work toward our shared goal of saving the American people from the disaster of Obamacare.
Earlier this afternoon, Vice President Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price hosted representatives from several grassroots organizations calling on the Senate to take action on healthcare legislation.
As the President has said, inaction is simply not an option.  These groups want lawmakers to know that their members want them to follow through on their promise to the American people.
Finally I’d like to read a statement from the President on the resignation of Press Secretary Sean Spicer:
“I am grateful for Sean’s work on behalf of my administration and the American people.  I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities:  Just look at his great television ratings.”
Sean will continue to serve the administration through August.
And the President has also appointed Anthony Scaramucci as Communications Director and I have statement on Anthony’s appointment as well:
“Anthony is a person I have great respect for, and he will be an important addition to this administration.  He has been a great supporter and will now help implement key aspects of our agenda while leading the communications team.  We have accomplished so much, and we are being given credit for so little.  The good news is the people get it, even if the media doesn’t.”
And I’d like to bring Anthony up to say a few words and take a few questions.  As always I’ll be back after that to answer any follow-up questions.
MR. SCARAMUCCI:  Thank you, Sarah.  Thank you very much.
So I’m going to be very brief.  I’m going to make my remarks informal and then I’ll take questions from everybody.
First off, I’d like to announce formally that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to the press —","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-white-house-principal-deputy-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-incoming-white-house-communications-director-anthony-scaramucci-072117/

MS. SANDERS:  The second door was already open.  You guys must be ready for me. 
I apologize for the delays.  Good afternoon.  Today, the Trump administration continued to shine a spotlight on the people, products, and principles that have made this country great with an event hosted by Secretary Zinke, celebrating the American outdoor recreation industry. 
The United States has a long tradition of preserving the all-American outdoor experience, dating back to the days of President Theodore Roosevelt.  And we’ve developed a booming industry to support that tradition that employs 7.6 million across the country, building boats and RVs, or supplying campers, fishers, and hunters.
The importance of exploring, innovating, and building here at home has always been a central part of our country’s heritage.  And President Trump is proud that his administration is highlighting its continued significance to both our economy and our culture.
Yesterday, the United States Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, took the next step in renegotiating the outdated and unfair North American Free Trade Agreement by releasing the administration’s negotiating objectives.
President Trump promised the American people, during the campaign, that he would renegotiate NAFTA to get a better deal for our workers, or he would withdraw from the deal.  These objectives are a framework for what the administration sees as a more fair NAFTA — one that maintains the benefits for American farmers and ranchers who have obtained much-needed market access but provides relief for the manufacturing industry that has suffered particularly hard under the current agreement.  
They include addressing the United States’ persistent trade imbalances in North America and obtaining reciprocal market access; eliminating unfair subsidies, market-distorting practices by state-owned enterprises, and burdensome restrictions on intellectual property; updating provisions throughout the agreement to support U.S. manufacturing; expanding market access for U.S. agriculture; adding a digital economy chapter; incorporating and strengthening labor and environment-side agreements; calling for the establishment of appropriate mechanisms to combat currency manipulation; and strengthening trade remedies, including the ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws.  
Politicians have been promising to fix NAFTA for years, but this is the first time that a modern United States free trade agreement has been renegotiated.  USTR will be making an announcement soon on the first round of negotiations as we work towards a NAFTA that benefits all Americans — our workers, farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service providers.
This morning, the Treasury and State Departments took strong action as part of the administration’s broader strategy to keep America safe from the threat of Iran’s destabilizing influence.  The Departments designated several individuals and entities for contributing to that influence.  These actions are separate and on top of the President’s direction to work with our allies to explore options for addressing the serious flaws of the JCPOA.
Even as we continue to work to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, we cannot look away while Iran threatens our country and our allies in ways beyond their nuclear threat.  All of these elements will be part of the comprehensive integrated strategy that the Trump administration is developing to address the full spectrum of Iranian threats to our national interest. 
And, finally, yesterday Sean was asked about the administration’s position on the concept of net neutrality, and he said we’d get back to you.  The administration believes that rules of the road are important for everyone — website providers, Internet service providers, and consumers alike.
With that said, the previous administration went about this the wrong way by imposing rules on ISPs through the FCC’s Title II rulemaking power.  We support the FCC chair’s efforts to review and consider rolling back these rules, and believe that the best way to get fair rules for everyone is for Congress to take action and create regulatory and economic certainty.
And with that, I will take your questions.
Eamon.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-071817/

3:24 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Earlier this afternoon, the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded the confirmation hearing for Chris Wray, the President’s nominee for FBI director.  
During his hearing, Chris Wray continually displayed the strong character, deep knowledge, and moral integrity that make him, as former Democrat Senator Sam Nunn testified, “…the leader the [FBI] needs at this critical moment.”  And the President looks forward to seeing this incredibly qualified nominee move through the Judiciary Committee and be swiftly confirmed by the full Senate.  
Also, on the Hill today, three bills that represent important tools in combatting human trafficking are on the floor of the House for a vote.  H.R. 2200, which reauthorizes $130 million in funding for the prevention of human trafficking, protection of victims, and prosecution of traffickers.  H.R. 2664, which ensures the Department of Labor effectively trains its employees to recognize and respond to the illegal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain.  And, lastly, H.R. 2480, which expands the ability of a DOJ program to enable law enforcement agencies to compete for federal funding, specifically to develop and carry out programs that fight sex trafficking demand.  
President Trump has focused on ending human trafficking, and hopes that these bills will pass the House and move to the Senate quickly so we can continue to fight against this horrific practice.
While the House takes up these critical bills on human trafficking today, the Senate is continuing its work on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.  As I’ve said time and time again, with every day that goes by with this collapsing law still in place, more hardworking Americans see their healthcare options either disappear entirely or become too costly for their families to use. 
The President was elected to protect those American families, and he looks forward to seeing the Senate continue to move toward a solution that works for all Americans during the upcoming weeks.
Also on the Hill, the President was glad to see David Nye confirmed as a U.S. District Judge in Idaho by a vote of 100-0.  It’s unfortunate, though, that this clearly eminently qualified nominee who was reported out of committee by a voice vote faced more than 30 procedural hurdles forced by Senate Democrats before his unanimous vote.  Senate Democrats continue to show the American people that they’d rather play political games with these critical nominations than work with this administration.  As the Majority Leader said, if they continue at this rate, it will take the Senate almost 11.5 years to confirm the remaining presidential appointments.
We’re again calling on Senate Democrats to stop brazenly abusing Senate procedure to hold up the President’s experienced and accomplished nominees so that he can continue his work on behalf of the American people.
We’ve received several inquiries on what the President — on his agenda for the past couple of days, so I’d like to read some of that out before I take your questions.  He’s had multiple meetings with key economic advisors, particularly on issues of trade, such as Ambassador Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross, NEC Director Gary Cohn, and Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, Peter Navarro.  
He’s had multiple meetings on cybersecurity with homeland security advisors, and met separately with his national security team, and a number of meetings with members of his legislative affairs team and the Vice President specifically on healthcare.  Lastly, he had a meeting with his Faith Advisory Board to discuss issues important to the faith community. 
As you all know, later tonight the President will depart for Paris, France for meetings and celebrations with America’s oldest ally.  
Tomorrow, the President will have lunch with American military commanders, after which he will join French President Macron for a tour of the French Military Museum.  After a bilateral meeting with the President, the two leaders will hold a press conference.  And in the evening, President Trump and the First Lady will dine with the President and his wife.
On Friday, the President will attend France’s annual Bastille Day celebration — the first President to do so since 1989.  
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States entry into World War I, the people of France have designated America this year’s national guest of honor.  Troops from the U.S. Army’s 1st Infantry Division, the first unit to arrive on French soil in 1917, will march in the parade, and U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds will conduct a flyover with planes with the French air force.  
And after the parade, the President will return back to the United States.  
On the topic of previous inquiries — because I like to do my best to get back to you — yesterday I received a question from John Gizzi about whether we’d support changing Senate blue slip procedures for judicial nominees.  And the White House is deferring to the Senate on this Senate procedure, and we have multiple highly qualified nominees waiting for Senate hearings, and hope the Senate can start moving them along quickly.
Finally, and lastly, we understand the Chinese hospital treating Nobel Peace Prize laureate and writer, Liu Xiaobo, has invited U.S., German medical experts to China for medical consultations.  We remain concerned that both Mr. Liu and his family are unable to communicate with the outside world and that he is not free to seek the medical treatment of his choosing.  
We continue to call on the Chinese authorities to grant him full parole and to release his wife from house arrest and provide them the protections and freedoms, such as freedom of movement and access to appropriate medical care consistent with Chinese constitution, legal system, and international commitments.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Phil.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-071217/

2:28 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Before we get started, I’d like to bring up Marc Short, the Director of Legislative Affairs, to give an update on how we’re moving the President’s agenda through Congress, particularly on the historic obstruction from Senate Democrats on confirming the President’s incredibly qualified nominees to posts across the federal government. 
After his statement, Marc will take a few of your questions on that topic; and after that, I will be back to answer your other questions.
Thanks.  Marc.
MR. SHORT:  Good afternoon.  This week, the Senate has scheduled a few confirmation votes.  Yet as even The Washington Post has reported, the Senate is conducting the slowest confirmation process in American history.  For the past six months, Senator Schumer has deliberately run an unprecedented campaign of obstruction against the President’s nominees for high-ranking positions in the government. 
Not only are key national security, energy, financial, and regulatory positions left unfilled, procedural slowdowns have kept the Senate committees from doing other legislative work.  
Democrats even walked out of committee hearings to deny a quorum, like school children taking their toys from the playground.  But it’s the American people who are being hurt.  These obstruction tactics are carried out in the name of resisting the Trump administration and playing to a radical left-wing base.  But it’s the will of the American people that is being denied.
As war rages in the Middle East, the Senate hasn’t confirmed many national security appointees.  In fact, the President’s nominee for Under Secretary of Defense, Elaine McCusker, enjoyed bipartisan support as she advanced through committee.  But she has now been waiting since May 23rd for a vote on the Senate floor.
The person responsible for ensuring our national security throughout all foreign investments is still waiting an up or down vote.  Heath Tarbert was voted out of committee on May 23rd and for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has now waited for over a month for a confirmation vote.  
As Americans are anxious to get back to work and get the economy growing again after eight years of stagflation — sorry, stagnation, the nominee to run the President’s Council of Economic Advisers is stuck waiting for approval.  Kevin Hassett again received Democrat support and an endorsement letter from 44 bipartisan economists, some of whom even served in the Obama administration.  He was approved in committee on June 14th and again is still waiting to be confirmed.
The list goes on.  We currently have seven deputy secretaries — to manage entire federal departments — who have been cleared by committee and are waiting for a vote on the Senate floor.  
Folks, it’s July 10th, and we do not have deputy secretaries at the Small Business Administration, the Department of Interior, the Department of Energy, HUD, HHS, OMB, and the Department of Defense.  Senate committees have cleared 32 of our nominees who are still waiting for a floor vote.  
In total, there are 133 nominees waiting for consideration by various committees.  While Senator Schumer irresponsibly champions the resist movement, his partisan tactics are harming the country and obstructing the will of the American people.  
To date, the Senate has confirmed a total of 50 Trump administration nominees.  To put that in perspective, the Senate had confirmed 202 officials at this same point in the Obama administration.  We think that that is a fair analogy because Republicans now control the Senate.  Democrats controlled the Senate at that point.  And the comparison is 50 to 202.  
By the August recess in 2009, the Senate had confirmed 292 Obama administration nominees by voice vote alone.  To date, the Trump administration nominees have received five voice vote confirmations.  
The truth is the Democrats are putting their agenda ahead of the will of the American people.  Democrats are keeping key agency nominees from serving their country.  And today, we’re calling on Senator Chuck Schumer to stop blocking the will of the American people for political gain.  And we’re also calling on you in the media to help shine light to bring this problem to light of day.
The Senate will likely devote this entire week to approving just three well-qualified nominees.  We ask:  Give these critical nominees an up or down vote so they can get to work.

Hamburg, Germany
7:18 P.M. CET
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Hi, everybody.  I just want to highlight very briefly, and then Secretary Tillerson will go on, and then afterwards we’ll both answer a few questions.
But President Trump has had a very, very significant few days.  I think, as you know, we went to Poland on Wednesday.  In Poland, he met with 12 different leaders.  We had bilats with Croatia and with Poland, as well as 10 other leaders at the Three Seas Conference where we talked about energy — the importance of the energy markets, the importance of supplying independent energy, infrastructure and opportunities there.  I think, as you know, the speech which was just incredibly well-received, is part of our “America First But America Not Alone.”
Then coming here, the President has had very significant meetings at the G20 already.  Yesterday, we had the opportunity to meet with Chancellor Merkel and her team.  It was a very, very productive and friendly meeting.  There were lots of areas for us to collaborate on that were very clear.  We talked about economic issues, we talked about trade.  We had a very productive dinner last night — Secretary Tillerson, myself, General McMaster — with President Moon Jae-in and Prime Minister Abe and their teams, discussing the importance of what’s going on in North Korea and the issues there.  And then today we’ve had, already, several other bilats, and tomorrow we have another six.
The President also participated in a very important session today on trade and an important session on the environment and the economy.  So I would just generally say we’ve had very productive economic meetings.  There’s been very substantive issues discussed.  The North Korea issue has been discussed very significantly, about the escalation in North Korea.
And with that, I will turn it over to Secretary Tillerson to talk about his meetings, and afterwards we’ll take some questions.
SECRETARY TILLERSON:  Thank you, Steve, and thanks for staying with us late these evening.
President Trump and President Putin met this afternoon for 2 hours and 15 minutes here on the sidelines of the G20.  The two leaders exchanged views on the current nature of the U.S.-Russia relationship and the future of the U.S.-Russia relationship.
They discussed important progress that was made in Syria, and I think all of you have seen some of the news that just broke regarding a de-escalation agreement and memorandum, which was agreed between the United States, Russia and Jordan, for an important area in southwest Syria that affects Jordan’s security, but also is a very complicated part of the Syrian battlefield.
This de-escalation area was agreed, it’s well-defined, agreements on who will secure this area.  A ceasefire has been entered into.  And I think this is our first indication of the U.S. and Russia being able to work together in Syria.  And as a result of that, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria that we can continue to work together on to de-escalate the areas and violence once we defeat ISIS, and to work together toward a political process that will secure the future of the Syrian people.
As a result, at the request of President Putin, the United States has appointed — and you’ve seen, I think, the announcement of Special Representative for Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker.  Ambassador Volker will draw on his decades of experience in the U.S. Diplomatic Corps, both as a representative to NATO and also his time as a permanent political appointment.
The two leaders also acknowledged the challenges of cyber threats and interference in the democratic processes of the United States and other countries, and agreed to explore creating a framework around which the two countries can work together to better understand how to deal with these cyber threats, both in terms of how these tools are used to in interfere with the internal affairs of countries, but also how these tools are used to threaten infrastructure, how these tools are used from a terrorism standpoint as well.
The President opened the meeting with President Putin by raising the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.  They had a very robust and lengthy exchange on the subject.  The President pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement.  President Putin denied such involvement, as I think he has in the past.
The two leaders agreed, though, that this is a substantial hindrance in the ability of us to move the Russian-U.S. relationship forward, and agreed to exchange further work regarding commitments of non-interference in the affairs of the United States and our democratic process as well as those of other countries.  So more work to be done on that regard.
I’d be happy to take your questions.  You’re going to referee, Sean?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-presidents-meetings-g20-070717/

2:30 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Happy Friday.  I have just a couple things I want to highlight here at the top before we get into questions.  We had another bad Obamacare news piece come out today out of Ohio.  Premier Health Plan is withdrawing from the state’s exchange, leaving 20 more counties with no insurance plans on the Obamacare exchange.  That’s on top of the 14 bare counties in Nevada we talked about yesterday.
For the thousands of Americans now left with no choice when it comes to health insurance, these announcements are more than just words and numbers — it means that they will have to make tough choices when it comes to medical care for themselves and their families.
The President is determined to give these families a better option.  News like this is why it’s so important we repeal this failed law before it collapses completely.
Earlier today, Agriculture Secretary Perry — I’m sorry, Perdue sliced a Nebraska prime rib at a ceremony in China, formally marking the return of American beef to the $2.5 billion Chinese market after a 13-year hiatus.  I strongly encourage you all to take a look at the pictures of the Secretary and representatives from the American and Chinese industries standing around a pretty tasty-looking piece of prime rib, particularly going into this holiday weekend.  This is great news for American ranchers who now have access to the $2.5 billion Chinese beef market.
Also this morning, the Department of Health and Human Services announced approximately $15 million that will be going to women, infants, and their families who have had or are at risk for lead exposure in Flint, Michigan.
President Trump promised during the campaign that he would address Flint’s water crisis quickly and effectively, and his Cabinet is hard at work keeping that promise to the people of Flint.
In the VA, Secretary Shulkin was in New York to unveil the LUKE bionic arm, the world’s most advanced commercial prosthetic that was made possible by VA research.  The LUKE arm is the product of nearly eight years of testing and research, and represents the amazing advances in technology that are possible when the government works in partnership with the private sector to care for our nation’s heroes.
The LUKE arm has the potential to significantly benefit the lives of veterans and others with upper extremity amputations, and the Trump administration was proud to be part of its rollout today.
Finally, yesterday John Gizzi asked if the United States was sending a delegation to the funeral service of the former German chancellor on the 1st of July, and I wanted to give an update, as I said I would get back.  We are sending an official delegation, which will be headed by the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, who is the former United States Ambassador to Germany.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  And, folks, in honor of the Fourth of July, let’s try to save all our fireworks for Tuesday.  (Laughter.)

 2:04 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  I would like to invite Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin up to speak first with all of you and take a few questions regarding a recent announcement on sanctions.  And, as always, I will be back after to answer your questions.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you.  Today, the Trump administration is continuing its efforts against the government of North Korea.  Despite multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions imposing international sanctions, the government of North Korea continues its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Today, Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has found the Bank of Dandong to be a foreign financial institution of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the U.S.A Patriot Act.  This bank has served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The United States will not stand for such action.  This will require U.S. banks to ensure that the Bank of Dandong does not access the U.S. financial system directly or indirectly through other foreign banks.  This action reaffirms the Treasury Department’s commitment to ensure that North Korea is cut off from the U.S. financial system.  
In addition, the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control has sanctioned two individuals and one entity for their continued support of North Korea’s activities.  
While today’s actions are directed at Chinese individuals and entities, we look forward to continuing working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea.  We are in no way targeting China with these actions.  We will be meeting with China and other countries at the G20 next week to further our efforts to cut off North Korea’s illicit activities.
North Korea’s provocative, destabilizing, and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated.  We are committed to targeting North Korea’s external enablers in maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  
And with that, I’d be happy to answer any questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-062917/

2:31 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  Nice crowd.  I know everybody is excited about Energy Week; we certainly are here at the White House.  And that’s why we’ve got Secretary of Energy Rick Perry here to talk to you about what the President and others in the administration are doing all this week to emphasize our commitment to American energy dominance, and he’ll take some of your questions after that.  And, of course, I will be happy to step back up after that and answer questions on other non-energy-related topics.  
SECRETARY PERRY:  We’ll be ecstatic — ecstatic.
MS. SANDERS:  And be nice to him — he’s from Texas.  Not quite Arkansas, but still a good neighbor. 
SECRETARY PERRY:  A good neighbor.
Sarah, thank you.  And my privilege to be here today to share with you a little bit of the observation that I have relative to Energy Week.  This week, the Trump administration will bring together state, tribal, business, labor — all together, one room — happily sitting down and discussing how we’re going to go forward, what the path forward is for U.S. energy dominance.   
And President Trump wants America to achieve energy dominance by utilizing our abundant resources for good, both here and abroad.  And an energy-dominant America means self-reliant, it means a secure nation, free from the geopolitical turmoil of other nations who seek to use energy as an economic weapon.  An energy-dominant America will export to markets around the world, increasing our global leadership and our influence.  
At DOE and across the administration, we’re ending the bureaucratic blockade that has hindered American energy creation.  The United States has been a net energy exporter — excuse me, a net energy importer since 1953, almost as long as I’ve been alive.  But thanks to innovation and technology advancements, we’re on the brink of changing this, and in very important elements of an American energy portfolio.  Ten years ago, people would never have guessed that by 2018 the United States is expected to be a net energy exporter of natural gas.  American companies can and already have exported U.S. LNG to our international trading partners in Europe and Asia.  Unleashing our full energy potential in this country will lead to robust job growth and expansion in every sector of our economy.
This week we will also reaffirm our commitment to clean energy.  That binary choice between pro-economy and pro-environment that has perpetuated — or, I should say, been perpetuated by the Obama administration has set up a false argument.  The fact is, we can do good for both — and we will.  There was one fact missing from the headlines about the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and that is that the United States already leads the world in lowering emissions.  And we’ve done this through innovation and technology, not by signing agreements.  The Paris Agreement put the taxpayer on the hook for a costly deal.  There was a billion dollars already out the door.  Thankfully, this President has the good sense to step in before billions more had been committed.   
We’ve already seen the fruits of innovative, clean technology, like CCUS — carbon capture, utilization and sequestration.  The Petra Nova plant, just on the outskirts of Houston, Texas, uses a process to remove 90 percent of the carbon dioxide after coal is burned to generate energy in a clean way.  Then it uses that captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery.  
Instead of preaching about clean energy, this administration will act on it.  I believe no clean energy portfolio is truly complete without nuclear power, and so does the President.  If you want to see the environment and the climate that we live in affected in a positive way, you must include nuclear energy with zero emissions to your portfolio.  Do it safe, do it thoughtfully, do it economically.  Under the leadership of the United States, the world can benefit from that.
This administration believes that nuclear energy development can be a game-changer and an important player in the development of our clean-energy portfolio globally.  I believe we can achieve this by focusing on the development of technology, for instance, advanced nuclear reactors, small modular reactors. 
Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to advocate for a very broad, all-of-the-above energy portfolio to allow the United States to achieve energy independence, dramatically reducing our trade deficits, and create jobs beyond the 6.4 million Americans who are currently employed in that sector.
We look forward to hearing from Americans this week about how we can best move forward to reduce unnecessary government regulation and bureaucracy to promote jobs and economic growth in the energy sector.  For years, they have been overregulated by Washington politicians and bureaucrats who believed they knew best.  The lecturing is over with, and now it’s time that we listen.

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  I want to say at the top that with respect to the Supreme Court decision on the President’s executive order, the President was honored by the 9-0 decision that allows him to use an important tool to protect our nation’s homeland.
His number-one responsibility as Commander-in-Chief is to keep the American people safe, and that’s exactly what this executive order does.
In terms of next steps, the government is reviewing the decision and determining how to proceed going forward.  The decision obviously just came down a few hours ago, so we’ll probably have further guidance for you as it becomes available.  In the meantime, I would suggest you reach out to the Department of Justice as they — as details become available.
The Supreme Court also today handed down its own decision in the Trinity Lutheran case.  That was a 7-2 decision, which is a significant victory for religious liberty and an affirmation of the First Amendment right of all Americans.  
The Court recognized there’s a clear difference between the government supporting a particular religion and the government simply treating all people the same — fairly — regardless of their religion.
This ruling reaffirms that the government cannot discriminate against individuals or organizations simply because they or their members hold religious beliefs.  The President believes that America is stronger when people of faith and their organizations can exercise their religion freely, and he’s pleased with today’s ruling.
In terms of the rest of the schedule this week, it’s going to be extremely busy and action-packed leading up to the July 4th weekend, and the President’s subsequent trip to Poland and the G20.
This week we’re going to wrap up a month-long focus on American jobs with a week dedicated to American energy.  President Trump is committed to utilizing our abundant domestic energy resources both to create jobs here at home and to strengthen America’s global influence and leadership abroad.
Today, energy is going to be a key topic of discussion when the President meets with the Prime Minister of India, including how important our strategic energy partnership and how American energy will help fuel India’s growth and development.
In addition to their statements in the Rose Garden, we’re adding a pool spray at the top of their dinners this evening.  And later this week we’ll have an important announcement on the President’s agenda in terms of how it will help establish American energy dominance.
Of course, it’s also a big week for healthcare with an anticipated vote in the Senate later this week on the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.  The Trump administration is holding events around the country highlighting the failure of Obamacare and what that failure has cost American families.  From the 6.5 million Americans who paid a penalty to the IRS instead of buying an unaffordable product that didn’t meet their needs, to the people in states like Utah, where Secretary Price is today, and where premiums have increased an average of $1,900 since 2013.  
The Secretary has a great op-ed in the Deseret News today that I would encourage you all to take a look at. 
After a small-business roundtable in Utah with some of those who have been shouldering the burden of Obamacare for both themselves and their employees, Secretary Price will travel to Texas and participate in another listening session with physicians in Dallas.
In Washington today, the Vice President and Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Administrator Seema Verma will be hosting a listening session here at the White House focused on the adverse effects of Obamacare on families and individuals with disabilities.  Many of the participants include families who support children with disabilities, as well as those who have been left with no choice when insurers fled their states’ Obamacare exchanges.
According to recent reports, roughly 41 percent of counties could have only one insurer on the exchanges next year, which is up from roughly about 33 percent with one insurer this year.  And there will be 47 counties as of now that have no insurer on the exchange at all.
Washington has been ignoring the struggles of families for these — like these for too long.  And the faster that we can repeal and replace Obamacare, the faster that we can ensure that they and the millions of other Americans who are paying the real price of this failed law get the help that they need.
Healthcare is making a lot of the headlines on the Hill and in Congress, but there’s also important work being moved forward in fulfilling the promise to crack down on sanctuary cities.  The House is expected to vote on two bills towards the end of this week which are major priorities of the President.
The first — the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act — would prevent states and localities that refuse to follow federal law and cooperate with immigration authorities from receiving certain grants from both the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.  Those funds would instead be granted to states and localities that are in compliance with federal law.
And the second is Kate’s Law, which is named in honor of Kate Steinle, which would increase the mandatory penalties for aliens who illegally reenter the United States with stronger penalty increases for those who have been previously convicted of a crime.  This is an issue that should unite all Americans in both major parties.
Over 80 percent of the American people support this common-sense, mainstream approach.  These measures also represent an essential tool in the fight to dismantle the dangerous MS-13 cartel, and is widely supported by law enforcement. 
We fully expect these bills to move through Congress and look forward to the President signing them both.  
With that, I’m glad to take a few questions.

MR. SPICER:  I want to start with some good news.  We continue to see great progress by Congressman Steve Scalise, but additionally, it’s great to note that just a few minutes ago George Washington Hospital has announced that Mike Mika, who was also involved in that shooting, has been upgraded to good condition.  So we continue to keep an eye on the situation and wish him a speedy recovery on his way to getting out of the hospital.  And so that’s a great way to start this.
Back to business here.  This morning, after a series of meetings with Secretary of State Tillerson, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, the President was honored to sign the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act surrounded by a group of our nation’s great veterans and their brave families.
As we all know, the VA scandals exposed unacceptably long wait times for our nation’s veterans and issues with tracking their care.  In response, Congress passed the Veterans Access Choice and Accountability Act in 2014, which has since brought many more instances of poor performance and misconduct by the VA to light.
The bill the President signed this morning further empowers Secretary Shulkin and the VA to protect our veterans from this kind of misconduct in the future.  It’s one part of the President’s comprehensive plan to modernize the VA so that it gives the veterans the care, treatment and support that they so richly deserve.
Back in March, many of you may remember they signed the Veterans Choice Improvement Act so that more veterans can see the doctor of their choice and they don’t have to travel long distances or wait for care.  Already under the Choice program, this year, veterans have received 42 percent more approvals to see a doctor that they have chosen.  And he signed an executive order in April creating the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within the VA to hold employees who fail our veterans accountable.  At the same time, this office rewards and retains the many VA employees who do a fantastic job and it protects the honest employees who expose wrongdoing.
At the signing, he called on Congress to pass legislation then that he signed this morning with Secretary Shulkin to give the authority he needed to best protect those who protect us.  Since taking the reins at the VA, Secretary Shulkin has carried through a thorough review to uncover all of the problems and challenges it inherited from the previous administration.  He’s imposed new standards of accountability and transparency, and just this month he announced that the VA will finally sync up its medical records with the Department of Defense so that veterans will be treated as a single patient across the system, a long-overdue step, giving them the seamless care that they deserve throughout their service and beyond.
As he said many times, the President cares deeply about the men and women who have served our country, and he was glad to sign the VA Accountability Act this morning that takes another step toward shaping the VA into a department that is truly worthy of our veterans.
Also this morning, the Department of Justice expressed its full support for Texas’s efforts towards improving public safety by mandating that statewide — towards improving — by mandating statewide cooperation with federal immigration laws that require the removal of illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.  The President has made a commitment to keep America safe, and Texas’s SB4 law is critical to maintaining cooperation from state and local enforcement partners in that mission.
The federal government must have the proper assistance from state and local authorities to effectively enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe.  And that’s, frankly, what Texas’s law does.  Given the strong federal interest in facilitating this cooperation, the Trump administration is glad to be putting its full support behind Texas’s effort.
As he said yesterday, the President is very supportive of the draft Senate healthcare bill, which represents the next step in repealing and replacing Obamacare.  It’s time to — for all Republicans to unite and fulfill this promise that we’ve been talking about for over seven years, and that we would rescue them from the mess that they — was created by imposing a risky healthcare experiment on our country several years ago.
With costs rising and options dwindling, it’s clear that the risk that we were given didn’t pay off.  Just ask the people of New Hampshire, where another insurer just announced that it will stop offering insurance on the state’s Obamacare exchange.  The President and his entire team will be looking forward to working with all senators who are willing to come to the table to amend, finalize and pass the bill so that we can deliver a world-class healthcare system in place of the failing system that we have now.
And with that, let’s get into some questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-062317/

 MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Before I get into what the President is going to continue to do to advance the Tech Week that we started, I wanted to shine a spotlight on two of the President’s biggest legislative priorities right now — tax reform and repeal and replace of Obamacare.
By the end of the day, both the Vice President and the Speaker of the House will have both delivered remarks at the National Association of Manufacturers about why it’s so critical that we come together and quickly deliver significant tax reform to the American people.  Simplifying and updating our overly complicated tax system is one of the most impactful ways that we can create jobs and strengthen our economy.  And I think that’s something that everyone in this town can probably agree upon.
There’s also major agreement between the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress on what any significant tax reform package must include.  And frankly, I saw some of the Democrats earlier today, and I think there are some that share those general philosophies as well.  We want to make it easier for companies to sell American goods abroad and turn that success into jobs here at home.  
I think we all will recognize that what I think every American also agrees with, which is that we need to simplify our tax code.  Depending on the estimates you look at, taxpayers and businesses spend anywhere between 6 billion to almost 9 billion hours complying with the IRS’s requirements.  And those are, frankly, billions of hours that they’re not building things, growing businesses, buying goods and services from other American businesses, spending time with their families, pursuing a personal hobby.  And we must reduce that unnecessary burden in terms of both the burden and the time.
Perhaps most importantly, we also agree that we need to get this done sooner rather than later.  That’s why we’re working hand-in-hand with House and Senate leadership and hosting regular listening sessions with outside stakeholders — like the one that’s being conducted currently in the Roosevelt Room here at the White House — with trade associations from the tech industry to iron out details and get their input on what needs to happen.
We’re also committed to seeing the repeal and replace of Obamacare through Congress.  Obviously the Senate is where the action is right now.  This week is the deadline for insurers to commit to selling plans on the Obamacare exchange during the upcoming enrollment period.  And unfortunately, we’re continuing to see signs of its complete failure as data from more and more states comes in.
Last Friday, the New Mexico Health Connections, one of only five remaining of the 23 co-ops nationwide that was created by Obamacare, proposed hiking its rates by nearly 80 percent.  And just today in Iowa, where the President will be traveling tomorrow, the only insurer left in the Obamacare exchange proposed a 43 percent rate hike for next year.
With almost every day that passes, another insurer either leaves the market or raises its rates by double digits.  The American people can’t afford to front the bill for this failed law a single day longer.  It’s time to repeal and replace Obamacare, as Republicans have promised for a while.
Looking ahead this week, Tech Week, as I mentioned at the front, continues, following on a very productive set of meetings and working groups with some of the country’s biggest CEOs yesterday.  The President will visit Cedar Rapids, Iowa tomorrow, where he’ll see firsthand the transformative power of technological innovations in agriculture at Kirkwood Community College.  Kirkwood’s agriculture science program is a national leader and widely recognized as a center for innovation in the ag sector.
And on Thursday, we’re bringing two emerging technologies to the White House that have the potential to revolutionize our economy — drones and universal broadband.  The President will see demonstrations of how these technologies will contribute to the 21st century economy and how the government can ensure that their safe adoption leads to the best possible outcomes for the American worker and American businesses.
With that, I’ll take some questions.

1:43 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Good afternoon.  I hope you guys had a chance to get a little rest this weekend.  As I’m sure you can tell, the President, as well as the rest of the administration, have a very busy week and agenda moving forward at meetings, events, both inside and outside of Washington.
And with that, I’d like to bring up Secretary Shulkin to talk with you all about the big announcement he made this morning about a historic modernization of the VA’s medical records system.  And as a reminder, as always, I would encourage you to please be respectful and keep your questions on the topic at hand, and I will be happy to answer questions on other topics after.
Secretary Shulkin.
SECRETARY SHULKIN:  Thank you, Sarah.  And I’m glad to be here today.  As Sarah said, earlier today I made an announcement about the Department of Veterans Affairs decision on electronic health records.  And normally that’s not too exciting a decision about a product, but I have to tell you I’m very excited about this because I think this is going to make a big difference for veterans everywhere, and it’s going to make a big difference for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
I wanted to say from the outset that when the President selected me to be Secretary, he made clear to me that he expected us to act with faster decisions, to act like a business, and to really make sure that we were doing the right thing to change veterans’ healthcare.  And that’s exactly what we’re trying to do today.
I had told you when I was here last week I was going to make a decision by July 1st, and I wanted to let you know that we’re coming back early and that I’m honoring that commitment.  
And so having an electronic health record that can follow a veteran during the course of his health and treatment is one of the most important things I believe you can do to ensure the safety and the health and wellbeing of a veteran.  So that’s why this is so important.
I told Congress recently that I was committed that VA would get out of the software development business; that I did not see a compelling reason why being in the software development business was good for veterans.  And because of that, I made a decision to move away from our internal product to an off-the-shelf commercial product.  
As you may know, almost all of our veterans get to us from one place, and that’s the Department of Defense.  And when I went back and looked at this issue very carefully since becoming Secretary, I was able to trace back at least 17 years of congressional calls and commission reports requesting that the VA not only modernize its system but work closer with the Department of Defense.  So that went all the way back to 2000.
But actually, to this date, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have gone separate ways.  We each have separate systems, and each are supporting separate electronic systems.  And while we’ve been able to advance interoperability at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayers, today we still have separate systems that do not allow for the seamless transfer of information. 
And I just want to expand on that a little bit being a doctor.  What we are able to do with the Department of Defense over years and years and, as I said, hundreds of millions of dollars, we’re able to reach each other’s records right now.  That’s called interoperability.  Or at least that’s our certification.  But what you’re not able to do is actually work together to plan a treatment, to be able to go back and forth between the Department of Defense and VA.  And so we’ve not been able to obtain that to this point.
And so for those reasons, I decided that VA will adopt the same electronic health record as the Department of Defense, so we will now have a single system.  That system is known as the MHS GENESIS system, which, at its core, is Cerner Millennium.
The adoption of the same system between VA and DOD is going to allow all patient data to reside in a common system so you will have this seamless link between the departments without the manual or electronic exchange of information. 
So as Secretary, I think I’m not willing to put this decision off any longer; I think 17 years has been too long.  When DOD went through its decision on electronic medical records and its acquisition process in 2014, it took them approximately 26 months to do this.  And I will tell you, in government terms, that’s actually a pretty efficient process.  I don’t think we can wait that long when it comes to the health of our veterans.
And so under my authority as the Secretary of VA, I am acting to essentially do a direct acquisition of the EHR currently being deployed by the Department of Defense that will be across the entire VA enterprise.  That’s going to allow the seamless healthcare for veterans and the qualified beneficiaries.
Once again, because of the health of our veterans, I’ve decided that we’re going to go directly into the DOD process for the next generation electronic health record.
Let me just tell you, this is the start of the process.  VA has unique needs that are different than the Department of Defense’s.  And for that reason, VA — while it’s adopting an identical EHR to DOD — needs additional capabilities to maximize interoperability with our community providers.  As you know, one-third of our healthcare goes outside the VA into the community.  And this is critical that we can have the same interoperability with our community providers.
We’re going to have our VA clinicians very involved in how we develop this system and how we implement it.  Because in many ways, the Department of Veterans Affairs is actually well ahead of the Department of Defense in clinical IT innovation, and we’re not going to discard all the things that we’ve done in the past.  And in fact, that’s how we’re going to help DOD get better.  So this is a system that’s going to strengthen care for veterans and our active servicemembers.
We’re going to be embarking upon something that’s never been done before — that is an integrated product, using the DOD platform, but it’s going to require this integration with other vendors to create a system for veterans so that they can get care both in the community as well as in the Department of Defense.  That’s going to take the active cooperation of many companies and thought leaders, and it will serve as a model not only for the federal government, of federal agencies working together, but for all of healthcare that is trying to seek this type of interoperability.
Once again, I want to thank the President for his incredible commitment to helping our veterans and support the VA.  And I also want to thank the Department of Defense, who have been incredibly helpful in this process, and the American Office of Innovation, who has been incredibly helpful in helping us think differently about how to solve problems.

1:41 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  EPA Administrator Pruitt is here today to deliver a brief statement on the President’s announcement yesterday and answer any questions you have regarding the Paris Climate Accord and the decision the President reached yesterday.  As always, I ask that you keep your questions for Administrator Pruitt on topic.  Once he’s finished I’ll be back up here to answer some questions of the day.  I would note that he has a flight to head to, so we’re going to try to keep this relatively short on his end.
With that, Administrator Pruitt.
ADMINISTRATOR PRUITT:  Thanks, Sean.
It’s good to be with you this afternoon.  And I want to first begin by saying that the President made a very courageous decision yesterday on behalf of America.  He put America’s interest first with respect to environmental agreements and international discussions.  I really appreciate his fortitude.  I really appreciate his leadership in this matter.
The discussion over the last several weeks has been one of a thoughtful deliberation.  He heard many voices, voices across a wide spectrum of vantage points.  And the President made a very informed and, I think, thoughtful and important decision for the country’s benefit.
What we have to remember when it comes to the environmental agreements and international agreements with respect to things like the Paris Agreement is we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country.  We have reduced our CO2 footprint to levels of the early 1990s.  And in fact, from 2000 to 2014, we reduced our carbon footprint by over 18 percent.  And that’s been largely accomplished through innovation and technology, not government mandate.  So when we look at issues like this, we are leading with action and not words.
I also want to say that exiting Paris does not mean disengagement.  In fact, the President said yesterday that Paris represents a bad deal for this country; it doesn’t mean that we’re not going to continue the discussion.  To export our innovation, to export our technology to the rest of the world, to demonstrate how we do it better here is, I think, a very important message to send.
He indicated that he’s going to either reenter Paris or engage in a discussion around a new deal with a commitment to putting America first.  The President said, routinely, he’s going to put the interest of American citizens at the head of this administration.  That’s in trade policy; that’s in national security; that’s in border security; that’s in right-sizing Washington, D.C.  And he did that with respect to his decision yesterday on Paris.
So, with that, I’d be glad to answer any questions you might have.  And I don’t know your names, so you’ll have to give me that.  I’ll just point to you, and we’ll just go from there.
Yes, ma’am.  Your name?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-epa-administrator-scott-pruitt-060217/

6098,Trump,2017-05-31 06:31:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
11:31 A.M. EDT
SECRETARY SHULKIN:  ** everybody.  So a few weeks ago, the President came over to my offices at VA at his 100-day mark to talk about the recognition of the progress we’ve had at VA.  So I thought it only fitting at my 100 days to come to his house to talk about what’s happening at VA.
And as you know, the President is so committed to fixing issues for veterans that what he has told me is, is that it is important that we be open and candid and transparent about where the problems are; that as a businessman, the only way to fix the issues in an organization is if you come out and you talk about what those problems are.  And so, as you know, I’m a doctor and I like to diagnose things, assess them and treat them.  And so what you’re going to hear today is really a candid assessment of where our problems are in VA, with the focus of a businessman and the skills of a doctor to be able to actually help you with that.
And as you know, many of these challenges I’m going to talk about today have been decades in building and they’ve spanned multiple administrations.  And this is the time for us to really address these chronic problems that have affected veterans and, in many ways, have harmed veterans and their families by not dealing with these issues.  So I’m going to tackle these issues heads-on.
Just to give you a sense about what we’re doing today, I’m going to talk about 13 areas of significant risk for VA.  It’s going to take about 25 minutes to get through, so if you need to get up and stretch, or if you have ADD and you need to leave, I will not be offended.  But I just want to give you a sense about that.
We’ve had 137 different assessments and studies telling VA what’s wrong and how to fix it.  And what we’ve done in my first 100 days is to go through these studies — the Commission on Care, Independent Assessment, as well as our own internal assessments — to come up with these 13 areas of risk that I want to share.  So let me start with them.
The very first area is access.  And of course, as you know, we started with our wait time issue in 2014 — the real crisis that began recently at VA.  So here’s my assessment on access.  We’ve done a significant job in improving access to care for clinically urgent veterans, so people with clinically urgent needs are now being addressed in a much more efficient way.  We’ve developed same-day services in every one of our 168 medical centers for primary care and mental health.  And in fact, today, over 22 percent of veterans are seen on a same-day basis.
What we’ve done recently is we’ve posted our wait times for every single one of our medical centers across the country in a public forum for everybody to see what’s good and what’s not good in terms of wait times.  There is no other health system in the country that has done anything like that, and there is no comparison to what the VA is doing in terms of transparency and wait times.  Yet veterans are waiting 60 days or more for new appointments in primary care and mental health at 30 of our locations nationwide.  So we still have more to do.
And while, as I mentioned, we’ve done well with meeting the urgent needs of veterans, 10 percent of the time when a provider wants a follow-up appointment in a specific time frame, we’re not meeting that provider’s clinically assessed time for a veteran to come back.  And that’s something we have to address.
Sixteen percent of our primary care clinics are over 100-percent capacity.  When that happens we can’t fully meet their needs in terms of access to care.  Ten percent of our out-patient centers do not offer same-day services today.  Now, we are committing by the end of this year that all of our out-patient centers will offer same-day services in primary care mental health.  But today 10 percent are not meeting that.
The second category is paying providers when veterans go out into the community.  And as you know, our Choice Program, our community care program, has provided increased access for millions of veterans.  And we have 500,000 community care providers — doctors and others — out in the community who participate in our network.  But providers are increasingly frustrated with the VA’s ability to get them payments, to the point that some of them are actually leaving our network.  And that’s obviously working against us.
It takes more than 30 days to process 20 percent of our clean claims at VA, and that affects about 25,000 providers across the country.  In addition, we have about $50 million in out-patient bill charges that are six months or older.  As of April this year, only 65 percent of our claims are handled electronically.  That’s far below what you’d find in the private sector.  And so we need private sector help in order to find new solutions to get that number well above 65 percent, so we can have faster adjudication of payments to our community providers.
The third area is community care in general.  Though we made a lot of progress with our Choice Program — because we’ve had over 70 amendments or modifications to our original contract — we still have eight separate programs for paying community care.  That just makes it too complex and it’s confusing veterans and our employees alike.
In terms of the complexity of this program — it results in VA rejecting one out of five community care claims — the rules are so complex, people are so confused, 20 percent of our claims are rejected.  And that’s much higher that what you’d find in the private sector.  And we need Congress to help us fix those eight separate programs and put them into a single program.
In terms of our Choice Program, we still, today, only have three Department of Defense facilities that participate in the Choice network.  And we need to get the Department of Defense and VA to make all their facilities and our facilities open to veterans and to active service members.
We certainly have to work with Congress and our veteran service organizations to redesign this Choice Program.  It will expire essentially at the end of the year, and we need new legislation — this Congress — to make sure that veterans don’t go back to waiting longer than they need to wait to get care in the community.  So we have to pass legislation this year.
The next area is quality — quality of care in the VA.  We’ve shared with you our star rating systems.  We now publish that on our websites, and we also now publish quality of care comparisons between VAs and local community hospitals.  And in that, we’ve identified 14 of our VAs that have one-star ratings.  That means that their quality is below the standard in the community.  And so that’s not acceptable to us.  We’re deploying teams and implementing performance plans for each of those facilities.
Veterans shouldn’t have to accept low-quality care and they deserve our very best.  I think everybody agrees with that.  And when they’re not getting the best that they can get in the VA, and the community offers better, that’s what we’re going to work to do in a revised Choice Plan, is to allow them to go out into the community if they’re not getting the very best care.
The next area is disability claims and appeals.  We have, currently, over 90,000 disability claims that are taking more than 125 days to process.  Our goal is to cut that in half over the next two years.  But 90,000-plus is too many to be acceptable.
Last week, we processed a claim for disability in three days.  That’s called a due process, called a decision-ready claim.  And we’re going to be introducing decision-ready claims nationwide on September 1st of 2017.  And in addition to that, we’re going to be going paperless throughout all of our veterans’ benefit offices by mid-2018.
So we are focused on not doing claims fast enough now, but we have plans to get much better.  In addition, it’s very hard for a veteran to get information on where their claim status is, and we need to make that process more transparent.
In appeals, it takes almost three years, if you were to file an appeal today, to get a decision.  And it’s going to take Congress to help us fix that system.  I’m grateful that the House passed appeals legislation last week, and we need our friends in the Senate to act on appeals legislation as soon as possible.
Information technology.  We have 20 of our facilities that have out-of-date systems for IT and inventory.  And that makes it very, very difficult for doctors and nurses to get the supplies that they need to care for veterans.  This is what we saw in the Washington, D.C. VA several weeks ago.
We’ve taken immediate steps to begin to start fixing these inventory systems, and we’re executing on those plans.  Currently, 75 percent of our IT budget is just maintenance and sustaining our infrastructure, because our legacy systems are old and are at risk of failing.  And that would cripple our operations.  Our scheduling systems and our financial systems are outdated, and that contributes to these excess wait times.  Both systems are in the process of being replaced, but it’s going to take years to complete that.
We have a system called VALERI, which is the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface.  It’s out of date.  Without funding for a new system, VA is going to have to revert to a paper-based, manual system for electronic loans — or for loans that are going to reduce the number of veterans that we serve, from 90,000 per year to only 12,000 per year.  So we can’t afford to let that happen, because veterans could be at risk of foreclosure or even homelessness, and that’s a risk that we’ve identified.
We have to modernize all of our IT systems to make them commercially viable and cloud-based solutions to the maximum extent possible.  And I’ve committed to making a decision on VA’s electronic medical record in the very near future — definitely before July of this year was my commitment — that I will talk about how we are going to move forward with the new EMR strategy.
Capital assets.  Our buildings and our facilities are increasingly fallen into disrepair.  We have a facility condition assessment report that identified $18 billion would be required to fully remediate our buildings now, including structural/seismic and electrical/mechanical improvements that need to be done.
On average, our buildings are more than 60 years old, with only half being built since 1920.  We have 449 buildings from the Revolutionary War and the Civil War; of those, about 96 are vacant.  We have another 591 buildings that were built in World War I era, which 141 are vacant.  In all, VA has 400 vacant buildings and 735 under-utilized facilities, and that costs the taxpayers $25 million a year just to maintain vacant and under-utilized facilities.
So we need to be able to act quickly.  VA currently has 27 facility leases that we’re waiting for Congress to authorize.  That would provide 2.3 million square feet of needed space for 3.2 million additional clinic visits a year that today we can’t do because we need authorization from Congress.
We need different types of strategic partnerships to be able to bring the type of facilities that we need to veterans, and that means working with local government, with academic affiliates, other federal agencies, and private sector partnerships.  We’re going to work with Congress to develop a modernization plan for our capital infrastructure through what we call a National Realignment Strategy that’s going to allow us to use our buildings in a better way, stop supporting vacant buildings and underutilized buildings, all to be a better steward of taxpayer dollars.
Construction.  Eleven of our major construction projects, totaling $1.4 billion, are on hold because the VA and the U.S. Corps of Engineers still are trying to work through very difficult processes and interpretation of the appropriation rules.  We’re waiting for congressional approval on a joint proposal to move forward, which would allow these projects to go ahead.
The VA’s major construction and minor construction programs have large, unobligated balances.  We carry at VA $971 million in minor construction in unobligated balances, and $2.6 billion in major construction.  VA is taking way too long to make construction awards, and these obligations are critical for us to meet facility demands in the future.
Accountability.  Under current VA law, VA has to wait at least a month to hold an employee accountable for misconduct or poor performance.  We currently have 1,500 disciplinary actions that are pending, meaning people that either need to be fired, demoted, suspended without pay, for violating our core values — and we’re waiting for each of those actions.
Our accountability processes are clearly broken.  We have to wait more than a month to fire a psychiatrist who was caught on camera watching pornography using his iPad while seeing a veteran.  The expedited senior executive removal authority that was given to us in the Choice Program isn’t working.  We weren’t able to utilize that because of constitutionality issues.  Because of the way the judges review these cases, they can force us to take terrible managers back who have been fired for poor performance.  We recently saw that in one of our executives in San Juan.
Just last week, we were forced to take back an employee after they were convicted no more than three times for DUI and had served a 60-day jail sentence.  Under current law, it takes us 51 days from the date management proposes to suspend, demote, or remove an employee until the date that action takes effect.
Despite the limitations of the existing law, we’ve recently removed the Washington, D.C. medical director from their position and other employees there as well due to their failure of leadership.  We removed the medical center director in Shreveport, Louisiana, and three other senior executives for misconduct or poor performance.  And the President signed an executive order that created an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection that reports directly to me as Secretary.
But that isn’t enough.  We need new accountability legislation and we need that now.  The House, again, has passed this and we’re looking forward to the Senate considering this.  But we need that type of action.
Staffing — currently it takes, on average, 110 days to onboard a nurse in the VA, and 177 days to onboard a nurse practitioner.  That’s just too long.  VA doesn’t have a position management system, so it’s very difficult for us to track what jobs are open.  And an organization our size needs that in order to meet the needs of our veterans and have the right resources for them.  We’re going to establish a fully functioning management manpower office by December of this year, which is a first step in a position management system to be established.
Low salaries for many of our healthcare providers and prosthetic professionals make it difficult to recruit and retain the best professionals.  In 2016, the mean salary for a biomedical engineer in the country is $85,620.  The national average for biomedical engineers in the VA is $65,677, or 25 percent below the private sector.  For mechanical engineers, the difference between private sector and VA is $15,000 a year, or 18 percent, where VA is below the national average.  If we can’t compete with private sector salaries, we’re going to be unable to retain qualified providers and support staff.
To help with these shortages, we’re pursuing legislation that would expand graduate medical education training opportunities to be able to train more health professionals to stay in the VA system.  And we’re working with the unified services university — the medical school of the military — to train more medical students who then would serve in the VA for 10 years after their education.
Bureaucracy.  Our central office in VA has grown too big and is too bureaucratic.  We need faster, clearer decision-making and authority that’s going to give veterans more control of their services and care.  I’ve directed the VA Central Office to remain under a hiring freeze as we consolidate program offices.  We have 140 program offices.  I’ve directed them to implement shared services so that they don’t replicate common corporate services.  And that is a result that I plan to achieve of a 10 percent reduction in overhead.
In addition, we’ve been reducing burdensome regulations to make VA more effective.  Effective immediately, VA will stop requiring the use of small-house design guides for future state home grants.  In other words, we’re going to stop using federal rules.  We’re going to allow the states to use their own requirements to build veterans homes in the future in the states.  That’s going to save taxpayer dollars while increasing access to veterans.
A few weeks ago, we announced the VA is removing the more restrictive guidelines for a mammography for women and instead adopting the American Cancer Society mammography guidelines that will allow women veterans more access to care.  We’re restructuring our caregiver regulations to get services to veterans and make it less burdensome to get help from caregivers.
Our vets.gov website is making it possible for veterans to get better access to our services.  At this time last year, only 10 percent of benefits applications were done online.  And because of our vets.gov website consolidating this, we now have eight times that number online a year later.  Over 200,000 veterans have applied for health benefits using vets.gov.
VA will be soft-launching the White House Veterans Complaint Hotline tomorrow, on June 1st.  This is something the President had talked about.  We’re going to be testing that system, starting tomorrow, and fine-tuning it over the next several months, with the goal of it being fully operational by August 15th.  The soft launch of this, which is being worked out tomorrow, will be active — the phone number is (855)948-2311 — and the full launch of that, as I said, will be August 15th.
Fraud, waste, and abuse.  Detecting fraud, waste, and abuse — it’s very important we get resources to veterans and their families.  We’ve been identifying preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.  Already we’ve been able to prevent $27 million in fraudulent payments and duplicate payments in fiscal year 2016.  However with centralized oversight, I know we can do much more than that.  That’s why I stood up the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Initiative.
I recently announced a Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Prevention and Advisory Committee and we’re creating that committee — it’s actually ahead of schedule.  We’re going to be naming co-chairs.  I can name today one of those co-chairs — Shantanu Agrawal, who is the president and CEO of the National Quality Foundation, with a heavy background in fraud, waste, and abuse.  We’ll be naming the second co-chair very soon.
Veteran Suicides.  And this is the last of the assessments.  Though all of the risks that I’ve talked about are troubling to me and require immediate attention, nothing is more important to me than making sure that we don’t lose any veterans to suicide.  As you know, 20 veterans a day are dying by suicide.  That should be unacceptable to all of us.  This is a national public health crisis, and it requires solutions that not only VA will work on but all of government and other partnerships in the private sector, nonprofit organizations.
I authorized emergency mental health services for those that were less than honorably discharged just a few months ago.  That is a population of veterans that is at very high risk for suicide.  And that’s just the beginning.  This summer, we’re going to launch a new initiative called Getting to Zero to help us end veteran suicide.  And again, that’s my top clinical priority.
So, in closing, I just wanted to reaffirm the President’s strong commitment to fixing VA and making VA work better for veterans.  That’s a commitment that I share.  I wanted to come out and to talk about these 13 areas, our assessment of where the problems are.  I want to be held accountable to fix this.  I’m going to need help to fix it from Congress and from other organizations.  But this is our commitment to finally address these problems that have been plaguing VA, sometimes for decades.
The President, the Vice President, Congress, veteran services organizations all share this goal to help modernize the VA.  And that’s why I’m confident that we can turn VA into the type of organization that veterans and families deserve, and all of us want to see.  I appreciate your attention.  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-veterans-affairs-david-shulkin-053117/

DIRECTOR MULVANEY:  Good morning.  I wanted to make a brief statement before we start about things that are probably more important than the numbers.  And folks like me sometimes get caught up in the numbers.  I want to talk very briefly about what happened in Manchester, England.
The President this morning summed it up emotionally for a lot of us who just called these people who perpetrated this — the one person, there may be more — “evil losers.”  The President has — I think Barron is 11 or 12.  I took my son to his first concert when he was 11 or 12.  And I think all of us who have children that age and take them to concerts, this is something that hits especially close to home.
And we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our ally and our friends in the UK, and also have the victims and their families in our hearts as we talk about these other things that somehow pale in comparison.
With that said, let’s talk about the budget.  And I know that some of you were here yesterday, and some of what I’ll say at the opening will be a repeat.  But a lot of folks were not here.  So let’s talk about what this is.
This is the President’s FY2018 Budget.  The name on the cover is “The New Foundation for American Greatness.”  As I read through it over the weekend, as I did — in fact, we’ve been working on this since before I actually got here — it struck me that the title should have been different; that the title should have been, “A Taxpayer First Budget.”  Because that’s what this is.
And as I was trying to reconcile those two things — well, it’s called the “New Foundation for American Greatness,” but I wanted to call it the “Taxpayer First Budget,” that it struck me that that was what was really new, or one of the things that was new about this budget; that we looked at this budget through the eyes of the people who are actually paying the bills.
I think for years and years we’ve simply looked at a budget in terms of the folks who are on the back end of the programs, the recipients of the taxpayer money, and we haven’t spent nearly enough time focusing our attention on the people who pay the taxes.
I got a couple questions yesterday — I know I will today — about compassion.  Compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation.  Yes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds, but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it.  And that is one of the things that is new about this President’s budget.
What else is new?  It’s new in that it balances for the first time in at least 10 years.  The last time we looked, we couldn’t find a President Obama budget that balanced ever.  I think he tried a couple times to convince us that primary balance, which was balance without regard for interest payments on the debt, was balanced.  We reject that.  We get to an actual balance on this budget within the 10-year window.
It begins to reduce the size of the debt relative to the size of the economy in year one, okay?  That’s how important it was and is to this President to try and bring some fiscal discipline.
Again, if you’re looking through the perspective of the people who pay, you’d like to be able to tell them at some point in the foreseeable future, you’re going to be able to balance.  The previous administration completely gave up on that.  As I’ve said before, to the previous administration, if you borrow money — if I take money from you and I have no intention of ever giving it back, that is not debt.  That is theft.
And if we’re going to borrow money from people, we have to have a plan for how we are going to pay it back.  And that’s what this budget does, and that’s one of the things that is new about this budget.
The next word in the title is foundation.  What is the foundation that we’re trying to build here?  And I sum it up this way — again, I saw an article a couple weeks ago about “What is Trumponomics?” and that Trumponomics is part of the foundation here.  What is it?  It’s sustained, 3 percent economic growth.
Everything that we do in this administration, every single time I am called into the Oval Office — whether it’s on immigration policy, healthcare policy, tax reform policy, trade policy, budgets and spending — the focus is sustained, 3 percent economic growth.
We have been attacked, stunningly, by some folks on the left and even in the mainstream who say that that’s an unreasonable assumption.  We should stop and think how absurd that is to think that 3 percent growth in an American economy is to some people an absurd assumption.  It used to be normal.  Ten years ago it was normal.  In fact, it’s been normal for the history of the country.  I think the average over the 240-odd years that we’ve been a country has been over 3 percent.  It’s certainly been over 3 percent since World War II.
The 1.9 percent growth rates that the previous administration assumed towards the end of their administration, and the 1.9 percent growth rates for the entire 10-year window that the CBO growth rates assume — that the CBO assumes, the Congressional Budget Office assumes, are something we simply reject.  That is a pessimistic look at what the potential for this country and for what this country’s people is.  We reject that pessimism.
And so you know what?  We probably should have gone in and assumed 3.5 percent or 4 percent growth because that would be aggressive.  Three percent growth is just getting back to normal.
I’ve said it before, I say it again:  If you are 30 years old and you are watching this, or you’re sitting here, you have never had a job as an adult in a healthy American economy.  It’s either been a recession or a slow, sluggish economy stumbling along at less than 2 percent growth.
The differences between 2 percent growth and 3 percent growth doesn’t sound like much.  In fact, I cringe when I hear people say it’s only a 1 percent difference.  It’s not; it’s a 50 percent difference.  But that’s just math.  The difference in that is tangible.
At 3 percent economic growth in a healthy American economy, if you don’t like your job, you can quit because you know you can go get another job.  If you get laid off, you know you can go off and start your own business.  These are the opportunities that people have forgotten about.  And these are the things, the optimism in the country, the dynamism in the country that the President is so eager to push back and to bring back to the country.
It’s what drives every one of our policies, especially when it comes to anything dealing with jobs and the economy.  We will bring back 3 percent economic growth to this country, and those numbers are assumed in this budget.
By the way, if you don’t, the budget will never balance.  If you assume 1.9 percent growth, my guess is you’ll never see a balanced budget again.  So we refuse to accept that that’s the new normal in this country.  Three percent is the old normal.  Three percent will be the new normal again under the Trump administration.  And that is, part and parcel, one of the foundations of this budget.
Along those same lines, the budget also speaks to and funds a lot of the President’s priorities.  We’ve talked about this since March when we unveiled the budget blueprint.  National security, obviously a priority for this President.  Border security another priority for him.  We can talk at length, if you want today, about the details of the additional money that we spend in those areas.
The total plus-up, again, for the 2018 budget is $54 billion over the Congressional Budget Office baseline.  The law enforcement gets a significant increase here, and that’s both at the federal and the state and local level as we follow through on our efforts to enforce the law.
Veterans see more money here.  That’s a classic example of looking at the budget through the eyes of the taxpayer.  I put myself in the role of the person who is actually taking the money from you as taxpayer and giving the money to someone else in terms of a benefit.  And if I can look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you so that I can help this injured vet, I can do that in good conscience — I can look you in the eye, and my guess is you’re okay with that — I am a lot less comfortable to the point of not wanting to look you in the eye and say, look, I need to take this money from you to give to this person over here who really isn’t disabled but is getting a disabled benefit, or this person over here who is supposed to use the money to go to school, but isn’t actually going, or a program that is supposed to encourage you to graduate from high school — or from college, but is only 6 percent effective.
That’s the type of compassion we talk about, and that’s the type of different perspective that we bring to the budget.  And it’s one of the things that I like to talk about when we talk about the veterans.  People don’t mind paying their taxes as long as they know that that money is not being wasted and frittered away.
We also increase spending for school choice and paid parental leave, making this President the first President of either party to propose a nationwide paid parental leave program for parents and adopted parents.  There’s $20 billion in that over the course of the 10-year window.  I think I gave an incorrect number yesterday of $25 billion.
What are those, by the way?  National security, border security, law enforcement, veterans, school choice, paid parental leave.  They are all — all — campaign promises that the President made while he was running for office.
And that’s why I say these numbers are simply the President’s policies put onto paper.  We took the President’s speeches, we took his priorities.  We turned them into numbers, and that’s what it’s in the document.
It does not — along the same lines, not a single thing in here touches Social Security retirement or Medicare.  Why?  Because that’s what the President said when he was campaigning, that he would not change those things.
In fact, I’ve told the story several times of sitting in the President’s office with a list of possible reforms to mandatory — what some people call entitlement spending — and have the President at the end of the list go:  Yes, yes, no, no, no, no.  And the “no, no, no’s” were always Social Security retirement and Medicare.  Didn’t change those at all because he promised people that he wouldn’t.
We can do all that and balance at the same time because we look at spending differently.  We’re no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those programs.  We’re not going to measure compassion by the amount of money that we spend, but by the number of people that we help.
And that is how you can get 3 percent economic growth.  That is how you can balance the budget in 10 years.  That is how you can borrow money from people while still promising and intending to pay it back from them.  That is how you can help people take charge of their own lives again, and that is the part of the budget that deals with the American greatness.
So with that, I’ll take questions for a little bit.  I know there is a couple.  Yes, ma’am.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-fy2018-budget-052317/

MR. SPICER:  Wow, we got a full house today.  Good afternoon.  It’s good to be back with you.  Apparently I was a little missed.
We’re one week out from the President’s first foreign trip, so I wanted to make sure, as we prepare for that trip, that I bring out National Security Advisor, General McMaster, to give you a preview of what the team has been doing to prepare for the President’s trip.  Our goal is to kind of start that process now, and then next week bring the General back and give you a more detailed update as to what the President is going to be doing in each of the areas, and some of the highlights from the trip.  We’ll, obviously, additionally, have background briefings for you as well to give the team that’s going to be traveling, the press corps, some logistical updates.
So without further ado, General McMaster.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-051217/

1:45 P.M. EDT
MS. SANDERS:  Another light crowd today.  Good afternoon.  First off, before we get started, I’d like to bring up Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert to tell you about an executive order on cybersecurity that the President just signed.  He’ll take a few of your questions and, respectfully, I ask that you keep your questions for him on the topic of the executive order.  And don’t worry, I’ll come back and answer all of the rest of your pressing questions as soon as he wraps up.
So with that, I’ll turn it over to Tom.
MR. BOSSERT:  Thank you, Sarah.  Thank you very much for your time.  Couple of things positive to report today, and the first is that President Trump, about an hour ago, signed an executive order on cybersecurity.  And that executive order, among other things, is going to keep his promise that he has made to the American people to keep America safe, including in cyberspace.
I’d like to do a few things.  I’ll promise you that we will distribute the executive order, but if I could, I’ll preview the executive order for you, walk you through its three primary sections, some of its wave tops, and then take your questions.
Among other things, at least as an observation for me, I think the trend is going in the wrong direction in cyberspace, and it’s time to stop that trend and reverse it on behalf of the American people.  We’ve seen increasing attacks from allies, adversaries, primarily nation states but also non-nation state actors, and sitting by and doing nothing is no longer an option.  So President Trump’s action today is a very heartening one.
There are three sections.  They’re in priority order, in a sense.  The first priority for the President and for our federal government is protecting our federal networks.  I think it’s important to start by explaining that we operate those federal networks on behalf of the American people, and they often contain the American people’s information and data, so not defending them is no longer an option.  We’ve seen past hacks and past efforts that have succeeded, and we need to do everything we can to prevent that from happening in the future.
So a few things on federal networks.  We have practiced one thing and preached another.  It’s time for us now, and the President today has directed his departments and agencies, to implement the NIST framework.  It’s a risk-reduction framework.  It is something that we have asked the private sector to implement, and not forced upon ourselves.  From this point forward, departments and agencies shall practice what we preach and implement that same NIST framework for risk management and risk reduction.
The second, I think, of note — point in protecting our federal networks is that we spent a lot of time and inordinate money protecting antiquated and outdated systems.  We saw that with the OPM hack and other things.  From this point forward, the President has issued a preference from today forward in federal procurement of federal IT for shared services — got to move to the cloud and try to protect ourselves instead of fracturing our security posture.
Third point I would make is that the executive order directs all its department and agency heads to continue its key roles, but it also centralizes risk so that we view our federal IT as one enterprise network.  If we don’t do so, we will not be able to adequately understand what risk exists and how to mitigate it.
Number of thoughts on that.  Among other things, that is going to be a very difficult task.  So modernizing is imperative for our security, but modernizing is going to require a lot of hard, good governance.  And responsible for that today is the President’s American innovation — Technology Council, I’m sorry.  The President’s American Technology Council is going to run that effort on behalf of the President here out of the White House.  And we have great hope that there will be efficiencies there, but also security.
And I would probably note to you that other countries have taken two or three years to learn what we just came up with in two or three months, and that is that we can’t promote innovation without first thinking through risk reduction.  So doing that together is a message that we’ve learned, but doing it together is a message we’d like to encourage private sector folks to adopt.
So point two in the executive order is our critical infrastructure cybersecurity effort.  The President has directed the President’s Cabinet to begin the hard work of protecting our nation’s most critical infrastructures — utilities, financial and healthcare systems, telecommunications networks.  He’s directed them to identify additional measures to defend and secure our critical infrastructure.  And he’s continued to promote the message that doing nothing is no longer an option.
So the executive order not only requires his departments and agencies to help those critical infrastructure owners and operators and the most important ones, but to do it in a proactive sense.  The message is a tilt towards action.
We’ve seen bipartisan studies, as an observation from me, over the last eight years, both parties.  They’ve made powerful recommendations.  They have not been adopted for various reasons.  This executive order adopts the best and brightest of those recommendations, in my view.
I’m going to stop with those three and take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-homeland-security-advisor-tom-bossert-051117/

MR. SPICER:  Sorry I’m late, wrapping up some business.  Good afternoon.  The President this morning met with General McMaster.  As you know, General McMaster is helping lead the team that’s organizing the President’s upcoming foreign trip, and this week the President has been focused on meeting with the team, getting ready for the various stops that he’ll be making and meetings that he’s going to be having.
During his many conversations with world leaders, the President has seen a great desire for America to reengage and be a leader once again in helping solve the world’s complex problems.  And he’s already made moves, both behind the scenes with leaders and in his public statements, to show them that America is reasserting its leadership on the world stage.
These visits are another important part of this American resurgence.  While on the trip, the President will further our strategic objectives in the region, creating new opportunities that will strengthen the United States and our allies while weakening our enemies.  I know many of you are interested in the logistical aspects of this trip, and we’ll be trying to have further briefings throughout the week on those aspects of the trip as soon as we can, so stay tuned.
Also on the subject of foreign visits, I’d like to announce that the President has invited the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates to visit the White House on May 15th, and the Crown Prince has accepted.  We look forward to welcoming the Crown Prince and see the visit as an opportunity to deepen cooperation with a key partner in the Middle East.
Moving on to domestic matters, the Vice President spent his morning today on Capitol Hill.  He met privately with Majority Leader McConnell and also had individual meetings with other senators.  The discussions focused primarily on the path forward for the American Health Care Act in the Senate, and how the administration can work with Congress to craft a tax reform bill that follows the President’s priorities — simplification, providing tax relief to the American families and individuals, and stimulating the economy.
The Vice President also attended the weekly Senate Republican policy lunch.  Later this afternoon, the Vice President will be joined by Second Lady Karen Pence, General McMaster, and Ivanka Trump to welcome more than 150 military families of all branches of service for a reception at the White House.  The event recognizes National Military Appreciation Month and National Military Spouse Appreciation Day, which takes place this Friday.
The President’s Cabinet is busy inside and out of the beltway speaking on the administration’s agenda with local officials and key stakeholders.  Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price is in Michigan and West Virginia today, where he will hear from those on the front lines of the fight against the opioid epidemic.
Also today, the Justice Department announced that the Attorney General will be speaking on opioids on Thursday at a Drug Enforcement Administration 360 Heroin and Opioid Response Summit in Charleston, South Carolina.  The DEA’s 360 strategy is designed to help cities and surrounding regions deal with the heroin and prescription drug abuse epidemic and the violent crime associated with it.  This day-long event, sponsored by the DEA, Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and the University of Charleston School of Pharmacy, will bring together stakeholders and professionals working in law enforcement, prevention, education, treatment, recovery, healthcare, and emergency response.
In Washington, Secretary of Commerce Ross is speaking this afternoon at the 47th Conference of the Americas, which is taking place at the State Department.  The event brings together administration officials, distinguished leaders from across the region to focus on major policy issues affecting the hemisphere. Also at the State Department this morning, Secretary Tillerson participated in a signing ceremony for the United States-Georgia General Security of Information Agreement with the Prime Minister of Georgia, a major milestone in security cooperation between our two countries.
The President was also pleased to see several top administration officials recently move through the Senate.  Last night, Heather Wilson was confirmed to be Secretary of the Air Force, and Governor Branstad was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be ambassador to China and is moving on for a vote on the floor of the Senate.  The President also looks forward to seeing Dr. Scott Gottlieb serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration later today.
Finally, with regard to the Paris Climate Agreement, the President has been meeting with his team for quite a while on this matter, and he will not be making an announcement regarding that agreement until after he returns from the G7.
With that, I’d be glad to take your questions.

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  I want to thank Sarah for standing in for me on Friday.  She did a great job.  I missed you all tremendously.  (Laughter.)  Now that I realize that we can do that a little more I’ll spend a little more time at the Pentagon.
I moved this up a little bit — I appreciate your flexibility today so that the pool has enough time to cover the Vice President and Secretary Shulkin as they welcome Honor Flight our veterans to Washington on the anniversary of VA Day.  The Vice President is hosting more than 120 veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War as part of National Military Appreciation Month, and Public Service Recognition Week, highlighting the Trump administration’s commitment to our military and public service.
Also today, the Vice President, Secretary Price, Secretary Shulkin all attended an event on the scientific opportunities in biomedicine.  Key leaders from government, the private sector and academia discussed the United States’ comprehensive biomedical landscape and further educated White House staff, including assistants to the President, Ivanka Trump and Reed Cordish, on this important topic.
The meeting was organized by the National Institutes of Health and was led by its director, Dr. Francis Collins.  Leaders in the medical, education and research joined executives from companies who invest in biotech to provide analysis and real-life examples of how America’s sustained leadership in the biomedical industry has resulted in immeasurable benefits to both our country’s economic and physical well-being.
Among the participants were Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Dr. Craig Thompson, the president of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Dr. Cornelia Bargmann, the president of science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative;
Dr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, president of Stanford University; and Dr. Rick Lifton, the president of Rockefeller University.
The United States currently sits atop the list of global investors in innovation in the life sciences, responsible for 44 percent of global research and development.  This investment is dependent on the NIH and the important research it funds.  In order to maintain our international leadership in biomedicine, we must strengthen the partnerships between government agencies, investors, academics, the bio-pharma industry and research foundations.  This meeting was an important step in reinforcing that essential cooperation.
Moving on, I’m pleased to announce that today, shortly after this briefing, we will release a list of the President’s third wave of federal court nominees.  These 10 individuals that the President has chosen were chosen for their deep knowledge of the law and their commitment to upholding constitutional principles.
Two of the nominees today came from the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that the President released during the campaign.  If confirmed, Justice Joan Larsen will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.  Justice Larsen is currently serving on the Michigan Supreme Court.  And Justice David Stras will be a circuit court judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit.  He currently serves as a justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court.
The campaign list was put together from the Heritage Foundation, as well as the Federalist Society.  And as the President said last September when it was released, these “highly respected people are the kind of scholars that we need to preserve the very core of our country and make it greater than ever before.”  The President followed the principles that were used to guide that list to select the additional eight individuals.  And as I mentioned, the full list should be out very shortly.
In terms of the President’s schedule for today, this morning he met with his National Security Advisor, General McMaster.  He also spoke with the French President-elect to congratulate him on his victory.  A readout of that call should be out very shortly.  The Prime Minister of Georgia was also at the White House, meeting with the Vice President.  The Prime Minister then dropped by with the Vice President into the Oval Office to greet the President.  And earlier this afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President.
In about an hour, he’ll meet with Secretary of State Tillerson.  Secretary Tillerson has also been meeting with several foreign leaders today at the State Department, including the Prime Minister of Montenegro, the Foreign Minister of Slovakia, and the Foreign Minister of Qatar.
Secretary Mattis is also meeting with many foreign leaders during his European trip this week to reaffirm key United States military alliances.  The Secretary is in Denmark to co-host a meeting with the Danish Minister of Defense, with senior leaders from 15 countries that are key contributors to the ISIS military campaign.
While in Copenhagen, Secretary Mattis will also meet separately with the Minister of Defense to discuss European security and the importance of the NATO Alliance, and with the Danish Prime Minister to reaffirm the close ties between Denmark and the United States.
In other Cabinet news, Secretary Zinke is in Utah today, continuing his four-day listening tour on the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, putting into action President Trump’s April 27th executive order to review these monuments.  Secretary Zinke will be accompanied by the governor and a number of Utah’s congressional delegation and local stakeholders for a morning aerial tour of the million-plus-acre monument and an afternoon hiking tour and a roundtable meeting this evening with Friends of Cedar Mesa Museum.
While in Utah, the Secretary and other officials are holding daily press briefings on the ground.  You can reach out to the Interior Department for more details.
And with that, I’d be glad to take a few questions.

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Another busy day here at the White House.  As you know, the President has been talking to members of Congress the last few days about the American Health Care Act, up through this morning.  The Vice President just left a bit ago to meet with some of the lawmakers on Capitol Hill about healthcare and the rest of the President’s legislative agenda.  The President was glad to meet this morning with Representatives Long and Upton who voiced their support for the AHCA earlier this morning.
It’s especially important that we continue to make progress on repealing and replacing Obamacare, as rates skyrocket and insurers keep fleeing the market around the country in anticipation of this impending implosion.
Earlier this week, Aetna announced that it will scale back its presence on Obamacare exchanges even further in 2018, withdrawing from the Iowa exchange.  Aetna had already cut its participation in the exchanges from fifteen states to four in 2017.  Iowa is going to be hit particularly hard by these recent developments as Medica, the last insurance for most of the state, also announced this week that it will likely stop selling individual healthcare policies in the state, which will affect tens of thousands of Americans.
With reports like these seemingly coming every day, it couldn’t be clearer that it’s time for action on healthcare.  We’re glad that so many members are with us, and look forward to welcoming even more on board.
Also, earlier today, the President dropped by an event focusing on school choice that was hosted by the Vice President and Secretary DeVos with students ranging from kindergarten to high school.  Most of the students who visited the White House today are some of the thousands of local children who will benefit from the three-year extension of the D.C. School Choice scholarship secured by the President and congressional allies in the budget deal.
The District of Columbia’s Opportunity Scholarship program, which was launched in 2004, provides vouchers to D.C. students whose family either received benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or earned less than 185 percent of the federal poverty level.
And this program gets results.  Last year, 69 percent of D.C. public school students graduated from high school.  That’s compared to an incredible 98 percent of the D.C. scholarship students who received their high school diplomas last year.  Funding for the Opportunity Scholarship was one of our priorities during these budget negotiations, and the Trump administration is glad to have ensured that the program’s extension was taken care of through this appropriations bill, on top of the increases in military spending and funding for border security.
Today, the President welcomed the President of the Palestinian Authority to the White House for an official visit.  The visit stemmed from a phone call the two leaders had on March 10th, when President Trump invited President Abbas to Washington so they could discuss, in person, ways to move forward on a comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The two leaders made their own statements just a little bit ago.  But to give you a few additional details, some of the topics that were discussed during their meeting and the lunch were: advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace; preventing incitements to violence, particularly media outlets directly associated with the Palestinian Authority; strengthening efforts to combat terrorism, including defeating ISIS; measures to empower the Palestinian economy and provide economic opportunity for the Palestinian people.  And, additionally, the President raised concerns about the payments to Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails who have committed acts of terror, and to their families, and emphasized the need to resolve this issue.
Later this evening, the President, along with the Vice President and Mrs. Pence, will host members of the White House Evangelical Advisory Board in the residence for a discussion, prayer, and dinner.  The President is proud to welcome these faith leaders to the White House for the first time and thank them for their steadfast support ahead of the National Day of Prayer, which is tomorrow.
Later tonight, the Vice President will also deliver a keynote address at the Susan B. Anthony List 2017 Campaign for Life Gala.  The Vice President’s office has more details on that.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  Ken.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-050317/

MR. SPICER:  I hope you guys had a good weekend.  It was definitely a busy one for the Trump administration.  On Friday, the President signed several proclamations ahead of the start of the new month.  Those are all available at whitehouse.gov.
On Saturday, you may have not noticed, but it was the President’s 100th day in office, for those of you not keeping count.  The President took several significant steps towards leveling the playing field for American workers and businesses while visiting an Ames factory in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Ames has been making tools in America since before our country’s founding.  It’s an example of the amazing persistence of the American spirit — the type of company that will be able to expand and create new jobs under the President’s pro-growth economic agenda.
He signed two executive orders at Ames that will help keep jobs and wealth in our country.  The first fulfilled an executive order of a major campaign promise by directing the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation and abuse of our trade agreements and to use every measure available under the law the end those abuses.
And the second established the Office of Trade Manufacturing policy, which will be led by Dr. Peter Navarro.  This office replaces the National Trade Council and elevates it to a permanent office within the White House, sending an important signal to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate trade cheating while our manufacturing and defense-industrial base suffers.
He also signed a third executive order over the weekend establishing the American Technology Council, which will be led by Chris Liddell, which is dedicated to modernizing the federal government’s information technology so that it works more efficiently and effectively for everyone.  And he wrapped up the day speaking to thousands at a rally in Pennsylvania.
This weekend, the President also engaged with some of our longtime allies in Southeast Asia who are on the frontlines against the fight against ISIS and other forms of terror through calls with the President of the Philippines, the Prime Minister of Singapore, and the Prime Minister of Thailand.
Today is the start of another big week here.  After signing a proclamation on Law Day, he stopped by the Kennedy Garden, where around 100 members of the Independent Community Bankers of America kicked off their Capital Summit.  Smaller banks are one of the driving forces behind economic investment and development in our communities, but they have been disproportionately harmed by the dramatic increase in regulation since 2008, declining in number by 20 percent since 2008.
The President’s pro-growth agenda, including instituting what he has called a 21st century Glass-Steagall, will allow these banks to spend less time complying with unnecessary requirements, many of which were designed to police much larger entities, and more time, infusing their communities and local small businesses with capital.
It’s also the start of Small Business Week.  Today, Ivanka Trump will be participating in a conversation at the United States Institute of Peace with SBA Administrator Linda McMahon, and the Vice President will deliver remarks at the National Small Business Week awards program later this afternoon.
Back to the President’s schedule.  After speaking with the Community Bankers members, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, as well as National Security Advisor McMaster before meeting separately with Secretary Tillerson.
I also want to mention this morning that FEMA held a severe weather coordination call to discuss impacts on the remaining threat for continued severe weather across portions of the Southwest to the Mississippi Valley, which has already killed five people in Texas.  Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly participated on the call, and the White House is in contact with local residents in these affected areas.  We’ll have those communities in our thoughts and prayers, and encourage everyone to follow the directions of their state, tribal, and local officials to stay safe.
Finally let me run down what we’re expecting for the President’s schedule this week.  Tomorrow, he’ll present the Commander-in-Chief Trophy to the United States Air Force Academy.  Wednesday, the President will host the President of the Palestinian Authority for an official visit.  And on Thursday, he’ll host a National Day of Prayer event.  And as I mentioned last week, he will then attend an event commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea aboard the United States Senate Intrepid, and meet with the Prime Minister of Australia.
I’ll continue to update you on the schedule throughout the week.  And with that, your questions.

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  It’s a little bit of different room than this morning.  I’m sure you all know that I was up here earlier this morning, off camera, with some of your kids.  It was a pleasure to be able to share a little bit of the White House experience with them, and I hope they enjoyed it.  I think some of you have trained them very well.  I hope they enjoyed their visit, and I’m glad they got an opportunity to visit with the President and the Vice President today.
We have a bunch to talk about today about what the President has been doing, and he’s got an executive order coming up, so I’m going to try to get through it all.
This morning, the President welcomed the President and Mrs. Macri of Argentina for an official visit.  As you know, the President and First Lady of Argentina just left, so we will have a readout for you very shortly on that.  At 2:00 p.m., the President will be signing a memorandum on aluminum imports and threats to national security, so we’ll try to keep this briefing on time.
I know Secretary Ross spoke about the memo that the President signed yesterday, but I want to reiterate that the American aluminum industry is in trouble, having declined down to the lowest levels of aluminum that we’ve produced since 1952.  It is critical for our national defenses — the Army ground vehicles and the Air Force jets, the Navy warships.  But American companies are producing less aluminum than before, especially in the high-purity aluminum that’s used to build things like the F-35, the F-18, and the C-17s.
The Secretary of Commerce has initiated an investigation to determine what effect our reliance on imported aluminum has on both national and economic security.  The memo the President will sign today, similar to the memo he signed on steel, elevates this investigation and directs the Secretary to prioritize its completion.  This memo, combined with similar action on steel, is an important step towards fulfilling the President’s promise to “put American steel and aluminum back into the backbone of our country.”
The President has been speaking about revitalizing the American manufacturing industry for quite a long time.  Another one of the President’s most significant pledges has been to ensure that the men and women who have served this nation in our military have the care, treatment, and support they so greatly deserve.  So, later this afternoon, the President will go to the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he will sign an executive order that will take serious action to fix the broken VA system through the establishment of the new VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, which will remove and discipline federal employees and managers who have violated the public’s trust, while protecting employees that speak out about wrongdoing.
The President will be joined at the VA by several veterans and their spouses who have experienced or witnessed firsthand the poor quality of treatment that, unfortunately, too many of these heroes have received at VA facilities — including Sergeant Michael Verardo, who lost his leg and arm when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan in 2010, and his devoted wife and caregiver, Sarah.  The President is making it clear that the delays and improper care experienced by these veterans is unacceptable.
The President’s action today comes on top of the signing of the Veterans Choice Improvement Act last week, which gives more veterans the option of seeing the doctor of their choice without traveling long distance or waiting for VA care.  These actions, which are only the beginning of his plans to modernize the VA, the President is making it clear that the Trump administration will not accept anything but the best for those who have served our nation.
Today, as with every day this week, as we approach the 100th day in office for this President, he is continuing to follow through on some of the biggest promises that he made to the American people.  On Monday, he hosted a working lunch with members of the United Nations Security Council, reiterating his dedication to making America a leader in the world.  On Tuesday, he prioritized the protection of the farmers and ranchers of America’s heartland by establishing the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity.  Today, he took several important steps to review massive federal land grab by the previous administration under the Antiquities Act, an egregious federal overreach.  That was yesterday, actually.  And today, as I mentioned, he’s taking action on trade and veterans.
As we speak of trade, I know last night you saw a readout of the President’s call with President Peña Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau.  As the President just said, the President and the Prime Minister called him and asked him to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate it.  The President has a great deal of respect for these two countries and their leaders, and he said that he would hold on the termination while we negotiate a better and fairer deal for America and its workers.  But the President also made it clear that if the parties are unable to agree on a deal that is fair for American workers and companies, after renegotiation — giving renegotiation a good shot, he will move forward with termination.
And with that, I’ll take some questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-42-042717/

6:18 P.M. EDT
SECRETARY SHULKIN:  Hi, everybody.  this is my first briefing, so I’m glad to see you all.  Tomorrow, the President is going to be coming over to VA in the afternoon and is going to be signing an executive order that is entitled “Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection.”
As you know, accountability is an important issue to us at VA and something that we’re focusing on to make sure that we have employees who work and are committed to the mission of serving our veterans.  And when we find employees that have deviated from those values, we want to make sure that we can move them outside the VA and not have them working at VA.
The House has passed a bill already on accountability.  The Senate is working hard to do the same.  The President is committed to this issue and so, therefore, will sign an executive order.
What this Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Office does is it establishes a specific office with an executive in charge that will report directly to me as Secretary so that we can identify barriers that are preventing us from moving employees and people that we have identified that should no longer be working as VA, and make sure that we can do that expeditiously.  And that’s an important part of one of our priorities in accomplishing the mission that we have to take care of our countries veterans.
Be glad to take any questions on that issue.  Donovan Slack, from USA Today.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-veterans-affairs-david-shulkin-executive-order-improving-accountability-whistleblower-protections-042617/

2:07 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  I’d like to start off today by having the Secretary of Commerce discuss an action that the Commerce Department took last night with respect to Canadian softwood lumber.  It’s an action that talks about what we’re doing to make sure that we’re fighting for our industries here at home.
So without further ado, I want to bring up Secretary Wilbur Ross.
SECRETARY ROSS:  Thank you, Sean.
The action we took last night is actually the culmination of a couple of decades of disputes between the United States and Canada.  What’s provoked the disputes is the following.  In Canada, the forests are owned by the individual provinces, and each of the provinces sets a charge for the loggers to use when they’re taking trees down.  In the U.S., it’s all open market, it’s all market-based prices.
So the provinces subsidize the cutting down of lumber — the technical term being stumpage — and then that lets them charge a subsidized low price when the product hits the U.S. border.  We have determined preliminarily that those problems, while they vary from one province to another, in some cases are as high as roughly 25 percent, and on average are around 20 percent.  So they’re quite material items.
So the preliminary decision that was put out yesterday imposes those countervailing duties on softwood lumber from Canada.  Those duties will be collected starting today and they will be collected on a retroactive basis, going back 90 days, because it is 90 days ago that the Canadians were put on notice about this being an inappropriate process.  What it amounts to is the following.
There is roughly $15 billion worth of softwood lumber used in houses in this country, and about 31.5 percent of that comes from the Canadians.  So that’s roughly $5 billion a year.  A 20 percent tariff on that is essentially a billion dollars a year.  And the retrospective 90-day feature adds another $250 million to that on a one-time basis.
Softwood lumber, as I say, is fundamentally used in single-family houses.  We do not think that the price of lumber will go up by anything like the 20 percent, but there may be some small increase in the price of lumber for the house.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-042517/

6253,Trump,2017-04-25 12:11:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke on the Executive Order to Review the Designations Under the Antiquities Act,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
5:11 P.M. EDT
MS. WALTERS:  Hello, everyone.  As you guys knows, we’re going to go through an EO for tomorrow.  The speaker this evening is Secretary Zinke.  This is embargoed until 9:00 p.m.  It is on the record, so everything discussed here will be on the record.  The embargo is until 9:00 p.m. tonight.
Again, this falls underneath Kelly’s issue area, so if you have any additional follow-up questions, please reach out to Kelly Love.  For those of you on the phone, there will be a handout during this session, so if you would like the handout please email Kelly as well, and we will get it to you.
With that, I’ll turn it over.
SECRETARY ZINKE:  So I’ll read this and then I’ll answer some questions.  Tomorrow, the President will come to the Department of Interior, to my office, and sign the executive order to review the Antiquities Act.  The executive order will direct me, as the Secretary, to review prior monument designations and to suggest legislative changes or modifications to the monuments.  The monument designation period stretches from 1 January 1996 under which the act — and it has to include acts and monuments that are 100,000 acres or more — so the beginning date is January 1st, 1996, and the other condition is they have to be a total of 100,000 acres or more.  That should include about 24 to 40 monuments.  That gives you kind of a thumbnail.
The executive order directs the Interior to provide an interim report to the President within 45 days of the day of the order and a final report to the President within 120 days of that order.
For the record, in the last 20 years, in particular, that would cover about, oh, tens of millions of acres to include marine area sanctuaries.  Some of these areas were put off limits for traditional uses, like farming, ranching, timber harvest, mining, oil and gas exploration, fishing, and motorized recreation.
The designations on kind of the bookends are the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument of 1996.  And that was the first BLM land designation, all the way to really the Bears Ears National Monument in 2016, which has been in the news a lot.  So those are the kind of two bookends.  Again, it’s monuments that are 100,000 acres or larger, so it hits the big ones.
The President’s — the authority on such matters is singular, so you know.  There’s no requirement for public input before the designation of a monument and there’s no NEPA requirement.  Normally, when you do a land use project, we normally NEPA.  The Antiquities Act is the exception.  Again, we don’t have to go through legislative process; the President determines it, and it does not have to go through NEPA.
In this case, the administration, as you all know, has heard from members of Congress and states and, in some cases, the designation of the monuments may have resulted in loss of jobs, reduced wages and reduced public access.  And in the case of sign public land use, we feel that the public, the people that the monuments affect, should be considered.  And that’s why the President is asking for a review of the monuments designated in the last 20 years to see what changes, if any, improvements can be made, and give states and local communities a meaningful voice in the process.
And I can tell you, from a kid who grew up in Montana, or grew up in the West, where much-needed monuments have taken place, I think today’s executive order and review of the Antiquities Act over the past two decades is long overdue.
And the policy is consistent with the President’s promise to give Americans a voice and make sure their voices are heard.  Like many of the actions he’s taken since assuming the role of the President, the office, this is yet another example the President is doing exactly what he was saying in his campaign promises, and he’s delivering.
The President believes, like I do, that many of the neighbors in the Western states of the federal government can be a good neighbor.  We can protect areas of cultural and economic importance, and they can use the federal lands for economic development when appropriate, just as Teddy Roosevelt envisioned it.  I am a lifetime supporter and admirer of Teddy Roosevelt’s policies, and the President is the same.
The Antiquities Act of 1906 — and that was under President Roosevelt — it did give the President the authority to declare historic monuments, landmarks, prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic and scientific interest on federal lands.  Also in the Antiquities Act, authors specified the scope of the authority to “designate the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”  That’s verbiage from the act itself.
So with the average size of the monument’s designations over the past years has increased.  I think that should be worthy of notice.  Since the 1990s, when the act was first used, the average size of the national monuments came from 422 acres to, today, in the millions of acres.
So here’s what the executive order does in summary.  It restores the trust between local communities in Washington that the local communities and states will have a voice — those states that are affected, and local communities.  The executive order puts America and the Department of Interior back on track to manage our federal lands in accordance with traditional multiple use, as laid out by Pinchot and the President, and directs the Department of Interior to make recommendations to the President on whether a monument should be rescinded, resized, modified in order to better manage our federal lands.  And this executive order gives rural communities across America, again, a voice, as his campaign promised and is delivering that.
Here’s what the executive order does not do.  The executive order does not strip any monument of a designation.  The executive order does not loosen any environmental or conservation regulation on any land or marine areas.  It is a review of the last 20 years, and the review has timelines in which I am obligated to uphold.
So I have with me my advisor, Downey Magallanes, with me.  Downey is there, and she’ll help me answer questions if I cannot field them.  So, questions?  Sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-interior-ryan-zinke-executive-order-review-designations-antiquities-act-042517/

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL PROSPERITY
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
5:05 P.M. EDT
MS. WALTERS:  Ray Starling, who is at the National Economic Council, he’s going to be briefing you.  This is embargoed until this evening at 9:00 p.m.  It is on the record, and Ray can spell out his name for those of you who need it.  Again, embargoed until 9 o’clock tonight.  You have a factsheet, and Ray will take questions at the end after he runs you through anything.  And any additional follow-ups, direct them to Kelly.  She will be here after.
MR. STARLING:  Thank you.  Good evening and — or afternoon, rather, and thank you for not leaving and for being interested in the event that we’re doing tomorrow.  My name is Ray Starling.  I am the Special assistant to the President for Agriculture, Trade and Food Assistance.  And as you can guess, I was not raised north of Washington, D.C., so if we have any translation issues, we’ll let Kelly step in for those.  (Laughter.)
You have a briefing sheet in front of you.  I want to provide a little more commentary about the folks that will be joining us tomorrow afternoon.  We have assembled quite the group, and I want you to have a little background on each of them.  So I will move through that list much like a fat man moves through a barbed wire fence — hitting on the main points but getting through as quickly as possible.  (Laughter.)
Of course, you know Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.  We are very much looking forward to him being confirmed tonight.  He will have a busy day tomorrow beginning with his swearing-in first thing tomorrow morning, then going to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a speech to the employees there in the patio — that inner sanctum, if you will, of the USDA property over there.  I believe at the end of that event they will have Georgia peach pies for folks who partake in that, so that’s a nice touch.
Secretary Perdue — or, by tomorrow, Secretary Perdue we will call him — he is a farmer and has been engaged in agriculture and agribusiness for a number of years, so we’re certainly proud to have him at the table.
I would also point out Zippy Duvall.  Mr. Duvall is the president of American Farm Bureau.  He is a broiler, cattle, and hay farmer in Greensboro, Georgia.  A broiler is a meat chicken, as opposed to an egg chicken.  I’m sure you knew all that, but, in case you didn’t, I’m just showing off.
Ms. Valerie Early will be at the table tomorrow.  Valerie is a national FFA officer.  She is also a former 4-H member.  So Valerie will bring a younger perspective to the table.  She is an agricultural education major.  She is currently taking a year off from her studies to serve the FFA as an officer.  So we look forward to having Valerie in town tomorrow afternoon as well.
A.G. Kawamura.  Mr. Kawamura is from California; he has an interesting background.  His family has been involved in agriculture for a number of years.  They farm both conventionally and organic in Orange County, California.  So he has had to deal with some of the urban sprawl and rural interfacing issues that are really hitting a number of farmers around the country.  He’s also served as the Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and has been active in the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.  A ton of stuff on the web about A.G. if you want to read more about his background.
Luke Brubaker.  Luke comes to us from Mount Joy, Pennsylvania.  He is a dairy farmer in Lancaster County.  Started the farm in 1970 with only 18 cows, and now has over 800, and farms over 1,000 acres of land.  Has a number of different production techniques that he engages there in Pennsylvania.
Iowa’s Secretary of Agriculture, Bill Northey.  Mr. Northey is also still farming, in addition to serving his state as Secretary of Agriculture.  He is a fourth-generation Iowa farmer, and still grows corn and soybeans on his farm near Spirit Lake.  He has been the Secretary of Ag since 2006, and so he certainly understands this sector and will bring an important perspective to the table tomorrow.
Tom Demaline from Avon, Ohio.  Tom is — we certainly consider him, in the agricultural space, as a farmer, but he does nursery and landscape projects — or nursery and landscape production, I should say.  His entity, Willoway Nurseries, supplies nursery products to, I believe, 26 states throughout the Midwest and out on the East Coast.  So he’s certainly been active in the Ohio Nursery and Landscape Association and in other industry associations.  So Tom will be with us tomorrow afternoon.
Ms. Lynetta Usher Griner.  Ms. Griner farms two different main crops in Florida.  One is — she’s actually a timber producer.  She’s a forester.  She was the first female president of the Florida Forestry Association.  She also farms cattle.  Some of that production occurs in Florida, and some of that production occurs out in Kansas.  She piqued our interest because there happens to be someone in the Senate from Kansas who is very interested in agriculture.  And so she can represent both Florida and Kansas during the conversation tomorrow.  She was Florida’s 2013 Woman of the Year in agriculture.
Terry Swanson is from Walsh, Colorado.  He has lived in Colorado all of his life and raises a number of cattle on 10,000 acres of ranch land, and then he also farms 7,500 acres of land.  He’s been very active in the National Sorghum Producers Association and also on some research panels with the Colorado State University Extension Service there in Colorado.
Commissioner Steve Troxler is the North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture.  Commissioner Troxler no longer farms tobacco, but at one time did — that, wheat, vegetables, and soybeans.  At one time Commissioner Troxler — if you were eating a tomato in the Piedmont of North Carolina at a restaurant, you, more than likely, were eating his tomato.  He’s a past president of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, and he has been very active with the FDA as they are implementing their Food Safety Modernization Act regulations.
An eleventh person on our panel tomorrow is James Lamb.  Just as an aside, Mr. Lamb told me a fun story.  I asked him, I said, what is the name of your farm, and do you call it Lamb Farms or Lamb Family Farms?  And he said he had to change his name and put his entire name on the sign by the road because when people drove by and saw “Lamb Farms,” they kept stopping and wanting to buy a lamb.  So he does not raise lambs.  He is, however, a pig farmer for Prestage Farms, down in North Carolina, and he also does environment quality for Prestage Farms.  So he has his own farm, and in addition he works for the company, leading part of their environmental protection efforts.
He has been named an “outstanding pork producer” by the North Carolina Pork Council.  He also grows corn, soybeans, millet, Bermuda grass, and cattle.  That is not unusual for that part of the country — pig farmers who spray their effluent out on Bermuda grass, wait for the appropriate period of time to pass, grow out the grass, and then harvest the grass and feed it to cattle.  So if we were looking at a production map of that part of the country, we would see both hay, cattle, and pork all be sort of synonymous in that area.  So Mr. Lamb will be with us tomorrow.
Hank Choate.  And I need to apologize — completely my mistake — on your briefing document he is referred to as “Hang Choate.”  He is not “Hang,” he is “Hank.”  So my apologies for that.  Please help us correct that.  Hank runs Choate’s Belly Acres, in Cement City, Michigan.  A very interesting story:  A seventh-generation farmer, and they take very seriously continuing to involve the different generations in the farm.  He has been very active in a number of associations and organizations in the ag world there.  He’s also a dairy farmer.  He has Holstein cows, and also grows corn, alfalfa, soybeans, and wheat.  So a great story with Mr. Choate coming in tomorrow.
Ms. Maureen Torrey.  She is from Mr. Trump’s home state of New York.  She’s an eleventh-generation farmer near Rochester, New York.  She raises fresh market vegetables and runs a dairy farm with about 2,000 cows.  Also operates a grain farm and a trucking company.  So Ms. Torrey, we’re pleased to have her at the table, and we look forward to seeing how she and the President interact over their rural New York roots.
Mr. Jose Rojas is the vice president of farm operations at Hormel in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  He is the only person in our group who can honestly make a claim to the fact that he raises over 450,000 pigs a year.  He oversees the production operations for Hormel, and as I understand it, later this summer will be transferring over, where he will be helping to raise turkeys.  So he checked both of those boxes.  An interesting gentleman because he was born in Mexico, came to Iowa State to receive part of his education — a master’s degree in animal husbandry — and then started working in the vertically integrated pork sector.
And the last person on our list, Ms. Lisa Johnson-Billy.  And I also apologize, I might have mis-alphabetized her name.  I probably put it with the J as opposed to the B.  But Ms. Johnson-Billy is a former member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.  She was termed out there.  She started the first Native American caucus that the legislature in Oklahoma had.  She is still a farmer, and her family lives on about a 200-acre farm.  She has three sons, all of whom were involved in FFA, and one of whom, when he went off to Oklahoma State University, he got active or became active in ROTC and is currently in training to be an active-duty helicopter pilot with the United States Army.
Our intention tomorrow is for the President to meet each of these folks to hear a little bit about their operation and to hear what’s on their minds.  As we point out, in terms of pure numbers, the ag sector does not make up a large part of the population, but certainly those engaged in the allied industry sector do and their economic impact in rural communities across America certainly allows them to punch above their weight, if you will.  We also brag on them.  Certainly we have the most efficient farmers in the world, the most effective at producing our food, and that’s why we pay a lower percentage of our income on food than any country in the world.
I would add one other thing, and I would just say, to my knowledge — we have asked the librarian to help us double-check this, actually raised this point this morning with the North American ag journalists and I got checked a little bit, but not entirely wrong — we cannot find any reference to a presidential meeting with a group this size this early in a President’s administration, back to Reagan’s time, when in either January or February of 1981, when the Russian wheat embargo was going forward, something that Reagan had agreed to end were he to become President and something that Carter had implemented.  Our understanding is that there were a group of farmers that came to the White House very early in Reagan’s administration to have a conversation about that.  That’s the only other record we can find at the moment.  But I’m sure if I’m wrong about that you will let me know.  But to say that it’s been a while would be an understatement.
The last thing I would cover on the roundtable is that we certainly expect a wide range of topics to come up, as is evidenced by the wide range of folks who will be attending the meeting.  They are listed there for you.  I will not insult you by reading them, but certainly the list could grow longer.  All of these things are issues that those of us in agriculture see as potential limiting factors economically and things that we need to address.
I think that then sets up exactly — that need is what sets up the task force that the President will establish tomorrow.  He will be asking Governor Perdue — hopefully by tomorrow Secretary Perdue — to establish a task force that does a 180-day review of regulations, policies, legislation that unnecessarily hinders economic growth in the agricultural sector.
We also, in the course of that executive order, sunset the current makeup of the Rural Council.  We certainly think they did some important work and we’re glad that they focused on rural America and brought some of the members of the last administration together.  However, there are very few records formally of their meetings.  I think a blog was maintained, but very little in the way of their accomplishments.  And so one of the things that we will ask the task force to do is to take a look at, were we to create another body along those lines, what would that need to look like and how could it be most effective at establishing cross-agency communication and cross-agency collaboration that’s good for agriculture.
With that, I think I’m happy to take questions.  Are we good?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/record-press-briefing-presidents-executive-order-promoting-agriculture-rural-prosperity/

MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. I hope those who celebrated had a great Easter holiday and have had a chance to go out and check out the activity on the South Lawn. We’ve got a few waves still to go.
The President and the First Lady welcomed thousands of families here to the White House this morning for the 139th Annual Easter Egg Roll. When it’s all said and done, we will have had thousands of guests, including many active-duty military, veterans, families, children from local schools, patients from local children’s hospitals, all here to share in this historic event.
Right about now, the President is finishing up his regular meeting with the Secretary of State. The Vice President, of course, is currently on a 10-day trip visiting South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia. While in South Korea, the Vice President participated in an Easter church service with both American and South Korean servicemembers and their families, and has been holding bilateral meetings with representatives of the South Korean government.
The Vice President is delivering a message to the people of the Republic of Korea on behalf of the President that even in these troubled times, the United States stands with them for a free and secure future. Under President Trump, our ironclad alliance will be even stronger, our nations will be safer, and the Asia Pacific region will be more secure.
From South Korea, the Vice President will head to Japan. I’ll continue to provide updates as they warrant during the Vice President’s trip throughout the rest of the week.
Looking ahead, tomorrow the President heads to Wisconsin, where he’ll talk about his “Buy America, Hire America” agenda at Snap-on Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin. For those of you who aren’t aware, Snap-on is a prime example of a company that builds American-made tools with American workers for U.S. taxpayers. We’ll be having a background briefing here in this room, later this afternoon, with senior administration officials regarding the details of the trip. Further guidance should be coming out in your inboxes momentarily.
On Wednesday, the President will sign the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act. The President is proud to sign this legislation, which passed unanimously by the Senate earlier this month. The bill ensures that veterans have certainty and continuity of care while this administration works with Congress to develop a plan that reforms the VA system and gives our nation’s heroes the care that they deserve.
He’ll also host the New England Patriots this Wednesday to congratulate them on their fifth Super Bowl win.
And, on Thursday, the Prime Minister of Italy will be here for an official visit.
And with that, I’ll kick it off to the birthday boy, Mr. Jim Acosta.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-041717/

1:24 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. As many of you are aware, there’s currently some news breaking out of Afghanistan, so I just want to give you a quick update.
At around 7:00 p.m. local time in Afghanistan last night, the United States military used a GBU-43 weapon in Afghanistan. The GBU-43 is a large, powerful and accurately delivered weapon. We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters used to move around freely, making it easier for them to target U.S. military advisors and Afghan forces in the area.
The United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously. And in order to defeat the group, we must deny them operational space, which we did. The United States took all precautions necessary to prevent civilian casualties and collateral damage as a result of the operation. Any further details, I would refer you to the Department of Defense on that.
Moving on, as you may know from the schedule, the President has a 2:00 p.m. event, so I’m going to try to keep this rather tight so the pool has an opportunity to get in and set up appropriately.
Earlier today, the President signed H.J. Res. 43, bringing the total number of Congressional Review Act legislation pieces that he has signed now to 13. This resolution that he signed today overturns a regulation that was put in place by the previous administration on their way out the door that would have taken away the right of states to set their own policies and priorities for Title 10 family-planning programs.
Our federal system was set up to allow states to address the unique needs of their own populations when possible, especially
— comes to programs as important and sensitive as family planning. With the bill signing, the President has restored respect to states’ rights on this particular issue.
As I mentioned at the top, there’s an event at 2:00 p.m. where the President will be meeting with the brave first responders who were involved in the I-85 Bridge collapse and thank them — that occurred in Atlanta to thank them for their work and dedication in addressing this horrible situation. The bridge collapse during rush hour on March 30th — but due to the heroic efforts of Atlanta’s first responders, some of whom will be here today, no lives were lost. The President is proud to hose these brave individuals and honor their commitment to protecting their community.
Later this afternoon, the President will head to Florida for the Easter holiday. He will be departing Joint Base Andrews via motorcade, as the preparations for the Easter Egg Roll are well underway on the South Lawn, preventing a Marine One departure.
And while we’re on the topic — I know it was brought up the other day, so just to give you quick notes on what to expect this coming Monday. We expect more than 21,000 people to attend the Easter Egg Roll. The allocations of tickets have been given to schools, children’s hospitals, and military and law enforcement families. Commemorative eggs will be handed out to the children who attend. Nearly 18,000 eggs were ordered, which is in line with past years. The event will start at 7:30 a.m., with different groups of guests arriving every two hours to ensure that all the children have an opportunity to participate in more than a dozen activities that will be available. Further logistics and guidance will be provided over the weekend.
Also today, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC, designed — designated one entity and one individual connected to human rights abuses against Iranian political prisoners in Iran’s prisons. The individual who was designated for his role in abuses in Iran’s prison is the brother of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s IRGC Quds Force, who was himself previously designated under terrorism, counter-proliferation, and human rights authorities.
The sanctions against human rights abusers in Iran’s prisons come at a time when Iran continues to unjustly detain in its prison various foreigners, including U.S. citizens Siamuk Namazi and Baquer Namazi. We join recent calls by international organizations and U.N. human rights experts for the immediate release of all U.S. citizens unjustly detained or missing in Iran so that they can return to their families.
OFAC also designated two ISIS financial facilitators and ISIS supporter in North Africa, continuing our ongoing effort to disrupt key leadership nodes for the group.
Moving on, over the past few days, the President and members of the Cabinet have held many meetings and discussions with their international counterparts about the significant foreign policy challenges facing our world. Yesterday you heard from the President himself, alongside NATO Secretary General, about the need for a strong-funded Alliance to combat terrorism, the humanitarian crisis ongoing in Syria, and many other serious threats to our collective safety and security.
Also yesterday, Ambassador Nikki Haley, along with her counterparts from nine other nations, voted in favor of a draft resolution to denounce the heinous chemical attack carried out by the Assad regime last week. Unfortunately, but not surprising, Russia stood in the way of this resolution. However, I’d like to point out the abstention of China, on the heels of President Xi’s recent successful visit, and Kazakhstan, a longtime Russian ally and former member of the Soviet Union. Both of these abstentions are notable and signify that the United States is persuading the world that the use of weapons of mass destruction cannot go unanswered.
Secretary Tillerson, as you know, was in Russia yesterday to meet with his counterpart and ensure that they are made fully aware of the United States’ position in both areas of practical cooperation, such as defeating ISIS, and areas where Russia does not share our interest and values.
As you know, the Vice President will be departing for his 10-day trip to South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Australia on Saturday morning. His office will be providing more information later today.
Finally, I’m glad to announce the President will host the Prime Minister of Italy for an official working visit to the White House next Thursday, April 20th. The leaders will discuss the upcoming G7, which will be hosted in Italy and Sicily, and a range of issues of mutual concern.
With that, I’d be glad to take some of your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-spicer-041317/

BY OMB DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY
ON A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR REFORMING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND
REDUCING THE FEDERAL CIVILIAN WORKFORCE
James Brady S. Briefing Room
4:04 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: As I mentioned earlier today, we’re going to do a briefing on the record, off camera. OMB Director Mulvaney is going to walk you through the guidance that has been issued to departments and agencies throughout the government following up on the President’s executive order with respect to reorganizing government.
He will walk through that, take your questions at the end. There’s sort of a memo that he has provided to the different departments and agencies that we’ll give you guys a copy of at the end. And then let us know if you have any further questions.
So without further ado, Director Mulvaney.
DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks, Sean. Thank you all for coming out. Here’s what’s getting ready to happen. Tomorrow, in the morning, we will be releasing our guidance related to the executive order on the government restructuring. Why should anybody care about that? This marks a couple of different things.
First of all, it’s a major accomplishment for the administration in the first 100 days. It’s something we said we were going to do on day one, and we’re following through well within the end of the 100-day period. More immediately, perhaps, the government hiring freeze will end with the release of this guidance. That does not mean — and I’ve made this very clear to all of the agency heads, the deputy chiefs, et cetera, for the last couple of days — that does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly.
What we’re doing tomorrow is replacing the across-the-board hiring freeze that we put into place on day one in office, and replacing it with a smarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan. And what that means specifically is that, consistent with the President’s priorities in the budget, certain agencies will end up hiring more people. Other agencies will end up paring their FTEs even greater than they would have had during the hiring freeze.
So we’re going from this sort of across-the-board hiring freeze. That’s not unusual for any new management team to come in — to put into place when they come into an organization, whether it’s the private sector or a government. Not unusual for a new management team to come in and say, look, stop hiring, let us figure out what’s going on, we’ll get acclimated and then we’ll put into place something that’s more practicable and smarter. And that’s what this is. So you’ll see this across-the-board ban tomorrow, and replaced with a smarter approach.
To the larger issue, the government reorg is probably the biggest story that nobody is talking about. Yes, we talk about healthcare; yes, we talk about taxes; yes, we talk about infrastructure — and all of those are extraordinarily critical to rebuilding the country, making America great again, as the President has said. This is something that goes much deeper and to the very structure of government.
This is trying to do something that has never been done before. The executive branch of government has never been rebuilt. It has grown organically over the course of the last 240 years, and the President of the United States has asked all of us in the executive branch to start from scratch, a literal blank piece of paper and say, if you’re going to rebuild the executive branch, what would it look like.
One of the things we’re doing for the first time ever, we think, is soliciting a lot of input from outside. You go to the website, the WhiteHouse.gov website and see a — what I’m told is not a completely terrible — I thought it was awful — video that I made on there, soliciting input from individuals — like to say, look, if you’ve had a contact with a federal government that you think could go better, tell us about it. If you’re an academic and you’ve got an idea on how to fix the government, tell us how to do it, give us the ideas. So we’ve got a website set up for that.
We met this morning with CEOs from all across the nation and said, look, we’re trying to do something that’s never been done, we’re trying to rebuild the executive branch of government, give us some ideas. By the way, they did. And one of the ideas I took away from that meeting this morning was a suggestion from the group of business leaders that says, look, why don’t you restructure the government in terms of the functions that it performs. Instead of following some organically created guidelines over the course of the last two centuries or instead of following the 12 appropriations committees on the Hill, go and look at the functions.
Does the government want to be in the business of trade? Okay, then let’s go find all of the functions of government that deal with trade and put it in one place. The best example I can think of is workforce training, and the number I have — always stuck in my head — is we have 43 different workforce training programs spread across at least 13 different agencies.
Now, there’s a rule in the private sector which is that if everybody is responsible, nobody is responsible. And that’s what we face right now all too often in the executive branch. If the President, for example, wants to know why the federal government workforce training programs aren’t functioning as best as they possibly can, there’s no one person he can turn to and say, why is that, and shouldn’t we be able to fix that. And that’s one of the things that we’ll be looking for.
We think at the end of the day this leads to a government that is dramatically more accountable, dramatically more efficient, and dramatically more effective, following through on the very promises the President made during the campaign and that he put into place on day one.
The schedule, by the way, is that the agencies now have I think until — is it September? June?
AIDE: June preliminary, September final.
DIRECTOR MULVANEY: So June they’ll come back with — we’ve gone out to the agencies with this and say, why don’t you, by the way, you give you your ideas on how you can improve your agency. If you’ve always had an idea why NASA should be in the Department of Agriculture, now is your time to speak up. Okay, this is a blank piece of paper, and we ask all the agencies to come back to us. So between June and September, we’ll be collecting that data from the agencies. And then, in September, we’ll be starting to go back to the President and say, look, here are some of the ideas with a goal towards putting these things into place roughly 11 months from today.
And with that, I’d be happy to take any questions. Yes.
AIDE: I just want to remind everyone that this is embargoed until 11 p.m. Folks that are on the phone and in the other room, this is on the record, of course, but —

1:42 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: I want to start off this afternoon by a quick comment on the tragic and heartbreaking events that unfolded at a San Bernardino school yesterday. The events occurred after the briefing, so I just want to make sure I acknowledge that our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families of the three victims. We hope for a speedy and full recovery of those who were wounded in the events that occurred.
Moving on to today, the President this morning led a discussion with some of the world’s top job creators on how private sector thinking could help the government modernize and provide a better, more efficient services to the American people.
Together, the companies that were represented in the room this morning employ nearly 4 million people worldwide and at least 1.78 million Americans here in our nation.
Starting in small, interactive groups, the Cabinet members shared their strategic visions for their departments and listened as business leaders offered their unique perspectives on how they might achieve those goals. The groups then came together and shared their discussions and outcomes with the President.
The meeting was hosted by the American office — the Office of American Innovation and was another opportunity for the administration to engage with the private sector and harness its knowledge to develop innovative solutions to some of our country’s biggest problems, like the crumbling infrastructure and broken system at the Veterans Administration.
Also this morning, the President completed several procedural steps to ratify the protocol for Montenegro’s accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization following the Senate’s overwhelming and bipartisan vote of advice and consent in support of this ratification. The United States looks forward to formally welcoming Montenegro as the 29th member of the NATO Alliance.
And later today, the President will have a series of meetings with his national and economic security team. Later, the Attorney General is also at the southwest border to announce specific new actions the Trump administration is taking to secure our borders and keep the country safe.
The administration is committed to ending the practice of smuggling gangs and cartels across the border that flood our country with drugs and violence. These actions, which include a strengthening of the laws applying to those who are caught attempting to illegally return to the United States after prior removal and those who profit off smuggling people across the border will once again make it clear to the brave men and women of law enforcement that the Trump administration has their back.
And Secretary Tillerson finished the G7 foreign ministers meeting today and is now in Moscow for meetings with his Russian counterpart. The visit is part of our effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure that the United States’ views on the situation in Syria, counterterrorism efforts, North Korea, and other matters are clearly conveyed. We’re open to strategic cooperation with Russia when we can achieve a shared goal such as defeating ISIS. But we’ll stand up for interests and values when we do not see eye to eye.
Russia must fully honor the commitments it made on Syria, Ukraine, and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and other topics of international concern. And Secretary Tillerson is going to make that clear during his visit.
I also want to make it known that Secretary Mattis and General Votel, who is the COCOM* [SOCOM] commander of Central Command, will be giving a full briefing on the strike in Syria that occurred today, at the Department of Defense at 3:30 p.m. Then at 4 o’clock, I’ll be back up here for an off-camera briefing with Director Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget and OMB Senior Advisor Linda Springer regarding the President’s executive order on reorganizing the executive branch.
So that gives us three briefings, plus this today. Not to get you real excited, but we’ll have another one tomorrow morning in advance of the NATO meeting with the Secretary General. This afternoon’s briefing will be discussing the plan on reforming the federal government and reducing the size of the federal civilian workforce that OMB was directed to produce by executive order. So we’ll be spending a lot of quality time together over the next 48, 24 hours.
And with that, I’d be glad to take a few questions.
Ken.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-041117/

1:45 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Welcome back, everyone. Good to see you all after a few days — for those of you who didn’t get a chance to go down to Florida.
This morning, in the Rose Garden, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. His confirmation was the culmination of a thoughtful and deliberative process that the President started almost a year ago when he released his initial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court.
In September, he released a final, definitive list, promising to select only from those individuals who would continue the legacy of the great Justice Scalia on the bench. And today, the President celebrated our new associate justice who will protect our Constitution for generations. It was definitely a great day to kick off the week, and another productive week that we will see here at the White House.
Before I get into the upcoming week, just a couple updates from over the weekend. First, the President spoke with Prime Minister Lofven of Sweden to express our condolences for the loved ones who were killed in Friday’s terrorist attack in central Stockholm, Sweden, and to wish a speedy recovery for those who were wounded.
The President also called President Sisi yesterday to convey his deepest condolences to Egypt and the families who lost loved ones in the heinous attack that occurred there. Dozens of innocent people were killed and many more were injured on holy Palm Sunday. The United States condemns in the strongest terms these barbaric attacks on Christian places of worship in Tanta and in Alexandria.
The President also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister of Japan, the Acting President of South Korea, all about the United States’ military strike on the airfield in Syria. All of the leaders expressed support for the United States’ necessary action in response to the horrible chemical and bomb attack on innocent civilians.
And yesterday, he spoke with Commander Andria Slough, the commanding officer of the USS Porter, and Commander Russell Caldwell, the commanding officer of the USS Ross, to thank them and their teams for successfully carrying out that strike. During these calls, the President communicated that he could not be more proud of the crews of these two ships and their flawless execution of these operations.
As you know, these ships, between the two of them, sent 59 Tomahawk missiles and each of them hit all of their targets, showing America’s power and the military’s accuracy, which is just a small representation of our military’s overall capability and a fraction of what this President will continue to build up the military to be throughout his administration. The sight of people being gassed and blown away by barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of action again, we hold open the possibility of future action.
The resulting action of what happened ensured that their fueling operation is gone from this air facility, 20 percent of their fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed and knocked out, and I think by all measures, the world and domestic reaction was highly laudable for the President’s action.
Additionally, obviously, we’re all aware that the President had a very successful visit with the Chinese President, and it concluded on Friday. As you’ve read, one of the most significant developments from these discussions was the agreement to create a 100-day initial plan — hopefully with some tangible near-term deliverables — to lead to a more balanced economic relationship between our two countries. As that develops, we’ll make sure that we provide you with additional details.
And this morning, the President was glad to see Toyota announce that it will be spending $1.33 billion in its Kentucky plant as part of its plan to invest $10 billion in America over the next five years, a continued signal of the confidence that businesses have in the American economy under President Trump.
Now, in terms of the week ahead. Tomorrow, the President will have a discussion on strategy and policy with several members of his Cabinet and a group of CEOs. This is a follow-up from his meeting with 20 CEOs from the Strategic and Policy Forum just this past February, with some of the same business leaders and some new ones.
First, they’ll meet in small interactive groups, each led by a Cabinet member, to discuss the priorities for those Cabinet Secretaries and their agencies. The President will then oversee a report that will be presented to the group — by the group, rather. The Cabinet-level participants will be Secretary of Commerce Ross, Secretary of Education DeVos, EPA Administrator Pruitt, OMB Director Mulvaney, and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. We’ll have the full list of additional participants for you later.
As part of the effort to deescalate the conflict in Syria and press for a political process that can resolve the conflict and eventually result in a transition of a new, legitimate Syrian leadership, U.S.* [U.N.] Special Envoy for Syria will be coming to Washington tomorrow for consultations with the State Department and with National Security Advisor McMaster here at the White House, among others. He has been overseeing the political talks among Syrian parties in Geneva.
On Wednesday, we will welcome the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, to the White House. The President and Secretary General will have a joint press conference later in the afternoon.
And then the President plans to spend the Easter holiday in Florida, and he’ll return to the White House on Sunday.
As the President noted today, as we hit day 81 in the President’s administration, we have done so many great things, including nominate and confirm a Supreme Court justice; roll back more regulations than any President in modern times; roll back the Obama-era war on coal, oil and natural gas; restore confidence in the economy. We’re now seeing historic levels of consumer, CEO, homebuilder, manufacture confidence. There’s been a 12 percent gain in the stock market. We’ve even seen a real resurgence in the mining industry. We’ve reduced illegal boarding* [border] crossings by over 60 percent to the lowest level in nearly two decades, and implemented historic ethics reforms, including a five-year lobbying ban and a lifetime foreign ban.
So with that, I’d be glad to take your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-041017/

Palm Beach, Florida
10:18 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Tonight, Secretary Tillerson and NSA Director, Lieutenant General McMaster, will both give comments regarding the President’s order tonight, and then afterwards we’ll take a few questions and then let you get to some sleep.
With that, Secretary Tillerson.
SECRETARY TILLERSON: Good evening, all. I think what we want to try to do is give you a little bit of background on how we got to the statements by the President and the actions that were taken tonight.
As you’re well aware, Bashar al-Assad has carried out chemical attacks this past week on civilians, including women and children, and carried out attacks earlier — last month, March 25th and 30th in Homs Province, as well. We have a very high level of confidence that the attacks were carried out by aircraft under the direction of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. And we also have very high confidence that the attacks involved the use of sarin nerve gas. At least the past three attacks were fairly high — we have high confidence on that.
I think it’s also clear that previous agreements that had been entered into pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118, as well as Annex A agreements that the Syrian government themselves accepted back in 2013, whereby they would surrender their chemical weapons under the supervision of the Russian government. Now, the U.S. and the Russian government entered into agreements whereby Russia would locate these weapons, they would secure the weapons, they would destroy the weapons, and that they would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria.
Clearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. So either Russia has been complicit, or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement.
I think the other thing that’s important to recognize — that as Assad has continued to use chemical weapons in these attacks with no response — no response from the international community — that he, in effect, is normalizing the use of chemical weapons, which then may be adopted by others. So it’s important that some action be taken on behalf of the international community to make clear that these chemical weapons continue to be a violation of international norms.
I think it’s also important to recognize, as I think everyone does, the chaotic circumstances that exist on the ground in Syria, with the presence of a battle underway to defeat ISIS, the presence of al Qaeda elements inside of Syria, and a civil war that is underway. So, clearly, one of the existential threats we see on the ground in Syria is if there are weapons of this nature available in Syria, the ability to secure those weapons and not have them fall into the hands of those who would bring those weapons to our shores to harm American citizens.
So there are a number of elements that, in our view, called for this action and which we feel was appropriate. We feel the strike itself was proportional because it was targeted at the facility that delivered this most recent chemical weapons attack. And in carrying this out, we coordinated very carefully with our international partners in terms of communicating with them around the world. And I will tell you that the response from our allies in Europe, as well as the region in the Middle East, has been overwhelmingly supportive of the action we’ve taken.
So I’ll leave it there. And let me turn it to NSA Director McMaster.
GENERAL McMASTER: I really have very little to add except to say that it was important during the President’s deliberations and its deliberations with his leadership that we weighed, of course, the risk associated with any military action, and we weighed that against the risk of inaction, which Secretary Tillerson has already really summarized, which is the risk of this continued egregious, inhumane attacks on innocent civilians with chemical weapons.
And so, really, nothing else to add to the Secretary’s summary. And we’re happy to take any questions that you have.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-state-rex-tillerson-national-security-advisor-general-h-r-mcmaster-4-6-2017/

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome back.  Got a busy week ahead of us.  Before I get started, I want to just give you a quick update on something I know in the past there’s been several questions about the President donating his salary to charity.  I got an update for you on that.
To that end, the President has spoken with Counsel and made the decision to donate his first-quarter salary, in total, to a government entity, and he has chosen this quarter to donate it to the National Park Service.  The Park Service has cared for our parks since 1916, and the President is personally proud to contribute the first quarter of his salary to the important mission of the Park Service, which is preserving our country’s national security.
So it is my pleasure, on behalf of the President of the United States, to present a check for $78,333 to the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, and Superintendent of the Harper’s Ferry Park site, Superintendent Brandyburg.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-040317/

6369,Trump,2017-03-31 08:40:00+00:00,Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:40 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First off, I want to catch everyone up who wasn’t able to make the briefing last night on the executive orders on the trade — executive orders that the President is going to be signing this afternoon.
The first order directs the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to examine every form of trade abuse and non-reciprocal practice that are currently contributing to the United States’ large and persistent trade deficit, which was the largest of any major nation in 2016 at $500 billion.
Within 90 days, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative will submit a comprehensive report to the President on the causes of our unduly large deficit. It’s the first time in modern history that an American President has called for such an investigation, and its — our findings will allow us to make smarter decisions on behalf of the American people about our trade policy of our country going forward.
That’s why the AFL-CIO, United Steelworkers International, the International Association of Machinists and the Aerospace Workers International all came out today to applaud the order.
The second order addresses the current lack of enforcement of one of our strongest tools in fighting unfair trade practices — countervailing duties. Countervailing duties were put in place to address the problem of other countries dumping undervalued goods into American markets, making it impossible for American businesses to compete with artificially low prices.
This is especially a problem in countries whose governments subsidize exports into our country. So to discourage this practice, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency has a mechanism for assessing these type of transactions and imposing financial penalties, known as countervailing duties, when it’s determined that this kind of malicious dumping has occurred.
Since 2001, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency has not collected over $2.8 billion in these duties. If you think about it, we could do a lot by maximizing this enforcement power for our country. So we need to do a better job on behalf of the American worker. If a foreign company, often due to its being partly or entirely government-run or subsidized, is able to flood American markets with an artificially cheap steel, for example, they price American companies out of the system.
Say you’re the owner of a steel company in Ohio. You can’t compete with some of these below-market prices. So you have to find other ways to meet your bottom line, like closing a factory and laying off workers, or might entirely having to close down entirely.
By not properly using this enforcement mechanism we’re costing Americans who work in so many industries — not just steel, but in agriculture, chemicals, machinery, and other manufactured good in particular
President Trump was elected to do everything he can to support American workers and American manufacturers. Together, these two executive orders are a significant step in accomplishing the President’s promise to end unfair trade practices once and for all.
Also, yesterday, we were pleased to see that Senators Manchin of West Virginia and Heitkamp announce their support for Judge Neil Gorsuch. And Senator Claire McCaskill conceded at a private event that among the list of potential nominees that the President released during a campaign, Judge Gorsuch was — according to her, quote — “one of the better ones.” We hope that her praise leads to additional support — and her support.
It’s hard to find any reason except for obstructionism to see why fellow Democrats in her caucus have not been able to join them.
As I said yesterday, Judge Gorsuch is highly regarded, having received a rating of “well qualified” from the American Bar Association, and has demonstrated an unparalleled and unprecedented level of transparency, including the release of over 75,000 pages of documents, fielding nearly 300 questions from Senate Democrats on the committee, and 70 pages of written answers about his personal records, and has demonstrated a mainstream judicial record — with nearly all of the decisions being joined by Democrat-appointed judges.
Without a clear justification, Senate Democrats have fudged the facts on recent history, to try to mislead the American people about their unprecedented obstructionism, essentially claiming a non-existent 60-vote standard. As I’ve said before, should Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer get his way, this would be the first successful filibuster of a nominee to join the Supreme Court. This would make history in a very bad way.
They’ve also forgotten their own words. I’ve cited previously this week the rhetoric of Senator Schumer, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the regrets of invoking the filibuster by Senator — President Obama, then Senator Obama, and the words of many other Senate Democrats, like Senator McCaskill, on why blocking a vote for a judge having gone through the process has no precedent and is irresponsible. Let me cite one more argument that many Senate Democrats have recently made.
Current members of the Senate seem to also reject the notion of a Supreme Court operating with eight, not nine, justices. These include Senators Schumer, Dick Durbin, Bernie Sanders, Dianne Feinstein, Jeanne Shaheen, Richard Blumenthal, Amy Klobuchar, Ben Cardin and Martin Heinrich. Each of these Senate Democrats and the rest of their fellow caucus members need not listen to me or the President, but their own words as recently as last year.
The President told the American people in his Weekly Address that was launched earlier today why it is. And again, we call on Senate Democrats to end this unnecessary obstruction and confirm an imminently qualified jurist to the bench.
Also last night, the Department of Justice filed an appeal in the 9th Circuit to Hawaii’s federal judge’s preliminary injunction against the President’s lawful and necessary executive order dealing with protecting this country.
Moving on to some of the events of today. This morning, the President met with former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice. They had an opportunity to talk about regional threats, current affairs hotspots, our attempt to defeat ISIS, and many more areas. It was a great meeting where they discussed many of the challenges facing our country. And the President sought the former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor’s advice and opinions on a variety of subjects.
He also signed House Joint Resolution 42, allowing states to drug test unemployment insurance claims, and H.R. 1362, naming a VA outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa.
Also this morning, the President joined Jay Timmons, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, and some of its member CEOs to unveil the Association’s annual Manufacturers’ Outlook Survey. An incredible 93 percent of manufacturers surveyed by the National Association of Manufacturers now have a positive outlook for the future. That’s a 20-year record high that’s more than 35 points higher than that same rating was last year.
To quote from the survey itself, “The rising confidence stems from the belief that the new administration in Washington, D.C. will bring much needed regulatory relief, as well as reforms to the tax code and a significant infrastructure package.”
The optimism is evident across the spectrum of indicators. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up over 12 percent since Election Day. The National Association of Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. The Gallup Small Business Index shows that small business owners are the most optimistic they’ve been since 2007.
It’s not surprising that American industry is reacting in this way. The President has taken immediate steps to make it easier to do business in this country. And we are just at the beginning of this process. On top of the significant steps taken in the executive orders this morning, he’s also withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, cleared the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, began a much needed government-wide reform of our regulatory and permitting processes, and signed legislation preventing the burdensome streamline — “Stream Protection Rule” from causing further harm to America’s coal industry.
The President was glad to see this report add to the list of measurements reflecting the incredible optimism and positivity that his pro-growth policies have created.
Back to this afternoon. The President will meet with the Director of the National Institutes of Health before signing the aforementioned executive orders on trade at 3:30 p.m. And he will meet with Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.
In Cabinet news today, the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is in Brussels, attending the NATO Foreign Ministers Meeting. There, he reaffirmed the Trump administration’s steadfast commitment to NATO. Secretary Tillerson also stressed the need for all member countries to meet their defense spending commitments, as well as the need for NATO to take a larger role in the fight against terrorism and ISIS.
The President looks forward to meeting with his NATO counterparts in Brussels this May to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO and to discuss ways to strengthen the alliance in order to cope with challenges in national and international security.
This morning, the Office of the United States Trade Representative released the 2017 National Trade Estimate. The annual report, which is required by law, surveys the significant barriers faced by American exporters. Its findings reinforce the need for the President’s “America First” trade agenda, which prioritizes the enforcement of the trade laws to protect American workers and job creators. The President looks forward to having Ambassador Lighthizer in place as the USTR so that he can begin his important work in earnest and fulfill the mission of this report.
And Transportation Secretary Chao — who, yesterday, celebrated the 50th birthday of the Department of Transportation — today directed the Federal Highway Administration officials to award $10 million in Emergency Relief funds to help begin repairs on Atlanta’s collapsed I-85 Overpass. Releasing these funds will quickly help to ensure that the bridge is repaired safely and in a timely manner.
The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has already talked with the Georgia Governor’s team and Secretary Chao has spoken with the Governor.
Looking forward — as promised, today we will be releasing the U.S. OGE Form 378 financial reports as filed by commissioned officers here in the White House. Right after I’m done here we’ll have a background briefing with Senior White House compliance and ethics officers to walk you through how that process is going to go and the public release of that information, which will occur later this evening. We’ll be sure to update you if there’s anything further to add.
This weekend, the President will be here in the White House holding meetings. We’ll be sure to update you if there’s anything further to add.
And on Sunday, the White House will honor World Autism Awareness Day by lighting the White House in blue to join with the autism awareness community. Further research into the causes and treatments for autism spectrum disorders is one of the President’s priorities. As we light it blue on Sunday, the White House will be celebrating all of the individuals and families whose lives are impacted by autism.
I would note that it’s a really interesting story how this came to be. The head of Autism Speaks, an organization that has done tremendous work with this, Bob Wright is one of the cofounders — is a longtime friend of the President. His wife, Suzanne, was struggling with pancreatic cancer last year. And the President made a pledge to her. He said, if I’m elected President, in supporting this cause that you care so deeply about, I will light the White House blue. So it is in Suzanne and Bob Wright’s honor that this will occur for this great cause. And I hope Bob knows that Suzanne is looking down proudly to see that that pledge has been fulfilled.
With that, I’ll be glad to take your questions.
John Roberts.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-033117/

6370,Trump,2017-03-31 05:29:00+00:00,Background Press Briefing on the Upcoming Visits of President al-Sisi of Egypt and His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan,Nan,"James S. Brady Briefing Room
10:29 A.M. EDT
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning. I’d like to welcome everybody who’s here and everybody who’s dialed into our morning NSC backgrounder on the upcoming Egypt and Jordan visits.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We’re going to address two topics that are coming up. One, next week, we’ve got President Sisi coming in on the third of April, and we’ve got King Abdullah coming in for a White House visit on 5 April.
To begin with, I will make a few comments about the President Sisi visit.
The President is excited to welcome Egyptian President al-Sisi to the White House on 3 April. And he wants to use President Sisi’s visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two Presidents established when they first met in New York last September.
Egypt is one of the traditional pillars of stability in the Middle East and has been a reliable U.S. partner for decades. President Trump’s initial interactions with President al-Sisi, including their phone call on January 23rd, have already improved the tone of the relationship, and we hope next week’s visit continues this positive momentum.
President Trump aims to reaffirm the deep and abiding U.S. commitment to Egypt’s security, stability and prosperity. President Sisi has taken a number of bold steps on very sensitive issues since becoming President in 2014. He’s called for reform and moderation of Islamic discourse, initiated courageous and historic economic reforms, and sought to reestablish Egypt’s regional leadership role.
He has also led Egypt’s campaign to defeat a long-running terrorist threat in the Sinai. The United States wants to support President al-Sisi’s efforts in all of these areas. Our relationship has historically been driven by security, and that will remain a key component of the engagement with Egypt. The U.S. and Egyptian militaries have built close relationships, and many military officers from Egypt have trained at U.S. military installations.
President Trump also supports al-Sisi’s ambition to develop a comprehensive counterterrorism approach that involves military, political, economic, as well as social efforts. But President Trump also wants to increase the focus on economic and commercial cooperation in our bilateral relationship. Building a more stable and productive economy is a critical step to ensuring long-term stability in Egypt. And President Sisi, we would like to note, has begun a necessary economic reform plan that will strengthen the Egyptian economy if it is fully executed.
There’s no question the transition in their economy will be difficult, but in the long run, Egypt will be stronger if it follows through on its homegrown reform plan. Our relationship with Egypt is complex and covers a number of very challenging issues, and we’re fully aware that next week’s meeting is only the start of a long process of improving this historical relationship.
We are optimistic that we are heading in the right direction, and President Trump is very much looking forward to the visit.
Now, just a few comments on the visit of King Abdullah. The President is pleased to welcome King Abdullah on April 5th. The two leaders will gather for a meeting in the Oval Office and then proceed to a working lunch. Jordan is a key partner for the United States in the region, and we anticipate the two leaders will discuss a range of shared priorities, including efforts to defeat ISIS, how to end the conflict in Syria, and advancing progress between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The President met with King Abdullah briefly on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast in February, and at that time the two agreed on this follow-on meeting. It was important to the President that he welcome King Abdullah to the White House early in his administration as a sign of the strong friendship and partnership. Of utmost importance, this is an opportunity for the President to convey his continued support for our steadfast partnership with Jordan on a range of key regional issues.
And as the President has said, we’ll work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish ISIS. Jordan is a critical partner in that effort and it plays an outsized role in this effort as well as in the region.
And with that, that concludes our opening comments.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: And again, I’d like to thank everyone for being here. And I’d just like to remind everyone that we have these two gentlemen who are national security policy experts. This backgrounder’s purpose is to provide answers to you on issues relating to these two topics — the upcoming visits and the relationships with these two countries.
So please, respectfully, pitch your questions that way. Also, at your request, you can expect that when we’re done here we have a one-page written backgrounder that will be submitted on both countries to you guys. So please stick around after this to receive that.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/background-press-briefing-upcoming-visits-president-al-sisi-egypt-majesty-king-abdullah-ii-jordan/

6371,Trump,2017-03-31 09:50:00+00:00,Background Press Briefing on Financial Disclosure Forms,Nan,"James S. Brady Briefing Room
2:50 P.M. EDT
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ladies and gentlemen, we’re just going to continue kind of moving on a quick pace, because we do have — we’ve got multiple events happening today, and we got a hard stop today at 3:15 for this. So I’m going to be very brief. Just a couple of ground rules for this. This is going to be a background briefing on the release of the financial disclosure forms. That will happen later today. The embargo for this briefing is 5:00 p.m.
I would like to introduce two individuals, and they can give you their full titles when they come up here. But [senior administration officials] are with the White House Counsel’s Office. What they’re going to do is walk you through the process, exactly what these individuals had to go through, and give you kind of a broad brush of what you will see once these records are released later on this evening. And, hopefully, if you can keep your questions to the process, I think we’ll be able to get through this more quickly and with more useful information.
But with that, let me introduce [senior administration officials]. If you’d like to take the podium.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks very much. We’ve both been working pretty hard for a while on putting together the financial disclosures that are going to be made available online this afternoon and this evening. And so we thought what we’d do now is take an opportunity to walk through both what it is that you’re going to be seeing, what it represents, and also how it fits into the process so that as you’re analyzing the financial disclosures, you have a sense of what it is that you’re looking at, where we have gone from the time when we’ve received the information that we’re releasing, how this process continues going forward and gives you the opportunity to ask the kind of questions, and doing it in a way that is based on the facts and what it is that we have.
So what I want to make sure that we’re talking about is that everyone understands how the information that you have, that we’re going to be releasing this afternoon is developed. And just a process point at the outset: We’re going to be putting live, later this afternoon, on our website the ability the enter a form — it’s called a 201 form, which is a legally required form that, if you’re requesting financial information, you say what your name is, you identify a little bit of information and your email address, who it is that you’re seeking financial information on, you enter that. And then later this afternoon or this evening, we’re going to be sending out to everybody who went online this afternoon and asked for a specific person, we’re going to actually send you the PDF of the full 278 form as we have it in the current form, which is going to then give you the opportunity to follow up with the press office as to any additional questions. But we want to make sure that you understand what it is that you’re seeing.
And the other piece that I want to make sure that we’re talking about is to understand that the documents that you’re going to be seeing, which are comprehensive financial disclosure documents that talk through salaries, assets, commonly held assets with spouses — it’s a very comprehensive set of documentation. Understand that the documents, though, that you’re going to be seeing, which are going to be listing lots of assets and lots of holdings, are going to be the starting point, the documents that we receive — as people come into government, they would fill out this form, and they would identify all of their assets and all of their information.
This is then the information that we — and my colleague is going to talk through it, because he’s really been taking the laboring more on meeting with every single one of our commissioned officers, talking through how we handle the issues, talking about what potential conflict of interest there might be, and then helping everyone work through what the ethics agreements are going to be as folks have been migrating through the process.
But understand that when you see lots of assets on these forms, these are not the current holdings that everyone has today. These are the holdings that everybody had at the time when they came into office. So you’re going to see a lot of people that are holding a lot of assets that one would say, well, gee, isn’t a conflict of interest if this person has this asset today, what are we supposed to make of that? And we want to make sure that everyone is cautioned here against simply writing a story that says, “This person holds this today, there must be a conflict of interest.”
This, as I said, the starting process is we looked at this information as it came into us. It’s the basis that we used, then, to have a sit-down meeting with every single one of the public filers. The public filers is every single commissioned officer and every single civilian White House employee who is making over $161,755. So every commissioned officer and everyone who is making above that is a public filing disclosure, and is going to be subject to your inquiry.
And so what we did is, once we identified this information, sat down with them, said, look, we have identified these assets, there’s a process now to how you’re going to be divesting yourself; you can’t hold this asset and do the job that you’re tasked with doing here, how are we going to go through the process of selling it? And there’s a very sort of complex process of getting what’s called a certificate of divestiture — and my colleague can talk through a little bit about that.
Also, there’s a lot of information that the Office of Government Ethics puts out. They actually put out a very hand document that we have some copies of, of what the certificate of divestiture process works with. We hand this out to our folks to say, before you can sell the asset that might be a conflict, you have to work with us and the Office of Government Ethics to make sure that we’ve gotten the proper certificates before you unwind the assets.
And so that entire process is what we’re going to turn over, and I’m going to let my colleague speak to. But there’s one or two other just points that I wanted to speak to, the first of which is I want to highlight the incredible complexity and the sophistication of the assets and the financial structures that this White House is going to present.
These are incredibly successful individuals, very high net worth, very sophisticated, complex asset structures, numerous sub-LLCs, trusts and other items, all of which have to be worked through. Very helpfully, the Office of Government Ethics prepared a report analyzing the sophistication of this incoming White House versus the preceding administration, and they created a fairly helpful document. We’ve got some copies of it for you that’s, again, created by the Office of Government Ethics that talks through — under the Obama administration these were simple ones, moderately difficult, complex. And for those who are fans of “Spinal Tap,” these were the “elevens” out of ten on the scale. And you can see how the complexity relates from the folks that were in the previous administration to the complexity that we’ve been dealing with here.
And I would invite anyone to go from this to make sure you’re also talking to the Office of Government Ethics if you want full sort of feedback on what the nature is of how this process works. They’re going to talk to the sophistication and the complexity of what we’re doing.
They’re also going to tell you that this is a process that it is very common, extraordinarily common, for there to be changes even from here going forward as we work through with people making sure we’re characterizing the documents properly, and that it’s not at all unusual if you see something that you download today, and that, 20 days from now, there might be a minor change to it — you’re going to get to see those things, but that that’s not going to be an indicator that maybe something was amiss or that someone was hiding something.
And I’d refer you to the Office of Government Ethics. I think they’re going to be pretty happy to share that with you.
Before I turn it over to my colleague, I wanted to do one other thing, just to talk about how the timeline here all works. As somebody comes into the administration, they have 30 days to fill out this form. So the documents that you’re going to be seeing are the documents that were filled out by people within 30 days. They’re entitled to two 45-day extensions. We had very few of those. Everybody who was there on the first day has the 278s originally filed and into us.
From the time that the person files, we in the Office of the White House Counsel have another 30 days to really look through and review all of these documents before the public has the opportunity to request these documents. That’s pretty much where we are now for folks who started at the beginning.
I did a little bit of research to see when the preceding administration did their sort of release of everyone. I think I found some Washington Post articles from April 3rd, 2009, saying last night on a Friday the White House released all this information. So we’d point out today is the 31st, a little earlier than the April the 3rd.
And what happens then with respect to our most senior filers — the assistants to the President, deputy assistants to the President — is there’s actually an additional review process that happens with the Office of Government Ethics. That is going to be an ongoing process. We are going to continue working with them as they will then review and then provide feedback to us, and they can talk about how that works.
So again, this is an ongoing process. The documents you’re going to be seeing are a snapshot in time — an entry snapshot in time. And we want to make sure that everyone understood what it is that you’re looking at.
And with that, I’m going to turn it over to my colleague, who can talk through sort of the process that he went through.
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. So this all started prior to day one for most folks in the administration that had been appointed to the White House, where, day one, they begin filling out these forms. And a lot of folks started working directly with OGE, the incoming White House Counsel staff. And then post-day one, we assisted all of the commissioned officers with preparing the reports. And that takes some time.
As the reports get complete, we have to make sure they’re accurate, they have to be submitted by each individual filer. They have to certify that they’re accurate to the best of their knowledge. We assist them through the process to make sure that it’s clearly — the assets are clearly delineated in the particular forms.
And at that time, we start counseling immediately, because the ethics laws apply day one. And we begin counseling immediately as to potential conflicts, what they should be recusing themselves from, what they should consider divesting from, and what they need to resign from. And those are kind of the three components. It’s resign, divest, and then recuse, in that order.
So folks who were in other jobs or other positions, so to speak — and it doesn’t even mean paid positions — have to resign from those positions prior to beginning government service, and everyone did. In the case of, I think, two very good examples that I’m going to use today — Gary Cohn and Jared Kushner — for instance, Jared Kushner had 266 positions that he had to resign from. He began early on in January, maybe even prior to January, in starting to prepare to get into this process. Gary Cohn did the same thing. He resigned from all his positions immediately and worked through it.
The divestiture part pertains to assets. So that relates to assets that they may be involved in. Obviously Kushner had a number of different assets with a number of different companies; he’s in the process or has divested and has divested from most of those that may have created a conflict of interest coming into this job.
Now, both of those individuals had very broad responsibilities, so it’s very important that we’re in tune to the fact that these broad responsibilities — and we are recusing from the issues that they need to recuse from — but divestiture is the most important thing. And Gary Cohn, within 90 days, for his liquidated stocks, interests, and within 120 days for his Goldman Sachs interest will be fully divested. And he’s far ahead of that process now.
As that process goes on, we move to the ethics agreement portion of it. Every single commissioned officer in this administration will have an ethics agreement. That means it’s an agreement that the White House Counsel’s Office and the individual has agreed upon what they’re going to divest, what they’re going to recuse from, and that will all be delineated in writing, so it’s very clear as to what they need to do going forward to be both in compliance with the ethics laws and the pledge — the ethics pledge.
So that’s kind of the process that we go through. At this stage, everyone has filed — that started day one, January 20th — everyone has filed. We are in the process — some have ethics agreements that’s are prepared, some don’t. We’ve counseled everyone. I’ve sat with every assistant to the President and given them personal counseling. I’ve been managing a team of lawyers — because I think it’s roughly 180 folks that have come through the process — a team of lawyers who have been meeting both on phone calls and in person with each one of the commissioned officers in this administration.
So that’s kind of a flavor for it. In terms of divestiture, I talked a little bit about Gary and Jared. And another person — another good example is Reince. He was a lawyer and worked at the RNC; he resigned from the RNC, resigned from his law firm. But not only that, he divested from his interest in his law firm. And that is a story that’s told all the way across the board with this administration, because it’s so important that we’re able to — that they’re able to do their jobs conflict-free.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/background-press-briefing-financial-disclosure-forms/

1:57 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Matt, you had a phenomenal story today. (Laughter.) Get that joke? If you didn’t, look it up. A little delayed reaction to that. (Laughter.)
Before I get into the events of today, there’s a few items I wanted to update you on, things that have happened since our last briefing yesterday.
The President spoke with Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq to thank him for his productive visit and meeting on March 20th.
A readout of that call should have been issued after the pool last night.
Yesterday, he also notified Congress that the national emergency declared Executive Order 13694 regarding malicious cyber-enabled attacks will continue beyond April 1st, 2017.
As you all know, this notification is required by statute in order to extend the national emergency that the past administration declared.
The President believes that the significant cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to our national security and economic prosperity, and therefore he has determined that it was necessary to continue this national emergency.
Last night, a federal judge in Hawaii put an indefinite hold on the President’s executive order that was issued on national security. The Department of Justice is reviewing the ruling and is considering the best way to defend the President’s lawful and necessary order.
This ruling is just the latest step that will allow the administration to appeal. Just a week ago, the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia upheld the President’s order on the merits. The White House firmly believes that this order is lawful and necessary, and will ultimately be allowed to move forward.
This morning, we announced that the President will host President Xi of China at Mar-a-Lago on April 6th and 7th. The President looks forward to meeting with President Xi and exchanging views on each other’s respective priorities and to chart a way forward on a bilateral relationship between our two nations. They will discuss the issues of mutual concern, including North Korea, trade, and regional security.
Now, on to some of the events of today. This morning, the President had a meeting with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. The Secretary, along with the National Economic Council and the rest of the President’s team of experts have been meeting with and hearing from stakeholders on all sides of the tax reform debate.
Tax reform has been a centerpiece of the President’s economic agenda from the beginning of his campaign. The team is weighing the best option to develop a plan that will provide significant middle-class tax relief and make American businesses more competitive.
Enacting the first significant tax reform since the 1980s is going to be a serious undertaking. And we are at the first stages of this process, beginning to engage with members of Congress, policy groups, business leaders, industry, constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders.
Tax reform has been a part of the political discussion for years, and, accordingly, lots of people have a lot of ideas about it. We intend to hear from them. He and his team will continue to meet with those who support and oppose the various policy options, as they all are still on the table, because the President is committed to delivering results that the American people and American businesses will be able to see and feel in their paychecks.
On the Hill this morning, the President was glad that the nominations of his Secretary of Agriculture-designate Governor Sonny Perdue and Secretary of Labor-designate advanced out of committee. Although he was disappointed to see that Democratic senators who had previously expressed their support for Alex Acosta, the Labor Secretary-designee, nonetheless, while they had previously supported him, seem to have stuck to a party-line vote. The President looks forward to having them officially on the team and in the Cabinet as soon as possible.
Also this morning, the Department of Commerce and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) announced that AT&T will build the first nationwide [wireless] broadband, a network dedicated to America’s first responders. This step was part of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations on improving the ability of our police, fire, and emergency medical personnel to communicate seamlessly across jurisdictions, which is critical to their missions. It’s also a sign of the incredible ability of public-private partnerships to drive innovation and solve some of our biggest problems while also creating jobs and growing the economy.
Back to the schedule, this afternoon the President hosted a legislative affairs lunch on opioid and drug abuse. The lunch was an opportunity to discuss the goals and agenda of the President’s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, which he established yesterday.
The commission, which is going to be chaired by new Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is the next step in the President’s promise to the American people that he would take real action to keep drugs from pouring into our country and corrupting our communities. Under Governor Christie’s leadership, and working closely with the White House Office of American Innovation, the commission will bring together leaders on both sides of the aisle to find the best ways to treat and protect the American people from this epidemic.
Many members in attendance at the lunch played a key part in passing the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, also known as CARA, the first major federal addiction legislation in 40 years, which authorized over $181 million to fight the opioid epidemic. Part of the mission of the President’s commission will be to ensure that those funds are spent efficiently and effectively. Too many lives are at stake to risk wasting any money on this effort.
Moving on, later this afternoon the President will welcome Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark for a working visit.
We’ll have a readout on their bilateral meeting for you at its conclusion.
A couple follow-ups from yesterday: I know Hunter asked about the House and the Senate passage disapproving of the Federal Communications [Commission’s] regulations on privacy rules from last year. So let me just expand on that a little and get to your question.
The White House supports Congress using its authority under the Congressional Review Act to roll back last year’s FCC rules on broadband regulation. The previous administration, in an attempt to treat Internet service providers differently than edge providers, such as Google and Facebook, reclassified them as common carriers — much like a hotel or another retail outlet — and opened the door to an unfair regulatory framework. This will allow all service providers to be treated fairly and consumer protection and privacy concerns to be reviewed on an equal playing field.
The President pledged to reverse this type of federal overreach in which bureaucrats in Washington take the interests of one group of companies over the interests of others, picking winners and losers.
The President has signed more legislation under the Congressional Review Act, ending job-killing rules and regulations than all previous Presidents combined already, and he will continue to fight Washington red tape that stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth.
Jeff was here yesterday, Roberta is here now — but following up on Jeff’s question, he asked about the administration’s position on the Paris climate treaty. We are currently reviewing issues related to the agreement, and expect to have a decision by the time of the G7 Summit, late May-ish, if not sooner.
Before I take your questions, I wanted to speak quickly about Judge Gorsuch again and the process behind his nomination and confirmation. From the beginning, I think the President has been clear and 100 percent transparent about his choices, if he had been elected, who he would choose from. As a matter of fact, I’d say that the level of transparency is probably unprecedented in modern times, at least.
During the campaign, he gave the American people a list of 21 judges which he would pick his choice for the Supreme Court from. The American people sent him to the White House to nominate one of those judges — and he did it. Prior to the President making his final decision, the White House spoke with 29 senators — more than half of whom were from the Democrat side of the aisle, including every Democrat member of the Senate Judiciary Committee — to seek their advice and consent on the nomination. The consensus was that the President’s pick should be a respected mainstream judge.
As I’ve laid out many times before, from unanimous consent of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to the extraordinarily low rate of majority opinions accompanied by dissent, Judge Gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream, respected judge. He has offered the Senate plenty of material to vouch for that. Since his nomination, Judge Gorsuch met with nearly 80 senators.
In response to requests from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch provided the following: over 70 pages of written answers about his personal records in response to 299 questions for the record by Democrats on the committee, the most in recent history, which he submitted within six days of receiving the questions; over 75,000 pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written work going back as far as college; and over 180,000 pages of email and paper records related to the judge’s time at the Department of Justice
In fact, the Department of Justice provided access to many documents that would normally be guarded by various privileges, in a historically unprecedented move in the spirit of cooperation with Senate Democrats. And the judge sat for three rounds and nearly 20 hours of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he was asked nearly 1,200 questions, almost twice as many as Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or Ginsburg.
The White House and the judge did all of this in the hopes that Senate Democrats, many of whom already had announced their intent to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, would look beyond their political game and see for themselves how eminently qualified he is to sit on the Supreme Court.
Unfortunately, it looks more and more like Senate Democrats would rather do all that they did in reading and questioning for nothing more than for political theater.
Finally, before I take your questions, a letter was transmitted just recently to the ranking member and chairman of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that said, “In the ordinary course of business, national security staff discovered documents that we believe are in response to your March 15, 2017 letter to the intelligence community seeking ‘documents necessary to determine whether information collected on U.S. persons was mishandled and leaked.'” We have and will invite the Senate and House ranking members and Chairman up to the White House to view that material in accordance with their schedule.
With that, I’d be glad to take a few of your questions.

12:08 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good morning, everyone — or it’s technically afternoon, I guess. Sorry to move it up and screw up the schedule a little, but we’ve got a couple of events this afternoon so I’ve got to get through this, get some questions and then got to move on. But we’ve got two more on-camera briefings the rest of the week.
This morning, the President just wrapped up — or is continuing to — I know some of the pool just left — but the President is currently hosting an opioid and drug-abuse listening session with senior administration officials, governors, experts in the psychology of drug addiction, recovery-awareness advocates, and others who have been affected by the opioid crisis.
Drug abuse has crippled communities across this nation. In 2015, more than 52,000 Americans — that’s 144 people a day — died from a drug overdose, with 63 percent involving an opioid, according to the CDC. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in our country. As the President discussed with the group this morning, we won’t be able to address this academic — excuse me — epidemic with a single solution.
First, we must get struggling Americans the help that they need. Too many families have seen firsthand the destruction that drug abuse can bring, and we must also focus prevention on law and enforcement. Cheap heroin is flooding into our communities as drug cartels expand into the country, setting off a chain reaction of addiction that spreads from person to person and from family to family.
President Trump has already taken executive action to strengthen law enforcement and dismantle criminal cartels. He and his team will continue to discuss how best to root out this threat to American communities with drug enforcement experts as we continue this fight. Stopping this epidemic is not — is an issue that every American, regardless of your political background, can and must get behind. We must work together from the leaders of the most — from most local and community recovery and support programs all the way to the White House to solve this problem.
The White House took a big first step this morning in our battle to combat drug addiction and the opioid crisis by meeting with these individuals, which included New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie, who has been a leader on this issue. Attorney General Sessions, Education Secretary DeVos, Veterans Administration Secretary Shulkin, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, and others were in attendance. A full list of participants has been provided.
I will say — I know the pool was just in there — it is — some of the stories from some of the individuals who have been involved in this with a family member are unbelievably compelling. Their desire to see and to work with the administration to get this problem addressed is one that is plaguing communities, and I know the President places it at the highest priority.
There was a mention by the drug — the Acting Administrator of the DEA that they have a program where, twice a year, they gather unwanted drugs. Last year they gathered over a million pounds of unwanted drugs. There’s 5,000 sites in which people across America can drop off stuff in their medicine cabinet that is no longer used to get it out of their house. The next drop-off will be on April 29th, and I think the DEA will be putting out more information. But when you see some of the action that was taking place in this report, it is truly a call to arms for a crisis that is plaguing our country.
This afternoon the President will drop by the Women’s Empowerment Panel that the White House is hosting, led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Small Business Administrator McMahon, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma, who will all speak about the unique challenges that women and young girls face today. Vice President Pence and the First Lady will also be in attendance.
The President is proud that his administration is full of so many female leaders from who will be on stage this afternoon to those incredibly — their incredible work doesn’t always make headlines, but it’s certainly felt across the federal government and across our nation. Women’s History Month is coming to an end, but the Trump administration is committed to empowering women in the workplace. The work that we started this month will not end at the end of this month but will continue.
The President made women’s empowerment a priority throughout the campaign, speaking out on affordable childcare and paid family leave, investing in women’s health, and the barriers faced by female entrepreneurs and business owners. In February, he and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada launched the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs. This month the First Lady hosted an event for International Women’s Day in the East Wing. CMS Administrator Verma hosted a panel on women in healthcare. His daughter, Ivanka, held a roundtable with women business owners with SBA Administrator McMahon, as well as other — roundtable with Latina business owners.
And just earlier today, the First Lady joined the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, to present the 2017 Secretary of State’s International Women of Courage Award at the State Department.
The President believes, as the First Lady said this morning, “Wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them. However, wherever women are empowered, towns, villages, schools and economies are empowered, and together, we are all made stronger.” The Trump administration will continue to work to ensure that the American economy is a place where women can work and thrive.
Later this evening, the Vice President will participate in the swearing-in of David Friedman, as the next ambassador to Israel. The President is glad that Ambassador Friedman will be officially on board as we strive for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Mr. Friedman’s strong relationships in Israel will be a tremendous asset to the President in furthering that mission.
Finally, I want to speak about Judge Gorsuch and the blatantly political obstruction of his nomination to the Supreme Court by Senate Democrats. Yesterday, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that next Friday the Senate will vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. We welcome this news. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have begun justifying their opposition to Judge Gorsuch by claiming a 60-vote standard for his confirmation. That standard doesn’t exist and these claims continue to be false. A party-line filibuster by the Senate minority is not a fair up or down vote.
You don’t have to look further than the voices of many of these same Democrats to see why, in 2013, Senator Tom Udall said, and I quote in full, “Some of us may disagree with Justice Scalia on judicial philosophy, but he was a qualified nominee. He received an up or down vote and he was unanimously confirmed. Likewise,” he said, “Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was considered a liberal. The former ACLU general counsel, many on the other side may have disagreed with her views but there was no filibuster. She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3.” He added, “A minority in the Senate should not be able to block qualified nominees.” We could not agree more with Senator Udall.
Unfortunately, he has now adopted a new party line of obstruction in blocking a fair up or down vote on the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. It’s both sad and unfortunate. And we encourage all senators from both parties to fairly evaluate the judge’s eminent qualifications and grant him an up or down vote.
With that, be glad to take your questions.

1:04 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: I know the pool is gathering at 1:30 p.m., so I’m going to try and keep this on the short end.
This morning, the President held a listening session with the Attorney General and the Fraternal Order of Police with the Vice President to discuss law enforcement issues related to terrorism and inner-city violence.
The Fraternal Order of Police is the world’s largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers, with more than 330,000 members. They represent those who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving. They advocate for improved working conditions for law enforcement officers and for the safety of our communities.
The President thanked the FOP leadership for their support and reaffirmed his pledge to have our back. The President also remarked that his highest duty is the security of our people and pointed to several actions that he’s already taken to enhance our domestic security, including the creation of a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime; an Inter-Agency Task Force to Dismantle Criminal Cartels; and historic action to secure our borders and remove criminals from our country.
The group held an in-depth discussion about the rise of violent crime in some parts of the country, the disturbing increase in members of law enforcement being targeted in ambush style attacks, and the need to address the country’s opioid epidemic.
Attorney General Sessions told the FOP leadership that he looks forward to continuing to work closely with them to tackle the challenges facing law enforcement as they work to keep our communities safe.
This afternoon, as I mentioned at the top, the President will sign an executive order on energy independence at the Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters. The President strongly believes that protecting the environment and promoting our economy are not mutually exclusive goals. This executive order will help to ensure that we have clean air and clean water without sacrificing economic growth and job creation.
First, it directs all agencies to conduct a review of all regulation, rules, policies, and guidance documents that put up roadblocks to domestic energy production and identify the ones that are not either mandated by law or actually contributing to the public good.
It also rescinds a number of the previous administration’s actions that don’t reflect this administration’s priorities. The full list is laid out in the executive order, which will be provided to you later today, after the President signs it.
Next, the order directs the EPA to take several actions to reflect this President’s environmental and economic goals, including a review of the new performance standards for coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants that amounted to a de facto ban on new coal plant production in the United States.
This is great news for states like Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and others.
Finally, the order establishes a directive for agencies to use the best available science and economics in their regulatory analysis moving forward.
For too long, the federal government has acted like a barrier to energy independence and innovation. By reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles, we’ll free up American energy companies to responsibly use our vast energy resources, protecting the environment while creating well-paying jobs throughout the country.
American electricity producers have already done an amazing job of adapting and utilizing new technologies to deliver clean power to the United States. Under President Trump, the federal government is going to acknowledge that progress and adjust its policies accordingly.
Moving on, later in the afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly. And this evening, the President and the First Lady will host a reception here in the White House for senators and their spouses. This will be the first time that President Trump has invited all current senators to the White House, and he looks forward to this opportunity, as well as to speak with some of the senators about the places where they can come together and make this country better.
One of those places that he hopes to find common ground with Senate Democrats here tonight is the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Yesterday, many Senate Democrats began declaring support for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s partisan filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch. And as I’ve said, these senators should get — if these senators get their way, this would be the first successful filibuster of a nominee to join the Supreme Court.
Leading Democrats have lamented these tactics as recently as last year. Senator Schumer, in fact, wrote last year in an op-ed in the New York Daily News — and I quote — “At a time when Americans want to move forward, the last thing we need — the last thing is a new recipe for gridlock at the Supreme Court.”
Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton said of the Supreme Court confirmation progress — “[It] should not be an exercise in political brinkmanship and partisan posturing,” and that nominees deserve a “full and fair hearing followed by a vote.”
Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri tweeted “[T]he constitution says the Senate shall advise and consent. And that means having an up-or-down vote.”
So who are Senate Democrats going to enact this on in extraordinary lengths to block? It’s an individual, frankly, who their body, including Senator Schumer, unanimously confirmed for a seat on the 10th Circuit not too long ago. This is a judge who received a unanimous “well qualified rating” by the American Bar Association, was a Harvard Law graduate who received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service at the Department of Justice. So it can’t be their qualifications they’re taking issue with.
Judge Gorsuch is, frankly, a mainstream judge. Here are some figures and facts to point that out. Number one, in 98 percent of the cases in which he issued the opinion, he received the unanimous support of all of his colleagues. Second, in divided cases over the last five years involving both Republican and Democrat-appointed judges, Judge Gorsuch sided with the Democrat-appointed judge one in three times.
When the shoe was on the other foot, when a Supreme Court nominee for a Democratic President went through the confirmation hearings and meetings with senators from both parties, neither Justices Kagan nor Sotomayor faced an attempted Senate filibuster. Both received Republican votes in support of their confirmations.
In fact, during the Kagan nomination, on the Senate floor, when Senate Leader Harry Reid planned to file a cloture motion to bring Kagan to a vote, it was then-Senator and now current Attorney General Jeff Sessions who stopped him and said, “I have a high standard before I would attempt to block an up or down vote,” and asked Senator Reid to proceed with a vote without the need for overcoming a Republican filibuster.
Judge Gorsuch has met with most of the Senate Democratic caucus. He has gone through days of hearings and answered probing questions. He is eminently qualified and deserves the deference and consideration from the minority Senate Democrats that President Obama’s selections were given once they had gone through the confirmation process.
A few things I want to highlight. Last night, the President announced his intent to nominate Makan Delrahim to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Anti-Trust Divisio) at the Department of Justice.
And this morning, we announced the President’s declaration that a major disaster exists in the State of Nevada and ordered federal assistance to supplement recovery effort in the areas affected by severe storms, flooding, and mudslides this past February.
And finally, this morning, the President was pleased to see that Ford announced $1.2 billion investment in three manufacturing facilities in Michigan, just two weeks after automobile executives came to the White House and met with the President. This adds to the growing wave of positive news — jobs news under the President and continued the investment from Charter Communications, and his approval for the Keystone XL pipeline on Friday.
In addition, Energy Transfer Partners reported Monday that the Dakota Access pipeline has been filled with oil as they enter the final stages of preparation that will finally put this into service.
According to data released by the Conference Board, in March consumer confidence “soared” to its highest level in 16 years. And from individual announcements to significant boosts in both consumer and CEO confidence generally, it’s clear that the President’s economic agenda is what America’s businesses have been waiting for. These businesses have spent years being held back by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape, and what we’re seeing now is just the taste of the heights our economy can reach once those burdens are removed.
And lastly, I want to make a comment on a false report regarding former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. As a matter of fact, I’d like to walk you through the sequence of events just to make sure that everyone is abundantly clear on what happened.
On March 14th, Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff invited Sally Yates to testify on March 28th. On March 23rd, Sally Yates’s attorney sent a letter to the Department of Justice asking for their consent to testify without constraints.
On March 24th, the Department of Justice responded the President owns those privileges to discuss the communications they were requesting to talk about and referred them to the White House.
Also on the 24th, Ms. Yates’s attorney sent a letter to the White House Counsel requesting that consent, specifically stating that if they did not receive a response by March 27th at 10:00 a.m., they would “conclude that the White House does not assert executive privilege over these matters.” The White House did not respond and took no action that prevented Ms. Yates from testifying.
That’s the story. That’s what the documents show.
And with that, I’m glad to take some questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-032817/

MR. SPICER: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I hope everyone had a great weekend, seriously. It’s Monday, so I brought a special guest.
First, I’d like to have the Attorney General come up to the podium to make an announcement regarding immigration enforcement with respect to sanctuary cities. When the Attorney General is done speaking, we’ll have time for a couple questions and then I’ll continue with the briefing. So if your question is not germane to sanctuary cities, keep your hand down and we’ll get to it after we go through the events of the day.
So, with that, Attorney General Sessions, come on up.
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS: Thank you, Sean. The Department of Justice has a view to enforce our nation’s laws, including our immigration laws. Those laws require us to promptly remove aliens when they are convicted or detained of certain crimes. The vast majority of American people support this commonsense requirement. According to one recent poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities. Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate this enforcement of immigration laws. This includes refusing to detain known felons on the federal detainer request, or otherwise failing to comply with these laws.
For example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor ICE detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime. The charges and convictions against these aliens included drug-trafficking, hit-and-run, rape, sex offenses against a child, and even murder. Such policies cannot continue. They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. We all remember the tragic case of Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman who was shot and killed two years ago in San Francisco as she walked along a pier with her father. The shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions.
Just 11 weeks before the shooting, San Francisco had released Sanchez from its custody, even though Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had filed a detainer requesting that he be held in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up for removal. Even worse, Sanchez admitted the only reason he came to San Francisco was because it was a sanctuary city.
A similar story unfolded just last week, when Ever Valles, an illegal immigrant and a Mexican national was charged with murder and robbery of a man at a light rail station. Valles was released from a Denver jail in late December, despite the fact that ICE has lodged a detainer for his removal.
The American people are not happy with these results. They know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk, especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators.
DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang rapes, crimes against children, and murderers — countless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended. Not only do these policies endanger lives of every American — just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these policies also violate federal law.
The President has rightly said, disregard for the law must end. In his executive order, he stated that it is the policy of the executive branch to ensure that states and cities comply with all federal laws, including all immigration laws.
Today, I’m urging states and local jurisdictions to comply with these federal laws, including 8 U.S.C. Section 1373. Moreover, the Department of Justice will require that jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department of Justice grants to certify compliance with 1373 as a condition of receiving those awards.
This policy is entirely consistent with the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Program’s guidance that was issued just last summer under the previous administration. This guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants.
It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants.
The Department of Justice will also take all lawful steps to claw back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates 1373. In the current fiscal year, the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Program and Community Oriented Policing services anticipates awarding more than $4.1 billion in grants.
I strongly urge our nation’s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws, and to rethink these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe — public safety, as well as national security, are at stake — and put them at risk of losing federal dollars.
The American people want and deserve a lawful system of immigration that keeps us safe, and one that serves the national interest. This expectation is reasonable, just, and our government has the duty to meet it, and we will meet it.
Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-29-032717/

1:15 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. There’s a lot going on today, so I’m going to keep this on the briefer side.
This morning, the President announced the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The last administration spent eight years delaying this enormous investment in American energy independence. President Trump is moving this project forward in just eight weeks. And just as he promised, it’s an even better deal for the American people than before he took office. This project will directly generate an estimated 16,100 jobs, according to the State Department — all without spending a dime of taxpayer money.
In many ways, this project represented everything that was wrong with the infrastructure permitting of the United States. TransCanada spent an incredible amount of resources attempting to comply with government regulations, only to be denied and delayed for political reasons. But the days of pointless government bureaucracy holding up progress and production have ended. By simply getting excessive, duplicative regulations out of the way, we can make infrastructure projects more attractive — a more attractive prospect for private investors, and encourage even more projects like this one.
Immediately following the announcement by TransCanada, the President announced that Charter Communications has committed to investing $25 billion here in the United States and hiring an additional 20,000 American workers over the next four years.
Charter Communications is truly an example of how American leadership can turn a downturn entity into an amazing success.
Five years ago, Charter Communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy. Today, thanks to hard work and great leadership of Chairman and CEO Tom Rutledge, it is the fastest-growing television, Internet, and voice company in the nation. And, most importantly, as Charter grew, American jobs grew, as they brought back many jobs that had previously been shipped overseas. Today, Charter is also committed to completely ending its offshore call centers, basing 100 percent of them in the United States.
Together, the TransCanada and Charter Communications announcement demonstrate the new economic model of what the President called The American Model. By slashing job-killing regulations and reducing government burdens and lowering taxes, we will make it easier for all businesses to grow right here at home, generating jobs and boosting our economy by getting government out of the way.
Following these big announcements, the President had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. He was joined by Speaker Paul Ryan — I’ll get to in a second on that. Later in the afternoon, the President will host a Greek Independence Day celebration. And as I mentioned yesterday, at 4 o’clock he will meet with about two dozen Medal of Honor recipients to honor Medal of Honor Day, which is technically tomorrow. He’s honored to be hosting these great men and women of our Armed Services, the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known.
And obviously, later today, the House will be voting on the American Health Care Act. The current vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. The President has been working the phones and having in-person meetings since the American Health Care Act was introduced. He’s left everything on the field when it comes to this bill. The President and congressional Republicans promised the American people that they would repeal and replace this broken system.
Obamacare’s Washington-driven, one-size-fits-all plan had seven years to prove its case, and look what it’s left us with:
Skyrocketing premiums — on average, premiums for Obamacare benchmark plans increased 25 percent in 2017. Unaffordable deductibles — the two most popular Obamacare health plans have average deductibles equivalent to 10 percent and 6 percent of the median American household income. With these high deductibles, many people have, technically, insurance, but nothing that they can afford to use. Fewer choices — one in five Americans have only one insurer offering Obamacare through exchanges. And, of course, higher taxes.
Key conservative groups like the Tea Party Express and the American Conservative Union have added themselves to a long list of organizations expressing their support for the American Health Care Act because they know it’s our chance, after the American people have spent years suffering, to finally repeal and replace the nightmare of Obamacare. The President looks forward to seeing the House Republicans join with these influential voices and vote in favor of the American Health Care Act.
The President, as I mentioned, had Speaker Ryan come up here and visit with him to update him on the bill. They are continuing to discuss the way forward on this. The Speaker is updating him on his efforts. As I mentioned to you, the President has been working throughout the week on this, calling early — starting early in the morning and working till late at night, calling with members, visiting members. By our count, over 120 members have personally had a visit, call, or meeting here at the White House in the past few days. This is an extraordinary feat. The President and his team have committed everything they can to making this thing happen. And the Speaker is going to continue to update him on the way forward.
Finally, a few administrative notes here at the end. Yesterday, senior-level United States and Israeli delegations concluded four days of intensive talks with a particular focus on concrete, near-term measures to improve the overall climate in order to advance the prospects of a genuine and lasting peace between Israel and Palestine.
The United States delegation was led by Jason Greenblatt, Special Representative for International Negotiation, and included representatives of the NSC and the Department of State.
A principal focus of the discussion was specific measures that could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza, allowing the Palestinians to more fully realize their economic potential.
The two delegations also discussed Israeli settlement construction. The fact that both governments dedicated such senior delegations for so many days reflects the close cooperation between these countries and the importance that both assign to this vital task.
Last night, the President announced his intention to nominate several key additional people to the administration, including Althea Coat-zee to be Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration; William Francis Hagerty IV to be ambassador to Japan; Robert Sumwalt III to be a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.
And also this morning, of note, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia upheld the President’s revised executive order protecting the nation from foreign people who seek to do us harm into the United States. We’re pleased with this ruling, which found the plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. As the court correctly notes in its opinion, the President’s order falls well within his legal authority to protect the nation’s security. We’re confident the President’s fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the system — court system.
In terms of the schedule for this weekend, the President will spend a working weekend here in Washington, and we’ll update you with further details regarding his schedule.

1:38 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. I want to start by acknowledging, as the President did a little while ago, that a great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the terror attack in London yesterday.
Our prayers are with his family and friends. We’re aware of reports that another American citizen was injured, as well as the potential as this story continues to develop — we stand ready to provide consular assistance, but considering some privacy concerns, I’m not going to further discuss the current state of any of those individuals at this time.
As I said yesterday, the President spoke with UK Prime Minister May to offer his condolences and pledge the full cooperation and support of the United States government in responding to this attack and bringing those responsible to justice.
Now, a little bit on today’s schedule. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with over 30 members of the House Freedom Caucus to discuss building momentum towards replacing and repealing Obamacare with the American Health Care Act.
The members of the Freedom Caucus thanked the President for engaging with them throughout their negotiations, and the President, likewise, thanked the group for their willingness to work closely with the White House and their colleagues to craft the strongest possible bill. The group agreed that their ultimate goal is to implement a system that will drive down costs and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans, and this meeting was, I think, a very positive step towards achieving that goal.
This was just the latest in a series of discussions, in-person and on the phone, that the President, the Vice President and his team have had, holding with Republican House members on the American Health Care Act. This afternoon, we expect the President to continue those meetings with members of the Tuesday Group from the House, coming up here later today.
Since the law was introduced, the legislative affairs team has been in constant contact with members the American people will be counting on to fulfill their promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare by supporting this bill later tonight.
In the past few days, the President has been on the phone with scores of Republican members, in addition to the in-persons meetings you’ve seen with the Republican Study Committee, the House Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group. This bill has truly been a collaborative effort from the beginning. Through an open and deliberative process, the President and his team have helped to negotiate a very, very strong bill. He was on the phone last night well into the 11 o’clock hour with members on an individual basis, discussing their support for the bill.
The amendments that have been incorporated add important aspects to the bill, like removing costly “essential health benefit” insurance regulations; repealing Obamacare taxes immediately, starting in 2017; reforming Medicaid by allowing states to accept funding as a block grant to implement able-bodied work requirements; and blocking states from receiving enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages if they expanded during the transition.
We’ve already seen the results, with many members coming out and saying they’re going to be a “yes” tonight. As I’ve noted before, today is actually the 7th — and we hope, the last — anniversary of the day that President Obama signed Obamacare.
The President is looking forward to seeing Republicans fulfill the pledge tonight that they’ve been making to their constituents for years that, with a Republican in the White House and with them in Congress, they would once and for all see the end of Obamacare.
The President — I assume that President Obama must be feeling this time is up for his signature law, since today he came out with a rather lengthy statement about it. But he can’t change the facts about where it stands. President Obama stated that Americans received an “upgrade” in insurance. But the mandates Obamacare placed on insurance forced millions off their insurance and away from their doctor, which broke the promise that they were given.
President Obama attempted to move the goal posts on costs, downplaying the skyrocketing premiums, some in the case of over 100 percent in some places, and unaffordable deductibles. Americans — he seems to have forgotten that he pushed Obamacare on the promise of reducing costs, not making health care unaffordable.
President Obama said Obamacare isn’t — quote — in a “death spiral.” But enrollment is nowhere near expectations, and this year it’s actually declining. Insurers are fleeing the exchanges and one in three counties in America only has one insurer.
President Obama may not believe the Obamacare is a “job-killer” but the new law, including its job-killing taxes, mandates and regulations, speaks for itself. With the passage of the American Health Care Act, we will begin the process of rolling back Obamacare’s many disastrous policies.
And, of course, it’s not just a big day on the House side. Over on the Senate, we begin the final and fourth day of Judge Gorsuch’s Senate Judiciary hearings. Earlier today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced that Senate Democrats would be mounting a filibuster against his nomination.
From day one, we’ve said that the President made an inspired choice with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. The American Bar Association has given them their highest rating of “well qualified.” This week, though, through all four days, he has showcased his sterling credentials and a brilliant legal mind.
We find Senator Schumer’s announcement truly disappointing, because it breaks with the tradition of how the Senate has handled Supreme Court confirmation votes in modern time — and represents the type of partisanship that Americans have grown tired of.
In the last half-century, only three Supreme Court justices have ever faced a filibuster. The most recent — Justice Alito — was opposed by then-Senator Obama who voted to uphold his filibuster, and later admitted that his vote was a politically motivated act that he regretted. In fact, Senate Republicans didn’t filibuster his Supreme Court nominees, Kagan and Sotomayor.
We call on Senator Schumer to follow Democrats to abandon this attempt to block Judge Gorsuch from receiving a fair up or down vote that he and the American people have voted for.
Back to the rest of the President’s schedule. This afternoon, the President, as I mentioned, will meet with members of the Tuesday Group. He had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin and Nelson Peltz.
At 3 o’clock today we hope you’ll come out and join the President to welcome the truck drivers and truck company CEOs who he will be meeting with on the American Health Care Act as they arrive to the White House alongside two rather large big-rigs. One in every 16 Americans work for the trucking industry. It’s the backbone of our country’s domestic freight transportation and it moves over 70 percent of domestic freight tonnage.
But the trucking industry has suffered greatly under Obamacare. Many truckers were forced to buy healthcare plans that weren’t necessarily right for them on the exchanges. Like millions of Americans across the country, they saw their premiums rise and their options plummet. And trucking companies, classified as large employers under the law, are mandated to provide insurance that we already know doesn’t work.
Instead of imposing senseless restrictions from Washington, the President’s three-pronged healthcare reform plan will lower premiums and increase choice by increasing competition. The President looks forward to discussing how these policies, combined with forthcoming tax, regulatory and trade reforms, will provide much needed relief for the trucking industry.
Also today, the Vice President met with President Hernandez of Honduras. A readout on that meeting is available from the Vice President’s office.
And a few notes before I get to your questions. As the President noted during his first Cabinet meeting earlier this month, while many of his spectacularly qualified choices to lead his departments and agencies are already in place and taking action to fulfill the President’s ambitious agenda, there are still some important positions that have not been filled, in large part to to Senate Democrats’ obstruction. I wanted to give you a quick update on still some of the outstanding confirmations.
Secretary of Labor-designate Alex Acosta had a very successful hearing yesterday, and we expect markup next week.
Secretary of Agriculture-designate, former governor Sonny Perdue is currently appearing before the Senate Ag Committee. We expect Governor Perdue to continue to show why he’s the best choice to lead the USDA, and hopefully his markup to be scheduled in the coming days.
We also announced earlier this afternoon that Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark will be visiting the White House on March 30th. We’ll have further details on the visit in the upcoming days.
Tomorrow, the President will hose Medal of Honor recipients and their guests in celebration of Medal of Honor Day, which falls on Saturday of this year. We’ll have some more details on that event coming forward.
The President intends to be here this weekend, so as we have updates on the President’s weekend plans we will let you know as well. I’ll also note that we’ve got — coming up on a deadline related to the Keystone pipeline. We’ll have an update on that for you tomorrow.
And finally, I’m proud to announce that on April 19th, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the New England Patriots will be visiting the White House to celebrate their latest — and what will probably be a continuation of many more to come — Super Bowl win.
And with that, I will take your questions.

1:41 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First, at the top, I wanted to note that the President has been briefed on the situation in London. He just spoke to Prime Minister May, and we’ll have a readout on that situation and that call soon.
We obviously condemn today’s attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism. And we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation. The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers.
The City of London and Her Majesty’s government have the
full support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible. We will provide you with further updates as warranted and, as I mentioned, a readout of the President’s call with the Prime Minister.
Turning to the events of today — this morning, the President received his daily intelligence briefing. He stopped by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems Administrator, Seema Verma. And also, that event was attended by the Vice President and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price.
Healthcare professionals have seen the challenges of implementing Obamacare firsthand. They’re a valuable asset to the President and his team as we continue to consider and enact policies, like the American Health Care Act, that will make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.
The women who were at the roundtable today represent the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and administrators who make sure that people around the country receive the necessary preventative and lifesaving care that they need every day.
The doctors who attend to the patients in the family practices, emergency rooms, and clinics — and those who support them on the administrative and technical sides — are one of our country’s most treasured resources.
With the passage of the American Health Care Act and the rest of the President’s healthcare reform agenda, everyone, regardless of their financial situation, will be able to take full advantage of this resource.
That’s why, at last count, over 40 major associations have expressed their support for the American Health Care Act, with several of them, including the U.S. Chamber [of Commerce], the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and, just today, the National Taxpayers Union calling it a key vote.
Following his appearance at the panel, the President and his legislative affairs team hosted several members of the House of Representatives for another meeting on the American Health Care Act. The President acknowledged, as he has before, that the AHCA is only one step in the larger process of fixing the broken healthcare system created by Obamacare, but it’s an essential first step.
Undoing and fixing all of the misguided policies is going to require a holistic, multistep process. And that’s why the President and his team are fully committed to maintaining an open line of communication with Capitol Hill leadership throughout this entire process.
Throughout the weeks since the AHCA was first introduced, they have been meeting with Republican members from across the political spectrum, many of whom we’ve seen move from “no” to “yes,” as they learn more about the legislation and amendments that have been adopted. Continued coordination between administrative and legislative actions will ensure that our new healthcare system is effective and efficient.
This afternoon, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus’s Executive Committee. The President has brought in and will continue to hear from representatives of all interests as he continues to note that he is the President of all Americans. Diversity makes our nation strong, and it also means that we don’t necessarily agree on every policy item but that we continue to have a dialogue towards productive policies that help America move forward.
The President looks forward to discussing the CBC’s policy priorities and finding ways that they can work together where those priorities align.
This evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary
of State Tillerson. Today at the State Department, Secretary Tillerson hosted the foreign ministers and senior leaders of the Global Coalition working to defeat ISIS for the first meeting of the full coalition of 68 members since December 2014. This meeting follows up on the defense ministerial Secretary Mattis hosted last month in Brussels.
The coalition is united in the fight against ISIS, and this meeting seeks to accelerate international efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it holds in Iraq and Syria, while maximizing pressure on its branches, affiliates, and networks.
This meeting is a part of our whole-of-government approach to defeating ISIS. The Trump administration will use all of the tools of national power, in coordination with our international powers [partners], to cut off ISIS’s funding, expand intelligence sharing, and deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens.
Also today, over on the Hill, Judge Gorsuch [is] in his second day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his nearly 12 hours of questioning yesterday — now at least I know how someone else feels — (laughter) — the judge continued to prove himself an enormously qualified jurist that Americans will all be proud to see on the Supreme Court. It’s not surprising that Senate Democrats are failing to gain traction for any of their potshots and opposition to Judge Gorsuch. There’s simply not enough politicizing the Senate Democrats can do to hide the fact that Judge Gorsuch is an immensely qualified and thoughtful jurist with a lifelong dedication to our Constitution.
A few administrative notes here before I take your questions: Last night, we formally announced that the President will travel to Brussels for the May 25th meeting of NATO heads of state and government. During this meeting, the President looks forward to reaffirming our strong commitment to NATO and discussing critical issues to the Alliance, especially Allied responsibility-sharing and NATO’s role against — the fight against terrorism.
The President will also host NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to the White House on April 12th.
Today, the President declared a major disaster exists in the state of Wyoming and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in February.
We also announced that the President will deliver this year’s commencement address at Liberty University on May 13th.
The President is proud to call Liberty’s president, Jerry Falwell, his wife Becki and their entire family, his friends, and looks forward to celebrating the success of this amazing graduating class on such a momentous occasion.
Finally, a few minutes ago, many of you may have seen that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, gave remarks on the surveillance collected on individuals associated with the President. Let me quote him directly:
“I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in the intelligence community reporting. And third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or [of] the Trump team.”
My understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming to the White House later to brief the President on this development, and we will have a readout for that meeting once it occurs.
With that, I’ll be glad to take your questions. Mara.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-032217/

1:56 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Hi, guys. The hearing is still — Judge Gorsuch’s hearing is ongoing, and considering the significant attention, I’m going to try to keep this a little on the shorter side today.
The President is making a full day of progress towards some of his biggest promises that he’s made to the American people. This morning he met with the House Republican Conference members on Capitol Hill, ahead of the House’s scheduled vote on the American Health Care Act, which is currently scheduled for Thursday.
During the meeting, the President reminded members of the House Conference that repealing and replacing Obamacare has been a promise that Republicans have been making to voters for years.
Members have made it clear that if voters put a Republican in the White House and continue Republican majorities in the House and the Senate that we would repeal and replace this ill-advised legislation.
And for every member who pledged to the American people that they would deliver on this promise, this is really their chance. This is the repeal of Obamacare that Republicans have been working on for years, and voters have been waiting for this for some time.
On Thursday, as the House gathers on the floor and casts their votes for the ACH, it will be exactly seven years after President Obama had signed Obamacare into law. We’re hoping to make this the last anniversary Americans will have to endure Obamacare. Republicans have been working to repeal and replace this misguided law ever since. And now, under President Trump, we will finally be able to take this step towards fundamental reform of our healthcare system.
I think most Americans remember the lines that were used to sell Obamacare seven years ago: “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.” “If you like your healthcare plan, you’ll be able to keep your healthcare plan.” But for millions of Americans, those lines proved to be nothing more than empty promises. Plans that their families had relied on for years were suddenly cancelled. Premiums and deductibles skyrocketed, leaving many who had plans unable to actually use them. And insurers fled the marketplace. Nearly one in five Americans only have one insurer offering plans on their Obamacare exchange.
President Trump and Republicans in Congress will keep their promise by reforming the system once and for all. And that’s exactly what we’re doing with the American Health Care Act, which, along with the additional legislative and administrative action that is part of the three-prong approach that we continue to outline, will finally give all Americans the healthcare system they deserve, where market-based competition leads to more affordable, higher-quality care opportunities.
This is an ongoing process, and the President has made it clear to Congress that they should be open to incorporating some of the common-sense policy proposals that have been suggested by members in both chambers who share their commitment to improving the healthcare system. To that end, the House introduced several technical and policy amendments to the legislation last night, which the President acknowledged on Capitol Hill this morning.
They include: Delivering more immediate relief from Obamacare’s taxes, accelerating the repeal of these taxes from 2017 rather than from 2018, and ensuring that millions of Americans who paid Obamacare’s penalties or taxes can reclaim their hard-earned dollars from the IRS.
It’s making it easier for Americans to deduct more of the costs of their medical expenses.
Protecting life by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to help purchase insurance plans that currently cover abortion.
Giving states additional flexibility for their Medicaid program covering traditional adult and children populations, while maintaining baseline funding for elderly and disabled populations.
Giving states the ability to implement optional, reasonable work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents as part of their Medicaid programs.
Freezing Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion while allowing for a responsible unwinding, so that people who enroll before 2020 will continue to be supported by the program.
And providing a more generous reimbursement for elderly and disabled Medicaid enrollees, recognizing that those populations have unique needs that must be taken care of.
After a return to the White House from the House — speaking to the House Republican Conference, the President received his Daily Intelligence Briefing. Then the President signed S.442, the NASA Administration Transition Authorization Act for 2017, acting on another of the President’s most ambitious promise to the American people. Many may recall in his joint address, the President said of a dream.”
And with this bill, he is taking the latest step towards making that dream a reality by reiterating NASA’s mission to ensure America remains a leader in space exploration.
This bipartisan, bicameral legislation provides NASA with the full support it needs to fulfill this and many other important missions, including: supporting NASA’s plan to explore deep space and sending astronauts to Mars, including an endorsement of launching the Mars 2020 Rover. The rover will explore a site that is likely to have been habitable, seeking signs of past life and testing compelling samples and techniques for future robotic and eventual human exploration of Mars.
Reaffirming that NASA remains a fully multi-mission agency with a balanced set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight, exploration, and education.
Endorsing NASA’s continued progress towards launching the James Webb Telescope, which will be a giant leap forward in our ever-evolving quest to understand the universe, and establishing an astronaut occupational healthcare program, something that NASA has considered a priority for years.
After the bill signing, the Vice President also announced that the President will be taking action shortly to relaunch the National Space Council, which the Vice President will chair. The President was honored to sign this new bill into law so that NASA can continue its work towards making America the world leader in space exploration once again.
Also this morning, the President — the Vice President, rather, hosted a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. We provided a readout on the President’s meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday as well, and I believe there has been a readout of the Vice President’s as well.
At 3:00 p.m. this afternoon, the President will meet with members of Congress who are part of the House Tuesday Group to discuss the American Health Care Act. And this evening, the President will speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner.
Over on the Senate side of the Hill, the President’s pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch has been doing a phenomenal job in the Senate today during his first day of questioning. The judge’s eloquent testimony yesterday was widely praised from both sides of the aisle, and it’s clear that everyone agrees, from a broad spectrum, that Judge Gorsuch is a very qualified person to serve on the Supreme Court.
As the Judge noted today, “a judge is there to make sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty or meek, gets equal protection of [under] the law.” His records show that he has lived up to this commitment throughout his entire career, and he’s continuing to prove that he is exactly the type of jurist we need on the Supreme Court throughout the questioning that’s started today.
Today is also National Agriculture Day, for those who are keeping note. The world needs America’s farmers and ranchers to lead, just as the world needs America to lead. Global food demand is expected to increase by 50 to 97 percent by 2050. The world can’t afford for America’s farmers and ranchers to retreat, but the agriculture industry has met its share of challenges in recent years. While our farmers are the most efficient in the world, margins have been tightening, regulations have been multiplying, and exports, which have historically counted for over one-fifth of U.S. farm production, have been declining due to unwise trade policies.
The President promised the many people in the agriculture industry and throughout rural America that he would not allow this to continue, and he will continue to pursue policy changes that will reverse this disturbing trend.
Quickly, in terms of follow-up from yesterday, I was asked about North Korea, and I wanted to provide an update from the NSC: “The United States, in coordination with our allies, is exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, and economic measures in response to the grave and escalating threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.”
And before I open it up for questions, let me run through a few scheduling updates. Tomorrow, the President will stop by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by CMS Administrator Seema Verma. There will also be a series of meetings with members of Congress tomorrow. In the morning, the President will meet with members to discuss the American Health Care Act. And in the afternoon he will meet with congressional — members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
On Thursday, the President will have lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin before hosting a meeting with truckers and representatives from trucking companies on healthcare that we discussed yesterday. In many states throughout the country, trucking happens to be one of the largest employers, and it’s important to understand the impact of healthcare legislation on this important industry.
I’ll have updates on the weekend schedule for you hopefully tomorrow. And finally, yesterday, pursuant to the President’s executive order on interior enforcement that he signed on January 25th, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, ICE, released its first weekly list of detainee requests, which local law enforcement agencies have failed to comply with. These examples where criminal illegals who have been arrested or convicted, in many cases, of serious and violent crimes threaten public safety. In each instance, local law enforcement is refusing to cooperate with ICE in its efforts to remove illegal immigrants who have committed a crime. It is part of the President’s continued efforts to keep our communities safe.
A copy of this report is available on the ICE website that details all of the municipalities where there has been an issue and the crime that has been committed, and the person — not necessarily the person’s name, but the offense in which they were convicted for.
And with that, I’d be glad to take a few questions. Since we’re talking Supreme Court — John Roberts. (Laughter.) Come on. That was good.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/daily-press-briefing-press-secretary-032117/

1:45 P.M. EDT
MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. As you all know, the President will be speaking this afternoon in Louisville, and we’ve got an event coming up, so I’ll try to keep this relatively short to focus on — let the President focus on his message for the day.
In regard to the news of the day, this morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Bill Gates, the co-chair and trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The President and Mr. Gates talked about their shared commitment to finding and stopping disease outbreaks around the world. The President particularly commended Mr. Gates for the Gates Foundation’s work in global health and health security. Generous and innovative private philanthropy groups, like the Gates Foundation, are critical to our mission of finding the cures of tomorrow.
Also this morning, the confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee began for the President’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. As the judge will continue to show throughout this process, he’s eminently qualified for this position, with impeccable academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a proven commitment to the Constitution.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch will be questioned by each member of the panel. And on Thursday, we anticipate things to conclude with a panel of witnesses.
The President was glad to see so many people convey their support in the last few days for Judge Gorsuch. Just this past weekend, Senator Grassley, former New York Mayor Bloomberg, editorial boards from across the country, and several of his former colleagues and classmates either penned op-eds and editorials or provided comments, one way or another, stating his impeccable qualifications for the bench.
They add to the long list of jurists, politicians, and elected officials from both sides of the aisle who have already given the judge their support. The President looks forward to watching Judge Gorsuch continue to show the Senate what an extraordinary addition he will be to the bench, and is confident that he will be confirmed.
Later in the morning, the President had a meeting with Speaker Ryan, Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price, and Dr. Zeke Emanuel. Dr. Emanuel has been intimately involved in crafting healthcare policy since his work on Obamacare. Obviously, he and the President have some differing views on the best way to make healthcare affordable and accessible, but the President also strongly believes that the health and wellbeing of the American people shouldn’t always be a partisan issue, and he will continue to reach across party lines and listen to voices on this issue.
Last week he heard from individuals and families who have suffered from the disastrous results of Obamacare. He’s previously spoken to healthcare policy groups, Republican congressional leadership, and health insurance companies. This week, he and his staff will have discussions on women in healthcare while continuing an open dialogue with members of Congress. And he will be hosting even more meetings and listening sessions in the coming weeks as he works with Congress to bring commonsense reforms to our healthcare system.
The President has shown that he’s willing to hear from all stakeholders in the healthcare field, and he will continue to listen as the process on the American Health Care Act moves along and we pursue the additional legislative and administrative actions necessary.
This afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President, and as we speak he’s meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson. The Secretary just returned from an important trip to Asia. He made it clear that America is committed to our allies, Japan and the Republic of Korea, and that we expect China to increase its role in persuading North Korea to move away from nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development and toward steps to create a better future for the North Korean people.
This trip set the stage for future leader-level engagement between the U.S. and China. During this meeting, he will debrief the President on his trip.
Later this afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. The Iraqi people have been a brave and steadfast partner in our shared fight against ISIS, al Qaeda, and radicalism. The President will speak with the Prime Minister about how that partnership will help us defeat ISIS and move into a new era in which Iraq is a force for stability and peace and a prosperous Middle East.
After his bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, the President will depart the White House for Louisville, Kentucky for a Make America Great Again Rally before returning to the White House later this evening.
A few notes at the end before I take some questions.
Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin returned from a very successful trip to Europe, where he stopped in the UK for a bilateral with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and later met with 18 of his counterparts during the G20 Ministerial in Baden-Baden.
This trip gave the Secretary an opportunity to outline the administration’s priorities on a number of issues, including macroeconomic policy, financial regulation, international tax, and illicit finance. During the meetings, the Secretary and his counterparts presented a platform that will strengthen our collective work on steps to promote global growth and financial stability.
In terms of the schedule for the rest of the week — tomorrow, the President will sign S. 442, “The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017” in the morning, and make remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner in the evening.
On Wednesday, as I mentioned last week, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus.
On Thursday, the President will hold an event with truck drivers and representatives from the trucking companies and industry on healthcare and its negative impacts on their industry and livelihood, which just happens to be the largest employer in 29 states.
And on Friday, the President will hold a Greek Independence Day celebration. We’ll have further updates on all of those events later.
And finally, I want to address the House Intelligence Committee hearing that is currently happening in which the FBI director and the NSA director are currently testifying and comment to the extent that I can at this time.
This hearing, as Chairman Nunes noted, is the first of several that the House Intelligence Committee is engaged in, and the President is happy that they’re pursuing the facts in this. As has been previously reported, Director Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating Russia’s role in interfering with the election. And let me just comment briefly on that.
Following this testimony, it’s clear that nothing has changed. Senior Obama intelligence officials have gone on record to confirm that there is no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion. The Obama CIA director said so, Obama’s director of national intelligence said so, and we take them at their word.
However, there was some new information that came from the hearing that we believe is newsworthy about the intelligence-gathering process and the unmasking of Americans identified in intelligence reports, and the illegal leak of such unmasked individuals, which is a federal crime.
Director Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that certain political appointees in the Obama administration had access to the names of unmasked U.S. citizens, such as senior White House officials, senior Department of Justice officials, and senior intelligence officials. Before President Obama left office, Michael Flynn was unmasked and then illegally his identify was leaked out to media outlets, despite the fact that, as NSA Director Rogers said, that unmasking and revealing individuals endangers “national security.”
Not only was General Flynn’s identify made available, Director Comey refused to answer the question of whether or not he’d actually briefed President Obama on his phone calls and activities. Director Comey called these types of disclosures of classified information a threat to national security, and said he will investigate and pursue these matters to the full extent of law.
He also said that the leaking of classified information had become “unusually active” in the timeframe in question. It’s also important to note that both Directors Comey and Rogers told the committee that they have no evidence that votes were changed in the swing states the President had won.
I think that pretty much, until we get the ending of this hearing — I don’t know that I want to comment too much further. And with that, I’d be glad to take a few questions.

MR. SPICER: Sorry for the delay, guys. It’s budget day. I was supposed to kick this off with Director Mulvaney. He’s still on a call with the governors, and continues to host a ton of briefings today with key stakeholders. And so my goal, if this times out right, is that as we finish up, Director Mulvaney will walk in the room, right on cue, and then he will talk to you a little bit about the budget, and we’ll walk through Q&A on that. So hopefully this all works.
I’m going to skip past the part where I say “thank you, Director Mulvaney.” (Laughter.)
As the Director will say, the President’s budget blueprint keeps his promise to put America’s security first, turning his words directly into policies that restore respect for our citizens’ hard-earned tax dollars.
There were some additional non-events — non-budget events of the day. This morning, the President had a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland. Our two nations have a long history, common values, and important economic ties.
The President was honored to host him here in the Oval Office and recommit to strong social, political, and economic relations between the U.S. and Ireland.
This afternoon, the President made the remarks at the Friends of Ireland Luncheon at the Capitol. This traditional lunch celebrating America’s bipartisan commitment to peace and security in Ireland was started in 1983 by President Reagan and Speaker O’Neill — both proud Irish Americans — and has been attended by every President, Speaker, and Taoiseach of Ireland since then.
And also, while at the Capitol this afternoon, right around now, the Vice President is swearing in former Senator Dan Coats as the next Director of National Intelligence in his ceremonial office. Former Senator Coats has clearly demonstrated the deep subject — the subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community, and the President is finally glad have him on board as part of him team.
Later this evening, the President, along with Taoiseach Kenny, will attend the St. Patrick’s Day Reception and participate in the annual Shamrock Ceremony. Since 1952, the President has invited the Taoiseach to come to the White House in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day, where they present a bowl of shamrocks as a symbol of the profound and lasting relationship between the two countries. The President and Taoiseach Kenny will also make remarks.
I have a few more notes before I get to Director Mulvaney. First, I wanted to share with you guys — it’s a letter that should be going out shortly, if it hasn’t already, that the President signed this morning, wishing Ray Chavez, the oldest living survivor of Pearl Harbor, a happy 105th birthday.
Our nation owes Mr. Chavez’s generation — a Great Generation — a debt of gratitude for an extraordinary legacy of liberty and freedom around the world, fighting to ensure security and prosperity for millions. A copy of the letter will be sent out, if it hasn’t already. And obviously, we all extend our warm wishes to Ray and his family and they celebrate his 105th. And the President signed the letter wishing that he hopes to have several more birthdays to come.
This afternoon, the President announced his intent to nominate several individuals to key posts at the Department of Defense: Robert Daigle as Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation; Elaine McCusker as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense; David Norquist as Under Secretary of Defense and Comptroller; Kenneth Rapuano as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security; Patrick Shanahan as Deputy Secretary of Defense; and David Joel Trachtenberg as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.
The President is glad to have these extremely qualified men and women on board to assist Secretary Mattis as he undertakes the great rebuilding of our nation’s military.
Also this afternoon, the President declared a major disaster in the State of California and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides this January.
We also announced this afternoon that Second Lady Karen Pence will lead the Presidential Delegation to the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria.
The House Budget Committee met earlier this morning and approved the American Health Care Act, making it now the third committee to move the AHCA forward. We’re working hand in glove with the House to consider improvements, and we’re confident that this thoughtful and thorough process will lead to legislation that reforms our healthcare, making it affordable and accessible to every American.
Since we won’t have a chance to meet tomorrow in light of the President and Chancellor Merkel’s press conference, I wanted to quickly walk you through a couple of events on the President’s schedule.
Tomorrow, of course, the President will welcome German Chancellor Merkel here to the White House, a rescheduling from the snow, inclement weather that prevented that from happening the other day. The President and the Chancellor will have a series of meetings and then will host a roundtable focusing on the importance of vocational training with both American and German business leaders.
They will also have a press conference in the afternoon. We’ll have details on the entire day later this afternoon.
Also tomorrow, the President will attend a listening session with Veterans Affairs and VA Secretary Shulkin and representatives from the various Veterans Service Organizations.
It’s incredibly important to the President that we reform the VA system so that it can fulfill the promises made to the men and women who risked their lives for our nation. He looks forward to discussing potential changes that can help improve the Veterans Administration.
On Monday, the President will meet with Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft. He’ll also have lunch with the Vice President and a meeting with the Secretary of State.
Later that afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq to the White House.
And on Wednesday, the President has invited all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to come to the White House for a meeting. The President looks forward to welcoming [them] for what he hopes will be a productive discussion.
And I also want to remind everyone that — I did yesterday, via Twitter — that the lottery for the 139th Annual White House Easter Egg Roll is open until Saturday — this coming Saturday. Everyone who is interested in attending can go to Recreation.gov. Further information is at WhiteHouse.gov for details.
At his rally last night, the President addressed the decision by the federal district court in Hawaii to block his lawful executive order. As the President said last night, “The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems it to be necessary in the national interest…” The Court didn’t even bother to quote the relevant statute in its opinion, which could have plainly shown that the President clearly has this authority.
I know you’ve heard it before, but since the Court didn’t, let me quote it again for you. 8 U.S. Code 1182 states: “Whenever the President finds [that] the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he [shall] deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem [to be] appropriate.”
The Department of Justice said in a statement that they “strongly disagree[s] with the federal district court’s ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and [in] scope.” DOJ continued, “The President’s executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation’s security, and the Department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts.”
The Department is exploring all available options to vigorously defend this executive order. We intend to appeal the flawed rulings. Currently, the Department of Justice is determining the legal strategy and timing. We expect action to be taken soon to appeal the ruling in the 4th Circuit and to seek clarification of the order prior to appeal in the 9th Circuit.
The danger is real, and the law is clear. The President was elected to change our broken immigration system, and he will continue to exercise his constitutional authority and presidential responsibility to protect our nation.
And just before I get to your questions, and then before we’ll introduce Director Mulvaney, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that have come up recently.
Jon Decker asked multiple times on the enforcement of the President’s executive order to restrict lobbying activities of executive branch employees, which includes a five-year ban on lobbying agencies where you’ve served and a lifetime ban on lobbying from foreign governments.
I said I’d get back to Jon, so here we go. The executive order itself has a section, Section 5, which focuses on enforcement. The order outlines that each agency head is tasked with working with the Office of Government Ethics to establish procedures for determining potential violations of the ethics pledge. Should a violation be determined, the executive order authorizes the Department of Justice to enforce the order through several mechanisms: debarment proceedings — these would restrict an individual or his or her associated entities from doing business with the federal government; seeking an injunction, such as a restraining order from lobbying for 10 years — the five years in the ethics agreement plus an additional five years; or civil penalties such as a fine commensurate with the nature of the violation.
The President fully expects the Department of Justice to vigorously enforce this executive order.
Also yesterday several of you asked where the House is in regard to additional legislation as outlined in the third prong of the AHCA and the President’s plan to reform healthcare. I’m pleased to note that last night Leader McCarthy in the House introduced four pieces of legislation that will remove burdensome regulations, lower costs, and increase access as we’ve noted: the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, H.R. 372, which eliminates anti-trust protection for an insurance provider, creating competition so that Americans are not left with just one choice for healthcare coverage; the Small Business Health Fairness Act, H.R. 1101, which allows small businesses to band together and negotiate lower prices; the Protecting Access to Care Act, H.R. 1215, which limits frivolous lawsuits that unnecessarily drive up healthcare costs; and the Self-Insurance Protection Act, H.R. 1304, which protects workers who get their healthcare coverage from employers that self-insure by providing a backstop on catastrophic losses.
And finally, in terms of following up from yesterday, in regard to the DOJ’s indictments of Russian hackers on Yahoo data, this action demonstrates the United States’ commitment to identifying cyber criminals and bringing them to justice, no matter where they are. It also highlights the criminal importance of international cooperation to our cyber regime. And like I said, yesterday, though this is a lawful enforcement action, anything beyond that, I would direct you to the Department of Justice and the FBI for further details.
Before I continue, let me turn it over to Director Mulvaney to talk a little bit about the budget.
Director?
DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, and happy day before St. Patrick’s Day, also known as Budget Day. Most of you heard me talk about the budget before so I’m not going to say too many things in opening before we get to your questions. But we will remind you that this is what we’re calling the America First Budget. We had an America First candidate; you now have an America First President. And it shouldn’t surprise anybody that we have an America First Budget. It’s in the details, as we talked about last week — $54 billion of additional defense spending. We have some more details today on where that money is going.
We’re seeing increases at the VA, increases within the Department of Justice for law enforcement, increases within the Department of Homeland Security for things that include border security and immigration controls. Immigration is within — excuse me — increases within the Department of Energy to deal with a nuclear triad.
And then corresponding reductions in similar amounts offsetting dollar for dollar in other programs. The largest reduction if you’ve seen the budget already is a 31 percent reduction within the Environmental Protection Agency. The next largest reduction on a percentage basis is within Department of State; and the other departments are reduced in lesser amounts. I think the smallest reduction we have is NASA, which is just less than 1 percent. But there again, as with many of the agencies, you’ll see certain line items within those budgets plussed up.
This is the message the President wanted to send to the public, to the press, to Capitol Hill: he wants more money for defense; more money for border enforcement; more money for law enforcement generally; more money for the vets; more money for school choice. And then to offset that money with savings elsewhere so that all of that is done without an additional dollar added to the deficit.
As I’ve mentioned before, the budget does not balance the budget. This budget simply reallocates and reprioritizes spending as any family or business would do.
This budget does not — for those of you who were not here last week — this budget does not address the big-picture items such as policy changes, revenue flows, tax policy, mandatory spending. This is simply the topline spending budget. That’s why we call it the budget blueprint, and not the full budget. That full budget, which will contain all the rest of those pieces and parts, will be released in May.
Before I take questions, I’m going to do something I don’t ordinarily do — I’m sure it’s kind of new — I’m going to call on the New York Times because they’re in trouble. Apparently, is there a — where’s my New York Times guy? Matt Flegenheimer and Alan Rappeport — okay, are in big trouble. I’ll give you the first question but you have to deliver this message to them. They printed this morning that I am the father of 17-year-old triplet girls. My 17-year-old daughter really wishes that were happy — really wishes that had happened, but my two 17-year-old sons are upset. (Laughter.) So if you could clarify that, that would be great. And I’ll give you the first questions, if you’ve got one.
So go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-031617/

MR. SPICER: Looks like the snow didn’t keep anyone away. Good afternoon. I hope — I’m glad to see everyone made it safely in.
As you may have seen last night, the President met with D.C. Mayor Bowser and Metro general manager Wiedefeld about the preparations for the storm. The President continues to closely monitor the impact of the storm throughout the Northeast. The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has been in touch with state and local officials in the path of the storm to provide them guidance and support. As the storm continues to track the East Coast, heavy to intense snow, sleet, and strong winds could result in significant travel impacts and possible coastal flooding.
Again, the President encourages everyone to listen to their state and local leaders and public safety officers, and follow their warnings and closure notices. They are working around the clock to ensure the safety of our citizens and their families.
In light of the storm, the schedule for today changed a bit. Obviously, German Chancellor Merkel’s visit was moved to Friday. We’ll continue to provide you updates on the schedule as we grow closer to Friday.
Today, the President had lunch with the Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This afternoon, the President will swear in Seema Verma as the Administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The President looks forward to having the spectacularly qualified and experienced Administrator Verma finally onboard, especially as we continue to lay the groundwork for historic reform of our healthcare system.
Later this afternoon, the President and Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, will have a call with the CEO of Anthem Healthcare, Mr. Joseph Swedish. He will then have a phone call with Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McCarthy to further discuss the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act and a series of much-needed regulatory reforms to accompany that.
The President was glad to see the National Federation of Independent Businesses announce their support for the American Health Care Act, and FIB has previously identified healthcare along with small business taxes as their two biggest priorities, and the President’s healthcare agenda will address many of their concerns for small businesses.
Yesterday, of course, the Congressional Budget Office released their report on the American Health Care Act. I know that there have been significant concerns about the CBO report, and I want to give a little bit of context to the numbers that have been going around.
In 2013, the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have coverage under Obamacare in 2016. They were way off. They were off by 13 million people — over 50 percent. In fact, only 10.4 million people were actually covered. Reports now suggest that that number has dwindled down to 9 million. CBO coverage estimates are consistently wrong and, more importantly, did not take into consideration the comprehensive nature of the three-pronged plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act.
We’re working to bring real relief and better choices to the American family. The two other prongs of our plan contain several additional reforms that will further drive down cost and increase coverage. When you get down to it, the Congressional Budget Office is there to measure the potential impact of programs on the federal budget. Its attempts to estimate coverage have been historically faulty. But in the portion of its analysis that focuses on what the office is really about, the CBO concedes that the American Health Care Act would actually reduce the deficit by over $330 billion and bring health insurance premiums down 10 percent, even before many of the significant reforms in prongs two and three have taken effect.
And as I’ve mentioned before, some of these include expanding healthcare savings accounts, streamlining the process at FDA so that innovative and lower-cost medicines can get to patients faster, allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, which increases competition and decreases cost, permitting small businesses to band together to negotiate healthcare rates for all of their employees, and reforming the medical malpractice system so that doctors aren’t spending their time and patients’ money on unnecessary procedures.
Beyond the numbers, let’s talk about some real-life examples of the cost of Obamacare for some actual Americans who the President heard from during his listening session yesterday. Kim Sertich, a small-business owner in Arizona, had her healthcare cost skyrocket from $389.79 a month to $809.15. Carrie Couey from Colorado, a mother of six whose youngest son is autistic, saw her family’s yearly insurance go from $1,700* [$17,000] to $52,000 for a lower-quality plan. And Joel Brown, a farmer from Tennessee, saw his catastrophic coverage cost spike in the wake of Obamacare from $119 a month to more than $500 per month.
These are the stories that really matter to millions of Americans who are suffering under Obamacare, and these are the stories that are at the top of the President’s mind as he works towards reforming our healthcare system. The President is committed to working together with Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Majority Leader McConnell to create a system that’s affordable and accessible to all Americans.
Let me walk through the rest of the schedule for the week. Tomorrow, the President is headed to Michigan to meet with auto executives and workers, and will discuss how his plans for rolling back federal red tape will lead to more American jobs and higher wages, specifically in the automobile sector. It’s a great opportunity for the President to showcase moves he’s already made towards these ambitious “Buy American, Hire American” agenda, like encouraging investment and workforce training and developments so that Americans are ready for the jobs of the future, and removing the roadblocks that prevent American businesses from staying and expanding here in the United States.
The President hopes to build on the great optimism that he’s built within the business community in anticipation of the renewed opportunities the President’s economic agenda has already created. He and his team are hard at work to produce the results that the American people deserve and voted for last year.
He will also travel to Nashville, Tennessee, where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew Jackson’s tomb on his 250th birthday.
Thursday, the Taoiseach of Ireland Kenny will come to the White House for the traditional St. Patrick’s Day visit, including a reception in honor of the Taoiseach and Mrs. Kenny. And as I mentioned, German Chancellor Merkel’s visit will resume on Friday, and we will have an update on that schedule.
With that, I’m glad to take a few questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-031417/

6475,Trump,2017-03-10 05:32:00+00:00,Background Press Briefing by Senior Administration Officials on the Upcoming Visit of Chancellor Merkel of Germany,Nan,"
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I’d like to welcome all of you to this backgrounder. I’d like to start off by setting the ground rules if I can. So this is going to be backgrounder only. Attribution is going to be senior administration officials. And anything that goes on in this room is embargoed until we walk out of the room to allow us to get you the best information that we can.
We’re going to start with a brief statement and then we’ll move to a Q&A. So you can address — we’re going to introduce everybody. You can address your question up here and we’ll figure out who the best person is to answer you.
So, again, thanks for being here. And I’ll start off by allowing everyone to introduce themselves.
***
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I’ll start with just a quick statement here to lay out some of the context for this visit. So the President is very much looking forward to welcoming Chancellor Merkel to the White House on Tuesday. This will be their first meeting, and the Chancellor’s first visit to the United States in over two years.
The level of interaction between this administration and the German government has so far been frequent and robust. To name just a few interactions, Vice President Pence met the Chancellor last month in Munich. The German foreign and defense ministers were here last month as well. Secretary Tillerson was in Bonn for the G20 Foreign Ministerial last month, and Secretaries Mattis and Kelly attended the Munich Security Conference. So we’re very pleased with the level of interaction so far, and we trust that this will continue.
When he meets the Chancellor, the President will express his and the American people’s appreciation for the deep friendship that exists between the United States and Germany. We share so much history, and the bonds between our people are strong. Germany is one of our most important allies and partners in the world, and we cooperate with the Germans on everything from counterterrorism to European security to generating strong economic growth.
Germany is one of NATO’s strongest member states, and the President looks forward to talking with the Chancellor about how to strengthen the NATO alliance, including by ensuring that all allies shoulder the proper share of the burden for maintaining our collective defense. Every ally has to meet its commitments — something we know the German government believes as well. So we are heartened by the German government’s determination to reach NATO’s benchmark of committing 2 percent of GDP to defense by 2024.
The President is impressed by Chancellor Merkel’s leadership at a time when the states of the North Atlantic face a number of significant challenges, and he looks forward to consulting with her on our shared challenges.
We recognize, in particular, Germany’s leadership role, alongside France, in resolving the conflict in Ukraine and Germany’s enduring commitment to peace and stability in Afghanistan. Germany also plays a central role in the global effort to counterterrorism and violent extremism, particularly through its contributions to the counter-ISIS coalition.
The United States is committed to strengthening our political defense, security and economic relationship with Germany and with Europe more broadly. We will continue to stand together with the German people, and we are looking forward to Chancellor Merkel’s visit on Tuesday.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/background-press-briefing-senior-administration-officials-upcoming-visit-chancellor-merkel-germany/

MR. SPICER: Good morning. First off, I want to acknowledge, as the President did this morning, that today is International Women’s Day. It’s also Women’s History Month. We’re going to be holding several events throughout the month here at the White House to honor and celebrate women and how their vital contributions have and continue to be to our society, our economy, our family and our businesses.
The President tweeted this morning about the surge in hiring in the two months that he’s been in office. LinkedIn’s workforce reports say January and February were the strongest consecutive months for hiring in over a year and a half. A new report from ADP and Moody’s showed strong private job growth that is far exceeding market expectations. And just this morning, Samsung confirmed that it’s planning a “major investment” in U.S. production facilities, directly citing the President’s election as an influence in their decision. The initial investment is expected to reach around $300 million.
We keep seeing that the wave of optimism in growth in the wake of the President’s pledges to help American businesses continues to produce real results for people throughout our nation.
Yesterday I forgot to — there are a couple of things that I didn’t get to yesterday, so let me mention a couple of those. Yesterday afternoon, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, and senior White House staff met with several veteran service organizations — included in what is commonly referred to as the Big Six — to discuss the President’s commitment to helping our veterans and modernizing our VA. The meeting represented another step in fulfilling the President’s promise to the men and women who have served our nation so honorably. I know the President looks forward to personally following up on that meeting with the VSOs.
Also last night, the President named several individuals whom he intends to nominate or appoint to key administration posts: Courtney Simmons Elwood, General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency; Noel Francisco, Solicitor General at the Department of Justice; Jeffrey Rosen, Deputy Secretary of Transportation; John J. Sullivan, General Counsel for the Department of Defense; Ajit Pai, member of the Federal Communications Commission; and Tony Sayegh, Jr., the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Treasury.
Expect further announcements as the week goes on.
Now, on to the events of the day. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder and president of Emerson Collective, an organization dedicated to removing the barriers that unfortunately prevent some in the world from achieving their full potential. They discussed education and immigration policy, which are two of the areas that Emerson Collective focuses on.
Then the President held a strategic affairs lunch, focused on infrastructure with leaders in the private sector. Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride. But now, an overbearing, ineffective regular system can keep projects in limbo for years. The President has already started removing the regulatory roadblocks that have been killing projects before they’ve even begun through his executive actions, streamlining the permitting process and calling for each agency throughout the government to identify regulations that cause undue burden.
As the President has said many times, strong public-private partnerships will also be key to revitalizing our country’s ruined roads, crumbling bridges and outdated airports. The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers’ money on inefficient and misguided projects. By looking at infrastructure from a businessperson’s perspective, as the President and these executives do, we can restore respect for the taxpayer dollar and make the best investment.
The President was particularly pleased to be holding this meeting now that Secretary of Transportation Chao, EPA Administrator Pruitt, and Energy Secretary Perry are all confirmed and getting to work. In attendance at the lunch, as I mentioned, were Secretary Chao, Secretary Perry, Administrator Pruitt, and then Richard LeFrak, CEO of LeFrak; Steve Roth, the CEO of Vornado Realty Trust; Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management; Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Lynn Scarlett, the managing director of the Nature Conservancy; Tyler Duvall, the partner of McKinsey; and Elon Musk of SpaceX.
Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Congressman Elijah Cummings to discuss rising prescription drugs prices. I know the President is looking forward to continuing the dialogue that they started a few weeks ago on the phone.
At 4:00 o’clock, the President will meet with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Sullivan of Alaska. They’re expected to discuss the priorities of the Department of Interior, especially as it pertains to the government-owned lands in Alaska.
This evening, the President will meet with conservative leaders about health care. We’ll have more details and participants on that meeting a little bit later this afternoon.
The President and the Vice President continue to reiterate their support for the House bill on Obamacare repeal and replace, and look forward to working with Congress to institute a new healthcare system. Tonight, the President will have dinner with Senator and Mrs. Cruz.
And finally, a couple of additional administration announcements. Today, the President and the First Lady announced the initial details for the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll taking place on Monday, April 17th. They are honored to continue the traditions of the past while creating new ones that will play a lasting role in the fabric of our nation’s history. Tickets to the Easter Egg Roll are free to the public and will be allotted through an online lottery. Further details on the lottery and information on that day will be released later this month. Keep an eye on WhiteHouse.gov for updates on that.
I’m also pleased to announce — and a little bit proud — that Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland will be visiting the White House for the traditional St. Patrick’s Day visit on March 16th. We’ll have further details on that visit, as well as the other foreign leader visits later this week.
With that, some questions.

6488,Trump,2017-03-07 08:36:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,Nan,"
MR. SPICER: Hey, guys. I brought a guest. Good afternoon. First off, at the top, I want to acknowledge that there’s been an additional wave of threats to Jewish community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices. According to some reports, there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions since the start of this year alone.
As the President said at the beginning of his joint address, “We’re a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms. We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms.”
It is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you, and I share the President’s thoughts that he fervently hopes that we don’t continue to have to share these reports with you. But as long as they will — as long as they do continue, we’ll continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop them.
Now, on to news of the day. You saw President Trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises: protecting the country against radical Islamic terrorism, and repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative.
We talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the United States yesterday. And so, on to Obamacare. I’d like to introduce the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Dr. Price.
SECRETARY PRICE: Thanks, Sean. Good afternoon. First, let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I’m the third physician out of 23 individuals who’ve had the privilege of serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And we take that mission very, very seriously.
And for many Americans, right now, their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge. For most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It’s about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won’t be a penalty for not purchasing coverage. For the folks in the Medicare system, there will be no changes at all in the current law. But we’re talking about those people in the individual and small-group market, the moms and pops, the folks who run the corner grocery store, the corner cleaners. Those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverage.
And then Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care, and we want to make certain that we address that.
This is about patients. This is not about money. This is not about something else. This is about patients. And sadly, the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and small-group market. The access is going down, and it’s only getting worse. You know the stories. Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year, on average. Arizona had an increase of 116 percent. Deductibles are going up for many, many folks. If you’re a mom or a dad out there and you make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, your deductible in this market, in that individual and small-group market, oftentimes is $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 a year.
What that means is you’ve got an insurance card but you don’t get care because you can’t afford the deductible. And we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the care.
A third of the counties in the United States — one-third of the counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. One insurer is not a choice. So we need to make certain that we correct that.
In Tennessee this morning, it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Insurers are leaving the market on the exchange. Last year there were 232 insurers that were providing coverage — that were offering coverage on the exchange; now there are 167. That’s a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone. And all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they need.
Now, the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability, we want a system that’s affordable for everybody. Accessibility, we need a system that’s accessible for everybody. A system that’s of the highest quality, a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system, and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountability.
The President spoke last week, last Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, and he laid out his principles. First, wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market. Nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosis.
In terms of affordability, health savings accounts — growing choices for patients is incredibly important. Tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, not that the government forces them to buy. We’ve always talked about — in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place, that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage.
Those, again, in the employer-sponsored market, they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage. Those folks that are out there in the individual and small-group market, no tax benefit. And that’s what this plan would do.
State flexibility. It’s incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is, have the flexibility, especially in the Medicaid program, to be able to respond to their vulnerable population.
Lawsuit abuse. The President mentioned, and it’s incredibly important, that — the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year, and we need to make certain that we’re addressing that as well. The President also talked about a glide path, an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country, and that’s important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks.
Buying across state lines, buying insurance across state lines. The President talked about this on the campaign over and over. The American people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines, and it increases competition. And we need to make certain that that happens, and then addressing the incredible increase in drug prices.
There are three phases of this plan. One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives. That’s the start of all of this. Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place. As you all well know, the previous administration used regulations to a fare-thee-well — in fact, there were 192 specific rules that were put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5,000 letters of guidance and the like. And we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients, then we need to continue them. If they harm patients or increase costs, then obviously they need to be addressed. And then there’s other legislation that will need to be addressed that can’t be done through the reconciliation process.
So the goal of all of this is patient-centered healthcare, where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions, and not the federal government. We commend the House for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process.
And I look forward to a few questions. Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-030717/

1:43 P.M. EST
MR. SPICER: Wow, that’s a crowd. I hope everyone had a great weekend. Good afternoon. Before I begin, I wanted to introduce the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to talk to you a bit about the President’s budget. When Director Mulvaney is finished, we will allow him to take a few questions and then resume the briefing and all the fun that goes with it.
So without any further ado, Director Mulvaney.
DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks very much. I want to talk for a few minutes about the budget blueprint that most of you know the President started speaking about this morning with the governors. I’ll talk a little bit about what it is and what it isn’t, and then talk about where we are in the budget process and what it looks like from here.
First of all, what this isn’t: This is not a full-blown budget. That will not come until May. So you’re not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan. This blueprint was never going to be that, as I made clear during my Senate confirmation. It is a topline number only.
As for what it is, these are the President’s policies, as reflected in topline discretionary spending. To that end, it is a true America-first budget. It will show the President is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he ran for office. It prioritizes rebuilding the military, including restoring our nuclear capabilities; protecting the nation and securing the border; enforcing the laws currently on the books; taking care of vets; and increasing school choice. And it does all of that without adding to the currently projected FY 2018 deficit.
The top line defense discretionary number is $603 billion. That’s a $54-billion increase — it’s one of the largest increases in history. It’s also the number that allows the President to keep his promise to undo the military sequester. The topline nondefense number will be $462 billion. That’s a $54-billion savings. It’s the largest-proposed reduction since the early years of the Reagan administration.
The reductions in nondefense spending follow the same model — it’s the President keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do. It reduces money that we give to other nations, it reduces duplicative programs, and it eliminates programs that simply don’t work.
The bottom line is this: The President is going to protect the country and do so in exactly the same way that every American family has had to do over the last couple years, and that’s prioritize spending.
The schedule from here — these numbers will go out to the agencies today in a process that we describe as passback. Review from agencies are due back to OMB over the course of the next couple days, and we’ll spend the next week or so working on a final budget blueprint. We expect to have that number to Congress by March 16th. That puts us on schedule for a full budget — including all the things I mentioned, this one does not include — with all the larger policy issues in the first part of May.
So with that, I’ll take a couple questions.
Yes, sir.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-022717/

MR. SPICER: I was thinking about not doing a briefing today, and then I saw Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon give that talk and I thought they were infringing on my ratings, so we figured we had to do something to keep up our record.
It’s been another busy day today. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President welcomed some of the world’s top business and manufacturing leaders to the White House to continue the administration’s effort to engage with the private sector to create jobs and expand opportunities for America’s workers. The 24 CEOs spent the morning in working sessions with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides, and came together with the President to brief him on their discussions and recommendations.
The group discussed the need to roll back burdensome regulations that are stifling economic growth. The CEOs thanked the President for the actions that he’s already taken to address the issues, and the President pledged to do even more, both through the executive branch and by working with Congress to pass legislation that will help further economic growth and job creation.
The business leaders recommended that the administration take a multifaceted approach to tax and trade policies, including tax reform, toward which Secretary Mnuchin said that progress is continuing to be made. The President committed to working to lower taxes and level the playing field with other countries when it comes to trade and taxation.
The group held a lengthy discussion about the need to invest in the American worker to prepare for the manufacturing jobs of the future, especially the key role of vocational schools in training the workforce of the 21st century. The CEOs and administration officials agreed that public-private partnerships will be the cornerstone of a robust plan to rebuild the nation’s crumbling infrastructure. The President committed to streamlining a permitting process that is holding back so many key projects.
At the end of the discussion, the group expressed their excitement for having a true partner in economic growth in the White House, and Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical, even said that this is probably the most pro-business administration since the Founding Fathers. The President conveyed his intention to assemble the industry leaders on a regular basis to discuss progress towards these important goals. A full list of the participants is available.
This afternoon, the President spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau by phone. We’ll have a readout on that call soon. Right now, many of you just came from the President, who is involved in another listening session with leaders in the fight against domestic and international human trafficking, including representatives from International Justice Mission and United Way. Their expertise will be invaluable to the President as he engages with members of Congress to raise awareness about, and push through, legislation aimed at preventing all forms of the horrific and unacceptable practice of the buying and selling of human lives.
Human trafficking is a dire problem, both domestically and internationally. And solving this epidemic is a huge priority for the President. Dedicated men and women from across the federal government have focused on this for some time, and the President is committed to continue working with these organizations and departments. A participant list for this listening session is also going to be available.
The President this evening will attend a dinner with the Business Council.
Today in Mexico, Secretaries Tillerson and Kelly had productive meetings at the Cabinet level with officials from the Mexican government. They were forward-looking meetings focused on finding common-ground ways to advance both of our countries’ security and economic wellbeing. Both sides had a candid discussion on the breadth of challenges and opportunities as part of the U.S.-Mexico relationship.
The conversation covered a full range of bilateral issues, including energy, legal migration, security, education exchanges, and people-to-people ties. The parties also reiterated our joint commitment to maintaining law and order at our shared border by stopping potential terrorists and dismantling the transnational criminal networks that are moving drugs and people into the United States.
Under this President there is no mistaking that rule of law matters along both sides of our border. Both Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are meeting with President Peña Nieto this afternoon. That will be a continuation of the productive dialogue that is setting our two countries down a pathway to greater security and long-term prosperity.
Looking ahead to our upcoming schedule, tomorrow the President will welcome President of Peru for a working-level visit. The President of Peru is in town for a separate visit and requested a meeting with the President. There will be a spray at the top of that. Further guidance will be provided later today. The President will also speak at CPAC tomorrow. I know the President is looking forward to addressing this group of conservative-committed individuals.
Our nation’s governors are starting to gather in Washington this week for a meeting of the National Governors Association. The President and the First Lady will welcome the governors to the White House on Sunday evening. The Vice President and members of the Cabinet will also be in attendance. While the governors are in town, they will be meeting with members of the Cabinet, White House staff, and other Secretaries including Kelly, Price, and Secretary Chao have also set up a series of meetings.
The President, Vice President, and senior White House staff will also participate in a portion of the business session of NGA’s winter meeting that takes place on Monday morning.
Next week, of course, the President will give a joint session address before both Houses of Congress. He’s currently working closely with the speechwriting team on presenting his vision to Congress and the American people. I’ve got a few updates that I want to just — as we’re now a few days out. The theme of the address will be the renewal of the American spirit. The address will particularly focus on public safety, including defense, increased border security, taking care of our veterans, and then economic opportunity, including education, job training, healthcare reform, jobs, and tax and regulatory reform.
With that, I’d be glad to take a few of your questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-022317/

MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to wait until the President finished up with his remarks on the budget before I came out. As you saw, he’s — a really good opportunity to sit down with his team. It’s clearly been a busy day here at the White House again, so I’m going to kind of keep it quick and get to your questions.
This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Secretary of State Tillerson. As you all know, Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly will travel to Mexico City later today as one of their first foreign trips. It’s significant that the President is sending the secretaries to Mexico so early in the administration.
It’s symbolic of the meaningful relationship that our two nations have. These are important meetings regarding the President’s agenda to improve the quality of lives for both people of Mexico and the United States by combatting drug traffickers and finding ways to bolster both our economies through a broader relationship that promotes commerce and legal immigration. This is a very encouraging start to a working relationship with an incredible neighbor to the south.
At this moment, the President has just wrapped up his discussions on the federal budget with some of the officials and staff who will be instrumental in the work to put this country back on a responsibly fiscal path.
Joining the meeting were Reince Priebus, the Chief of Staff; Steve Bannon; Jared Kushner; Gary Cohn, the Director of the National Economic Council; Secretary Steve Mnuchin of the Department of Treasury; Director Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget; Russ Vought of the Office of Management and Budget; and Emma Doyle of Office of Management and Budget.
As the President mentioned last week, we look forward to presenting our tax reform plan and providing much-needed tax reform and relief to the hardworking men and women of our nation. The President is going to restore and respect the American taxpayer by enabling them to keep more of their hard-earned money, and by making sure the federal government spends money more responsibly. After the lunch, the President will continue this important discussion with other members of the senior staff.
Additionally, the Vice President today is in St. Louis to participate in listening sessions with American workers and employees of the Fabick Cat equipment and engineer* [engine] dealer, a 100-year-old family-owned and operated business.
During his visit, the Vice President will discuss the economic comeback in store for our nation under the President’s economic agenda and with small business owners and employees. The President has already made strides towards slashing redundant regulations through his executive actions, and we will work with Congress to enact further pro-growth legislation.
Back to the President’s schedule. Later this afternoon, the President will participate in his standing legislative affairs strategy session. Our legislative affairs team is in constant contact with our counterparts on the Hill, keeping an open dialogue on all aspects of the President’s agenda. Last week alone, more than 40 different senators and members of Congress visited the White House.
On the Supreme Court front, so far Judge Gorsuch has met with 58 senators — 36 Republicans and 22 Democrats — and he has more meetings already on the books for next week when the Senate returns to session. We’ve been especially encouraged by the reception he’s received from several senior Democrats, including Senators Feinstein, Tester, Durbin, and Gillibrand.
Also on the confirmation front, multiple unions came out today for Alex Acosta, the President’s nominee for Labor Secretary. Both the Laborers’ International Union of North America and the International Union of Operating Engineers praised his distinguished career and pledged their support for his nomination.
The legislative affairs team is using the congressional work period to coordinate with key coalitions in Congress. They are meeting with different groups in the House and Senate, including the staff of the Congressional Black Caucus, House and Senate leadership, and staff throughout various committees. We’ve used this work period as an opportunity to invite staffers from both sides of the aisle to come to the White House and discuss shared priorities and find common ground on the way forward.
And we’re not just reaching out to Capitol Hill, we’ve actively engaged with key leaders and policymakers around the country. It’s critical to this administration that we gather input from states and from people throughout the country, rather than just leaders here in Washington.
Looking ahead to tomorrow, the President will meet with a group of world-class business leaders to discuss specific actions he can take to remove barriers to job creation. These leaders, many of whom represent some of the country’s largest manufacturers, will begin the day in working groups with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides of the President’s staff. The working groups will engage in a deep-dive conversation on the attendees’ specific areas of expertise. Topics of discussion include deregulation, tax and trade, training and the workforce of the future, and infrastructure.
Vice President Pence will be engaged with each of the groups. And after the groups conclude their discussion, the President’s staff will compile the feedback and the President will sit down with the entire group for a listening session on some of their recommendations.
As you can tell by the structure of the meeting, the President is expecting these interactions to lead to real action being taken by the administration. Creating a dynamic and booming economy that works for all Americans continues to be at the top of his domestic policy agenda. As a successful businessman himself, the President knows that if we’re going to get the country back to work, we need to hear directly from job creators what is holding them back, and, where appropriate, take steps to remove the barriers.
In his first month in office, the President has already taken numerous actions to boost job creation, and key economic indicators are showing that it’s working. CEO and [consumer] confidence are up, the stock market continues to reach record highs, and the January numbers were strong. The meetings on Thursday will continue to build on that momentum.
And with that, I’m glad to take some questions. Steve Holland.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-022217/

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Happy Valentine’s Day.  I can sense the love in the room.  (Laughter.)
First off, last night, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control — OFAC — labeled the Venezuelan Vice President as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act.
Before I continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions, I want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questions.
Secretary Mnuchin.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office.  Yesterday, the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.  El Aissami’s primary frontman, Venezuelan national Samark Lopez Bellow was also designated.
These designations follow a multi-year investigation into El Aissami’s criminal activities.  And President Trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the Department of Treasury, the Department of State, as well as the National Security Council and many people throughout law enforcement.
Following the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels, this action demonstrates the President’s seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the United States.  In addition, he wants to send a clear message to the people of Venezuela that America stands with them.
And with that, I’m happy to take two or three questions specifically about this.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-021417/

6622,Trump,2017-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,Nan,"

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Just a few minutes ago, as many of you had seen, we had another example of the real-world results that the Trump administration is getting in its pro-jobs agenda.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that his company is opening a high-tech manufacturing facility in Arizona that will create roughly 10,000 jobs between the factory itself and its supply chain, which is the latest wave in economic optimism that’s sweeping the country following the President’s victory.
In his inaugural address, the President laid out an ambitious vision to create 25 million jobs over the next decade.  From the beginning of his campaign, bringing jobs back to our struggling community has been one of the parts of the President’s message that most resonated with the American people.  Having hired tens of thousands of people himself, the President is keenly aware of what prevents businesses from being successful and creating jobs in the current economy.
President Obama, by contrast, visited the same factory site where this factory will be built during his last reelection visit in 2012, touting the government incentives that were supposed to bring back jobs that had been lost to Asia.  President Trump knows that for business, the real government incentive is the government restraining itself.  For too many years, Washington has smothered industry in this country and under burdensome regulation.  This administration will set out to free businesses from constraints of government bureaucracy and regulation.
Under the President’s “Buy American, Hire American” agenda, the government is going to get out of the way of businesses to allow them to thrive.  Just last week, the President signed what we’ve been calling the “one in, two out” executive order requiring that every new federal regulation that’s adopted, two be eliminated.  This new rule will provide much-needed relief for businesses who have been regulated and saddled with an absolutely staggering amount of additional red tape, as much as $1.9 trillion per year by some estimates.
In 2014, the National Association of Manufacturers calculated that companies in every industry paid an average of $9,991 per employee to comply with federal regulations.  And it’s only gotten worse since that study was conducted.  By relieving even a small portion of this burden, we will allow businesses to grow and hire more people.  Projects that have been stalled or scuttled are being revived in anticipation of the President’s pro-growth policies.  Last quarter, confidence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies jumped by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey, one of the single-largest quarter gains in history.  This is only the beginning of the President’s agenda.
Moving on to recap the President’s afternoon and evening yesterday, as you saw, we officially announced the 24 people who will be serving in the President’s — in his Cabinet, on the White House website yesterday.  The President looks forward to having all these distinguished qualified men and women in place as heads of departments and agencies so that our government can start fully working for the American people and enacting the agenda that he brought forward during the last campaign.
The President spoke with two foreign leaders yesterday.  During his call with President Rajoy of Spain, the two leaders discussed our shared priorities, including efforts to eliminate ISIS.  The President additionally reiterated the United States’ commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and emphasized the importance of NATO allies and sharing the burden of defense spending.  President Trump also spoke with President Erdogan of Turkey, during which he conveyed U.S. support to Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally, and welcomed Turkey’s contributions to the fight against ISIS.
Last night, the President had an incredibly meaningful visit with current officers who enrolled in the Green Beret’s Qualifications Course.  These young men and women will be at the tip of the spear serving our country in some of the world’s most dangerous places as intelligence officers.  The President told these brave young soldiers how proud he was of their commitment, to risk everything to keep us safe, and how humbled he was to serve as their Commander-in-Chief, and that they could always count on him to have their back.
Also, yesterday, the Department of Justice presented its arguments before the 9th Circuit Court in the case concerning the temporary restraining order on the President’s national security executive order.  Again, as I did yesterday, I want to emphasize that the issue before the 9th Circuit right now is extremely narrow.  The question is simply whether or not the President’s executive order, which we maintain is fully lawful under the Constitution and U.S. code, should remain in effect while the courts actually consider it on its merits.  We expect the court to issue a decision on this matter soon, and we will have a statement once that’s done.
Today, the President spoke before the Major Cities police chiefs and the Major County Sheriffs Winter Conference.  In his remarks, the President reiterated his commitment to a great national partnership between his administration and law enforcement.  While there are many things that the federal government can do to improve safety in our communities, it truly rests with the police officers, sheriffs and deputies who risk their lives every day on our streets.  And their mission is critical to the future of this country.  These brave men and women have a true friend in the White House.  And as the President said many times, we must protect those who protect us.  He will continue to do that throughout his administration.
Later this afternoon, the President will participate in a standing legislative strategy meeting of his team here.  The team has been working around the clock to engage lawmakers and get the President’s agenda moving through Congress.
Yesterday, the Vice President attended the Republican Policy lunch where he discussed how the administration will work with the Senate to deliver results for the American people.
Of course, the Vice President also cast a historic vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on the floor of the Senate, and then later swore her in in his office across the street.
The larger intergovernmental affairs team is maintaining direct communications to state, local and tribal leaders so that we know what issues are affecting local communities.  So far, they’ve contacted all GOP state speakers of the house, state senate presidents, and attorneys general, and all but eight GOP state Senate majority leaders.
Our legislative team is also obviously engaged in Judge Gorsuch’s nomination.  He had another full day of meetings in the Senate with both Republicans and Democrats.  He met this morning with Senators Flake and Heitkamp.  And this afternoon he’ll meet with Senators Cotton, Blumenthal, McCaskill and Heller.  We’re also pleased to see another Democrat, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, come out and say that the eminently qualified Judge Gorsuch deserves an up or down vote.  That brings up now to nine total Democrats who have come out and expressed a willingness to treat Judge Gorsuch fairly.  We hope more Democrats will continue to join their colleagues in fulfilling their constitutional duty to offer advice and consent on the President’s nominee.
Also, on the Hill, we expect Attorney General-designate Sessions to receive a full vote on the floor of the Senate tonight.  As unfortunately has become commonplace in the Senate, Democrats once again spent hours last night in a counterproductive discussion about one of President’s clearly qualified nominees, not to mention one of their peers.  Senator Sessions has a long and distinguished legal career, serving as both the U.S. attorney of the southern district of Alabama, and also as Alabama’s attorney general.
The President looks forward to Senator Sessions’s return to the Department of Justice where he will continue his service to our nation as our chief law enforcement officer.  We also anticipate votes later this week on Secretary-designate Price and Mnuchin.
Finally, before I open it up for questions, the White House has spoken with the governor of Louisiana about the severe where in the Gulf Coast.  We’ve also made contact with the mayors of the affected areas.  FEMA is monitoring the situation around the clock and is in the process of deploying teams to support response and recovery activities.  At this time, there have been no additional requests for federal assistance, and we’ll update you should that change.
With that, let me go to the first question from Courtis Fuller from WLWT NBC in Cincinnati, Ohio.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-020817/

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Just before I came up, I wanted to let you all know that we’re monitoring the severe weather that’s going through Louisiana at this time.  The President is aware of the situation and is going to be reaching out to local and state officials throughout the day.
Also, yesterday evening, the President concurred with the FEMA Administrator’s recommendation to approve Governor Bryant’s request to add public assistance to the previously issued major disaster declaration in Mississippi.  Per the Governor’s request, public assistance will be added for three counties — Forrest, Lamar, and Perry.
Yesterday, the President had an amazing day at MacDill Air Force Base, where he met with leaders of both Special Operations Command and Central Command, and then had lunch with enlisted servicemembers thanking them for their service and hearing the ideas that were on their mind.
The President announced his intent to make historic financial investment in the armed forces of the United States, showing the entire world that America has the back of all those who stand in defense of freedom.  As he has said many times before, the armed forces are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and we must protect those who protect us.
The President kicked off today with a listening session of county sheriffs from around the country.  The President welcomed leaders from the National Sheriffs’ Association to the White House and pledged to work closely with all members of the law enforcement community to keep the American people safe.  He assured the sheriffs that the Trump administration will make every effort to stop drugs and crime from flowing into the country, put an end to the opioid epidemic, secure the borders to keep terrorists out, and strengthen the bonds between state, local and federal law enforcement agencies.
The sheriffs thanked the President for what they described as his “unprecedented” level of support for law enforcement and offered their full backing of his border security and immigration policies.  They expressed how encouraged they have been by the pro-law enforcement atmosphere that has swept the country in the wake of the President’s victory.
They also presented a letter on behalf of the National Sheriffs’ Association, thanking the President for his “recent show of support for law enforcement, specifically on immigration and border security issues” and commending the President’s two executive orders for taking “significant steps to enhancing public safety.”
The group engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the issues facing the law enforcement community, which the sheriffs said was an opportunity they hadn’t been given under the previous administration.  The sheriffs closed the meeting by thanking the President for defending the rule of law.  And the President took them to the Oval Office to honor them and show his appreciation for their outstanding work they do to keep our communities safe.
A list of the attendees is available for those who are interested.
After that meeting, the President held another listening session on how to best fix the VA.  It’s a top priority for the President and this administration to ensure that veterans get the care they need when and where they need it.  Tragically, many of our veterans are being failed by a system that does not work.  This administration will reform and modernize the VA under the leadership of Dr. Shulkin, creating a culture of accountability that puts our veterans first.
The President welcomed the group to the Roosevelt Room and expressed his intention to take whatever steps are necessary to improve health care access and quality for our heroic veterans. Ms. Tiffany Smiley, the wife of a veteran who was blinded by an IED, detailed her family’s difficulty and experience with the VA health care system, and offered suggestions to how it could be improved.  The President, VA Secretary-designate Dr. David Shulkin, and a group of health care experts and veterans advocates, including Ike & Laura Perlmutter, engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on reforming the VA so that the needs of veterans come first.
The experts discussed private sector solutions and innovations that could be used to improve the VA.  The President praised the Secretary-designate for his commitment to veterans and thanked the group for their willingness to serve and do what was best for our veterans.  They plan to meet on a regular basis to discuss their collective efforts to improve the VA and its health care system.
Also this afternoon, the Vice President had a big day on Capitol Hill, where he cast a historic deciding vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.  The President believes strongly that our nation’s success depends on the education of our students.  And Betsy DeVos has devoted nearly three decades of her time and talent to promoting educational opportunity.  As Secretary, she will ensure that every student has access to a good school, whether it’s public, private, parochial, charter, or any other kind.
The fact that we had to get to the point where the Vice President had to be pulled in to overcome the Democrats’ historic and partisan logjam of the President’s qualified nominee is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that Senate Democrats have engaged in throughout this process.
The American people sent a strong message when they elected President Trump in November:  They’re fed up with business as usual in Washington.  Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the President enacting an agenda that put him into office.
Last week, I noted the President had a fair amount of Cabinet-level appointees awaiting a full vote by the Senate.  We’re looking forward to seeing more of the President’s picks to lead agencies and departments confirmed in the upcoming week, despite these childish tactics of the Democrats in the Senate, who would rather keep the failed status quo than allowing to put the President’s people in place.
Also on the Hill today, Judge Gorsuch continues a full week of meetings with Republican and Democratic senators.  Yesterday, he met with Senators Tester and Feinstein.  Today he will meet with Senators Sasse, Schumer, Crapo, and Thune.  The President is looking forward to a full hearing for the judge, followed by an up or down vote on this incredibly qualified nominee.
At this moment, the President is meeting with Congressman Jason Chaffetz to discuss how to work together to enact his reform agenda.  Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson.  The President was obviously pleased to welcome and confirm — swear in Secretary Tillerson in the Oval Office last week, and he’s pleased that the Secretary is now able to bring his unique skillset and deep insights to the important work of the State Department.
Following his discussion with Secretary Tillerson, the President will have calls with Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain and President Erdogan of Turkey.  We’ll of course have readouts of both of those calls when they’re completed.
This evening, the President will host young officers from the United States Army Special Forces Qualification Course in the Oval Office.  As the President said yesterday, members of our military and their families are our nation’s heroes.  It is one of his top priorities to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces have the tools, equipment, and resources they need to execute their mission successfully.  The President is looking forward to conveying his gratitude and support to these young brave captains.
Later this evening, around 6:00, 9th Circuit Court will hold oral arguments, per its order from yesterday.  I want to quickly run down what we can expect to happen tonight.  A career attorney from the Department of Justice will present an argument in defense of the President’s order.  And to be clear, all that’s at issue tonight is the hearing — is an interim decision on whether the President’s order is enforced or not until the case is heard on the actual merits of the order.  It’s a simple status quo versus anti-status quo decision.
This is just like the case in Boston, which started as a temporary restraining order.  There, once we were able to explain our position, the court lifted the order and held that the President’s executive order could take effect.  As I have stated before, 8 U.S. Code 1182 gives the President constitutional authority for this executive order.  It says, “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions which he may deem to be appropriate.”  We look forward to a final decision on the merits of this soon.
Looking ahead, I know a few have been asking for more details on Prime Minister Abe’s visit later this week.  As previously announced, he will visit the White House for meetings on the 10th of February.  The President has also invited him down to Mar-a-Lago, and the two leaders will travel there for the weekend.  This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance, and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan.
Needless to say, the President is looking very much forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House to celebrate their fifth World Championship.  It was obviously a spectacular game.
Lastly, we have our eyes on Kabul today following the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least 19 Afghan civilians and wounded 14 [41].  Just this morning, General Flynn spoke with the Afghan National Security Advisor to reaffirm our continued support for Afghanistan and for our Strategic Partnership.  We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms, and we commend the Afghan security forces for their rapid response.  We also reaffirm our support to the Afghan government as they work to defend their people against enemies of peace.
And with that, I’ll take your questions.  David Jackson.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-020717/

MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Happy Friday.  It’s another busy day here at the White House and across the Trump administration.
The first jobs report under the President’s administration was released this morning.  It’s National Wear Red Day, highlighting the importance of preventing heart disease.  It’s National Catholic Schools Week.  And the President is going to be signing some executive orders, delivering some much-needed regulatory relief to lenders and borrowers in the next few minutes.
We’re finishing up the second week here really strong.  Yesterday, another great deal was reached with Lockheed Martin for the purchase of a new lot of F35s.  Through the President’s intervention, a total of 90 planes — for a lot of 90 planes; 55 were purchased for U.S. military that added up to a total of $455 million savings for U.S. taxpayers from the previous lot, with an average cost reduction of 7.5 percent, another big win that the President has delivered on for U.S. taxpayers.
Speaking of good numbers, let’s turn to the jobs report.  The economy added more than 227,000 new jobs, significantly more than the 175,000 that had been expected.  Today’s report reflects the consumer confidence that the Trump presidency has inspired.  According to a recent Gallup poll, economic confidence is at a new high, and ADP showed strong private sector hiring.  President Trump campaigned on how to make America work again.  Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise.  The President has already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and he’s looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one.
While the President is definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that there’s a lot more work to be done.  The President has a big and bold agenda to grow the U.S. economy and to create jobs.  In just his first two weeks in office, he’s met with more than 50 business leaders across a vast range of industries.  This morning, the President participated in a strategic and policy forum with business leaders from some of our country’s most successful companies.  The President understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders on how to make the nation’s economy stronger.  His firsthand experience as a successful businessman helps to guide his decisions as President, and he will continue to seek opinions of other job creators while crafting an economic agenda.
All of these meetings are focused on one primary goal: providing new and improved employment opportunities for all Americans.  We’re looking at a full range of policy measures to achieve that goal: regulatory relief, tax and trade reform, empowering women in the workplace, rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, and improving our education system.
Also today, in pursuit of that goal, the President will be signing two executive actions as part of his plan to overhaul our financial and regulatory system.  I expect that to happen closer to the one o’clock hour.  The first is an executive order for posing guideline principles that sets the table for a regulatory system that mitigates risk, encourages growth, and more importantly, protects consumers.
The Dodd-Frank Act is a disastrous policy that’s hindering our markets, reducing the availability of credit, and crippling our economy’s ability to grow and create jobs.  It imposed hundreds of new regulations on financial institutions while establishing unaccountable and unconstitutional new agency that does not adequately protect consumers.  Perhaps worst of all, despite all of its overreaching, Dodd-Frank did not address the causes of the financial crisis, something we all know must be done.  It did not solve the “too big to fail,” and we must determine conclusively that the failure of a large bank will never again leave taxpayers on the hook.
The presidential memorandum addresses the burdens of government regulations and the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule.  The rule is a solution in search of a problem.  There are better ways to protect investors, and the Trump administration is taking action to do so.  We’re directing the Department of Labor to review this rule.  The rule’s intent may be to have provided retirees and others with better financial advice, but in reality, its effect has been to limit the financial services that are available to them.
President Trump does not intend to put unnecessary limits on economic opportunity.  The Department of Labor exceeded its authority with this rule, and this is exactly the kind of government regulatory overreach the President was put into office to stop.  We desperately need to overhaul how we approach financial regulation.  The President is taking action to protect American taxpayers and get people back to work.
Moving on, we announced earlier this week that we would be taking steps to address Iran’s recent actions.  Today, the U.S. sanctioned 25 individuals and entities that provide support to Iran’s ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Quds Force.  These designations are in response to Iran’s ongoing ballistic missile program, including its ballistic missile test on January 29, 2017, as well as Iran’s continued support for terrorism.  We’ve taken these actions today, after careful consideration, and will continue to respond with appropriate action.
These designations mark yet another stop in our continued effort to aggressively target Iran’s ballistic missile program and terrorism-related activities.  Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Mattis is on the final day of a two-day trip through Asia.  He visited Korea yesterday and Japan today, returning to Washington tomorrow.  Secretary Mattis’s visit emphasizes the priority President Trump places on the Asia-Pacific, and on strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance in the face of a growing North Korea nuclear and ballistic missile threat.
Over in the Senate, the President now has 11 Cabinet nominees awaiting a full Senate vote on their confirmations.  We look forward to welcoming these individuals into the administration.
Regarding the weekend’s plans, the President will debut his second weekly Facebook Live event this evening at 5 o’clock.  You can expect him to recap another week of action on behalf of the American people.  He’ll also comment on his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  And while recognizing Black History Month, he will discuss his vision to deliver more opportunity and safety for the African-American community.
One more note of this week’s address:  the lead-in to the President’s remark on Facebook Live will feature some of the incredible artwork throughout the White House that was created by African American artists, so you definitely don’t want to miss this.
As I mentioned previously, this weekend the President will be shifting the operation of the White House down to the “Winter White House” at Mar-a-Lago.  While in Florida, he’ll hold meetings and calls with advisors and staff to plan for another big week of action on behalf of the American people.  We’ll provide readouts of these as they occur.  By our count, as of this morning the administration has already racked up more than 60 significant actions:  21 executive actions, 16 meetings with foreign leaders, and 10 stakeholder meetings, to name a few.
We’re looking forward to another productive week next week.
On Monday, the President will visit Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base.
While at MacDill, the President will receive command briefings from both CENTCOM and SOCOM, have lunch with the enlisted troops, and have an all-hands address to personnel.  General Dunford and General Flynn will also be present for the meetings, and the President will return to Washington that evening.
With that, I’m going to go my first Skype question seat.   Jackie Nespral from NBC 6 in South Florida.  Jackie.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-020317/

6655,Trump,2017-02-02 07:32:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,Nan,"
MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Happy Groundhog Day.  We’ve got six more weeks of winter, apparently.  Luckily, for those of you who are going to be joining the President down to Florida this weekend, you’ll get some time to get a glimpse of summer at the “Winter White House” in Mar-a-Lago.
The President is going to start his meeting at 1:00 sharp.  You probably just saw the b-roll of folks from Harley rolling on in, literally.  So I’m going to try to keep this a little quick.
The President signed a proclamation yesterday ushering in Black History Month.  He looks forward to an engaging and informative month of events honoring the enormous contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history.
Last night, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of the next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in the Oval Office.  As the President said last night, Secretary Tillerson is a man who’s already respected all over the world for the tremendous life that he’s led, and now will bring his years of experience to the critical task of making our nation safer, more prosperous, and more secure.
It’s time to bring a clear-eyed focus to our foreign affairs, and now with Secretary Tillerson at the helm of the State Department, we’ll do just that.  We’ll strengthen our alliances, form new ones, and enhance America’s interests throughout the world.
Speaking of the President’s excellent nominees, praise is pouring in from around the country for his pick for Supreme Court.  The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch is a “legal superstar”; “an outstanding choice,” says the New Hampshire Union Leader.  The Richmond Times-Dispatch says the “initial reaction” was “to cheer.”  The South Florida Sun Sentinel touted his “excellent qualifications.”
Yesterday, Judge Gorsuch had his first round of meetings on the Hill.  Unfortunately, Senate offices aren’t in the habit of releasing editorials, but from everything we heard, the Judge knocked it out of the park on the Senate as well.  The President looks forward to a fair and speedy confirmation process for this exceedingly qualified nominee and jurist.
In my last briefing, I read out a list of the senators Judge Gorsuch met with.  In addition to the meeting with Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Judiciary Chairman Grassley, and Senators Hatch and Gardner, the Judge also met with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.  Recently, Senator Manchin expressed his belief that Judge Gorsuch could win enough Democrats to hit 60 votes.  I’ll agree with the Senator there on that one.  I mean, we have to have a few Trump-state Democrats who want to win re-election.
But, as I pointed out yesterday, this so-called 60 vote “standard” is simply not accurate.  Democrats are grasping at straws to block the confirmation of an unquestionably qualified nominee.  I’ll repeat, neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama put forward were subject to the 60-vote threshold.  So although I agree with Senator Manchin that Judge Gorsuch will probably get enough Democrats to get to 60, it’s just simply not ever been a requirement.
Now, on to the events of today.  The President started his day by attending the National Prayer Breakfast.  It’s a tradition that continued over six decades, going back to President Eisenhower.  The President thanked the American people for their faith and prayers that have sustained and inspired him, noting that the five words that he has heard more than any others as he’s traveled throughout the country are, “I’m praying for you.”
He spoke at length about the ISIS genocide against Christians and the oppression of peace-loving Muslims, as well as the threats of extermination against the Jewish people, and made it clear that he believes the United States has a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.
He encouraged Americans to remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  With that goal in mind, the President remarked that he’s taken action to ensure that the United States will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread throughout our nation.  In the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and reject any form of oppression or discrimination.
The President also committed to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and allowing our representatives of faith to speak freely and without retribution.
In a particularly poignant moment during his remarks, the President recalled yesterday his visit to Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief Ryan Owens as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  After honoring Chief Owens for giving his life in defense of the American people, the President quoted John 15:13:  “Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”
After returning to the White House this morning, the President held a legislative affairs staff meeting in the Oval Office with his team.  The team continues to work closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, extensive outreach is underway on Capitol Hill and we look forward to the Judge receiving a swift and fair hearing.
Between his meetings, the President was pleased to see that EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt was voted out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  As has unfortunately become the practice, Democrats again boycotted the hearing, requiring a suspension of the rules in order to advance his nomination.
Following the strategy session, the President met with Senators Hatch, Wyden and Congressmen Brady and Neal.  This meeting was an opportunity for the President to meet with the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee to help chart the future of U.S. trade policy.  The President has put together an all-star trade team that will work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative and the committees led by these members to craft new trade deals.
The President has expressed his concern time and again with NAFTA, which he believes is an out-of-date agreement.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the best and fairest treatment of U.S. workers and businesses, and the President believes that those interests are best secured by bilateral, rather than multilateral trade deals.  He looks forward to working closely with the USTR and Congress when it comes to issues of trade.
For those of you who weren’t outside and just saw the Harleys roll up, it’s no surprise that this afternoon the President will host a meeting and listening session with Harley-Davidson executives and union representatives.  For a list of those individuals, please contact our office.
Harley-Davidson has been an American success story since 1901, when William S. Harley, at age 21, completed the blueprint drawing of an engine designed to fit into a bicycle.  In 1903, Harley-Davidson began building motorcycles in the United States. And today, the company has approximately 6,000 employees and $6 billion in annual revenue.  The company’s global headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin — which may have had something to do with them getting in so quickly.  And there’s a certain staffer.
Today, the President will welcome to the White House the latest generation of Harley-Davidson executives to discuss how to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and factories in the United States.  Beyond the company executives, representatives from the machinists and steel workers unions were also be in attendance.
Their motorcycles have carried our American servicemembers in war.  They carry our police officers that keep us safe.  They carry the Secret Service as they protect our presidents.  And they bring joy to millions of Americans and throughout the world — and others throughout the world, rather.  The President is looking forward to hosting these leaders from one of America’s truly great entrepreneurial success stories.  The American worker built this country, and the President is focused on restoring a government that puts their interests first.
A few administrative notes.  The National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, today announced additions to the NSC senior staff.  David Cattler will be a Deputy Assistant to the President for Regional Affairs.  John Eisenberg, Deputy Assistant to the President, NSC Legal Advisor, and Department [Deputy] Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs.  Kevin Harrington, Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning.  And Kenneth Juster, Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs.
Lastly, we had a great reaction to our Skype introduction seats yesterday.  I know we’ve had a tremendous amount of requests pouring in from around the country.  Please contact the press office if you know of any that has an interest in joining us in the future.
In terms of the schedule for tomorrow, the President will host a Strategic and Policy Forum.  Then, in the afternoon, the President will have lunch with General Flynn before departing down to Mar-a-Lago later in the day.
With that, I’ll take some questions.

6658,Trump,2017-02-01 08:43:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,Nan,"
MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thanks for coming.
Last night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court.  It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia.  As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing.
In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles.
During his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators — including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy — were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006.
With as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate.
Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia.
Judge Gorsuch’s academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.
Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text.  He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the — he believes — sorry, I almost screwed that one up — (laughter) — he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings.  He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background.
And I would note, I think — and I always want to caveat this — but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the — as someone he clerked for on the bench.  So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate.
Now, on to the issues of the day.  Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month.  The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room.  The meeting also included some of the administration’s African American appointees.
Later today, the President will issue a proclamation.  The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 — excuse me, 1994 and 2004.  President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon.
At events throughout this entire month, we’ll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders — from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas.  African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that.
Continuing with today’s schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night.  On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell.  And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner.
With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it’s a good time to talk about the confirmation process.  Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster.  They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified.  And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment.
Also this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, including David O’Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center;
Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute.
President Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President.  He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law.
The attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign.  They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote.  The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor.
The President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson.  Mr. Tillerson’s tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination.
Later this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  So far, between the Vice President and staff, we’ve had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the President’s nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court.
Now, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination process.  Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where I’m going with that:  Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the President’s attempts to make America great again.
Just today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present.  Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt’s hearing.  They’re doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics.  The President’s Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote.
In other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today.  We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General.
Additionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — designee — is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon.  And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon.
A few more things before I open it up for questions.
In terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House.  The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady.  Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon.
A few personnel announcements.  Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate:  Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General.
On another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the President’s executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry.  I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject.  For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking.  A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent — which is a clear majority — of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat.
A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country.  And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President’s top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he’s taking to keep our country safe.
Further, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the President’s decision to take our national security so seriously.  The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the “structural problems” faced by these nations.
I know that there was a question on Monday regarding Iran’s firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel.  I’d like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update.
GENERAL FLYNN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran’s destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East.
The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.  These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.
In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms.  The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk.
President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.  Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.
Thank you.
MR. SPICER:  Thanks, General.  We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff — NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room.  Further details will be provided on that subject.  So thank you, General, with that.
As we start off, I mentioned yesterday I’m pleased that we’ve expanded the briefing room — at least virtually.  And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I’m pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island.

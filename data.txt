MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Hey, hey.  Well, Steve.  Hi.  That was so nice.  A little rally.  (Laughter.) Okay, so today, as you can see, we have Jen Klein in the room with us, in the briefing room — Director of the Gender Policy Council — here to discuss today’s event marking the 30th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act, as well as how the administration is fighting for women and their access to healthcare amid extreme attacks from Republican officials just access the country. So she has a — a hard t- — a hard time out.  Right?  You have to get — get out of here because she does have to meet with the President in the Oval Office in a few minutes, but she wanted to speak with all of you and take some questions.And, Jen, the podium is yours. MS. KLEIN:  Thanks.Q    Which is more terrifying? MS. KLEIN:  (Laughs.)  I’ll take that question. Good morning.  Later today, President Biden is hosting an event in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act.  He will be joined by Vice President Harris and several members of his Cabinet and will welcome President Bill Clinton back to the White House to celebrate the first bill that President Clinton signed in office. The Family and Medical Leave Act came about after years of work by advocates and members of Congress, including support by President Biden as a senator, and from a historic number of women trailblazers in Congress, some of whom will join the President at the White House today. This event is a moment to recognize the difference that the Family and Medical Leave Act has made and continues to make for millions of Americans.  But it’s also a moment to recognize the work that remains to be done to support workers, including the need to pass a national paid family and medical leave law.  The President will discuss recent actions the administration has taken to support women in the workplace, including through the year-end omnibus, which included the passage of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, as well as significant investments in childcare.

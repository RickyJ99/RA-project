James S. Brady Press Briefing Room124 P.M. EDT     MS. MCENANY  Hello, everyone.  Where is Nancy Pelosi?  The House is in recess.  House and Senate Democrats left town after failing to compromise and make a deal to provide relief to the American people.  While Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues went home, this President remained hard at work.  President Trump took executive action, including stopping evictions providing unemployment insurance pausing student loan payments cutting the payroll tax, which put money in the pockets of all Americans.      Democrats apparently were unable to stick around to make a deal.  Now, suddenly, Democrats will be rushing back to Washington.  But why?  The answer the United States Postal Service.  Its a stunning turn of events.  Democrats went home after accomplishing nothing no deal on stimulus checks, no deal on smallbusiness relief, no deal on eviction protections.  The concerns of everyday Americans were not the concerns of Democrats on Capitol Hill.      So where is Nancy Pelosi?  She and her Democrat colleagues will be back in Washington soon to pursue their latest manufactured crisis the Postal Service.  Democrats denied a 10 billion offer for the U.S. Postal Service by this President before they went on recess.  But now theyre back to pursue the latest Democratmanufactured crisis.  Its sad, but its clear where Democrats priorities stand.      And with that, Ill take questions.      John.

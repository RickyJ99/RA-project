James S. Brady Press Briefing Room211 P.M. EDTMS. MCENANY Hello, everyone. I hope you all had an enjoyable weekend. I have some brief announcements for you today  just that now we have 760 sites and retail locations in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia. CVS is planning to open an additional 650 sites. These are encouraging numbers. Its, again, a testament to our private sector for all that theyve done in partnering with the administration and helping to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Also skilled nursing facilities  there was an announcement that I just want to underscore that 4.9 billion in additional relief funds were distributed to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities, and these funds are provided under the CARES Act.So just those two items for you this morning, and well go ahead and well start with questions.John.

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room103 P.M. EDTMS. MCENANY Good afternoon, everyone. The President shows up. When the Trump administration arrives in a Democratrun city engulfed in chaos, peace is restored, law and order is upheld.Washington D.C., New York, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Kenosha all of these cities are Democratrun all of these cities have experienced anarchy, violence, and destruction in recent days  the opposite of a peaceful protest.This is the reality facing American cities and towns across the country. This is not hypothetical. These are real people and real lives that have been impacted.Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, rejected federal law enforcement in an irrational and tonedeaf letter. Mayor Wheeler might have thought he put political points on the board, but the very next day, a protester was shot and killed on the streets of his city.Before the Trump administration took action in Kenosha, businesses were burned, property damaged, and chaos was rampant. Then, nearly 1,000 National Guard troops and 200 DOJ personnel were deployed at the request of local officials. President Trump showed up, and law and order arrived.Nationally, according to the DOJ, 300 have been arrested and 302 charged amid riots and unrest. Democrats are late to the game. Ive stood behind this podium and highlighted this issue for months. While this President is always willing to show up, it is incumbent on Democrats to step up Invite federal law enforcement in we stand ready. Do not tolerate anarchy, violence, and destruction. Rioting is not right. Secure your streets.President Trump will visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, tomorrow. This president will show up. He will go to cities where Americans are hurting.And with that, Ill take questions.Kaitlan.

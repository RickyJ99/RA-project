James S. Brady Press Briefing Room217 P.M. EDTMS. MCENANY Good afternoon, everyone. The President has made clear that what we are seeing on Americas streets is unacceptable. Violence, looting, anarchy, lawlessness are not to be tolerated, plain and simple. These criminal acts are not protest. They are not statements. These are crimes that harm innocent American citizens.The First Amendment guarantees the right of the people to peaceably assemble. What we saw last night in Washington and across the country was not that.To that end, President Trump is demanding action to protect American citizens, to protect American businesses. Seventeen thousand National Guard are deployed in 24 states, but according to General Milley, only two states have deployed more than 1,000. There are 350,000 National Guard available overall, and for the lawlessness we are seeing, far more needs to be done.Governors across the country must act, deploy the National Guard as its fit, and protect American communities. As President Trump has said repeatedly, its very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights of peaceful protesters, but we cannot allow a situation like what happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well.And with that, Ill take questions.

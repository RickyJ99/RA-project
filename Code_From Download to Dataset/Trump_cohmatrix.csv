456,Trump,2020-08-31 12:45:00+00:00,"Remarks by President Trump in Press Briefing | August 31, 2020",Nan,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
5:45 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I’d like to begin by saying we’ve just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market — Dow — in 36 years. That’s very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401(k)s and with the stocks that they have. And that’s a tremendous achievement: best in 36 years.
Let me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38 percent. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid, point-of-care tests. These tests return results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We’re being focusing — we’re focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high-risk populations. So we’re going to have the 15-minute, and less, tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point-of-care tests. That’s something.
This evening, I am pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials. So that’s joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and, hopefully, approval. In the United States, we’re doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months.
Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time.
I also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we’re seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, federal law enforcement is working with state and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists, and bring them to justice. We’ve just come up with a report that we’ve arrested a large number of people. It’s over 200. And you’ll be hearing about that, but they’ve been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We’re doing it very low key, but we’re trying to help cities. They are, in all cases, Democrat-run, but we’re doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent.
We’d like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately one hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don’t know why it’s good for him to have a city that’s falling apart and that’s under siege now for 94 days. But, really, it’s been under siege for years, if you know Portland.
So, to the mayor, I say: Whenever you’re ready, let us know. We’ll solve your problem of violence. We’ll solve your problem of crime. We’ll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you’ll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland.
The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the federal government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters, just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we’ve seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Biden — Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats; it’s Democrat-run cities, and it’s a shame, and it can be solved so easy. It can be solved very easily.
The violence is fueled by dangerous rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they’re very good at doing. We’ve taken that power away. They’re afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They’re afraid to be destroyed.
You saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republic — the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife Kelly. What they went through, but other people went through it too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is the public is very wise to it. They see what’s happening, and they’re wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly.
Left-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about, the — really, you hear this from people — what they’re saying, how they’re saying it — the violence, it’s terrible. And again, it’s Democrat politicians. I don’t know that they’re spurring it on or they’re afraid to stop it. But in any event, we’re there to help. We’re there to get things under control.
What they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And, frankly, the mayor — Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser — should have done a better job. She did a very poor job. But at the same time, we had the police, who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess, it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down but got right up, and two others joined them, and they were able to get Rand and Kelly through.
But it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar — not to the extent, in terms of taping. We don’t have to the tapes as strong, but some people went through — from what I heard — as bad, or worse.
The violent rioters share Biden’s same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, he didn’t mention the fact, and he didn’t mention the far left. He didn’t mention the far left, or, from what I saw, I don’t believe he mentioned the word “Antifa.” Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn’t mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement.
He went on point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn’t talk about those on the left. And those on the left are the problem, and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side: They’re both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious.
And until that neutralizes, you’re never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas. For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals repeating the monstrous lie that these were peaceful protests. They’re not peaceful protests. That’s anarchy. That’s — you look at the agitators, you look at the looters, you look at the rioters — that’s not a peaceful protest.
They keep using the term — it’s so nice — “peaceful protest.” And behind the reporter, the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I’ll be going tomorrow. And at least the governor asked me if I could, we would — I said, “You got to get the National Guard.” And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things, and that was about five days ago, six days ago. And ever since, it’s been very good.
Thirteen members of Biden’s campaign staff donated to bail and — rioters — they’re getting them out of jail. Looters — they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It’s outrageous that they’re now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem.
And they really want to put it on the — on the backs of the police. I see it. The police are — there’s just a war on law enforcement in this country. And without law enforcement, we wouldn’t have a country. We have very talented people; they’re not allowed to do their job.
If you give the radical-left power, what you’re seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they’ve had such problems.
To defeat them, we must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting. And that’s what we want to do.
They want to destroy our country. They’re going to destroy our suburbs. But I think I’ve gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration; they were going to be made much worse.
What we’re witnessing today is a result of left-wing indoctrination in our nation’s schools and universities. Many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism.
Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn’t even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren’t mentioned.
Two words that were taken out were the words “under God” — “under God” — two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance. In their caucus, I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said “That’s strange. What’s — that’s a big…” I tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn’t make a mistake. Then they did it later on.
So they took the word — essentially, took the word “God” out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We’re not taking the word “God” out of anything. We’re not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we’re not taking the great word “God” out of anything.
At our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left’s war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it’s good, but it’s gotten out of control. They’re unable to control this radical-left, crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly — very, very, quickly indeed.
The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our nation’s schools, where they’re trying to change everything that we’ve learned. What we’ve learned — in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason — cancel culture — whatever you want to call it.
At the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance — zero — for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the U.S. population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated.
Biden won’t even say the name “Antifa.” I don’t believe he said it today. He made a speech, and he didn’t mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn’t mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement, he mentioned the police, and — but he didn’t mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there’s no way that he’ll solve the problem. You don’t name it, you don’t solve it.
In fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants: the far-left policy agenda it’s asking for. And if that happened, we don’t have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn’t go away; they gain new power to spread the terror nationwide.
Most of our nation is extremely safe, by the way. You know, you only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago, and you see what’s happened in New York just in a very short period of time. It’s horrible what’s happened in New York. I love New York; I come from New York. And when I see — four years ago, I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He’s terrible mayor; one of the worst. I can’t say “the worst.” I mean, I — I’ve witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he’s certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what’s happening in New York, and I look at what’s happening in the city, and — so quickly. It happened so quickly. It’s a shame.
Biden’s strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he’s doing — I don’t think he even knows what he’s doing — and give them control over every lever of power in the United States government. But when you surrender to the mob, you don’t get freedom; you get fascism. That’s what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what — look what’s going on there and other places.
Biden is using — Biden is using mafia talking points: “The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want.” That’s what it is. “The mob will leave you alone. Give them what you want.” But it doesn’t work that way, because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking.
What happens is you give and give and give, and you take, and they no longer respect you. And that’s what’s happened with the Democrats, because I actually think they’ve lost control of these radical-left maniacs. I think they’ve lost control, because I don’t think they feel that’s helping them — when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland, and you look at Baltimore, and you look at so many different places and what’s going on there. The top 10 are all run by Democrats, and you can go a lot further down the list than 10.
In America, we will never surrender to mob rule because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we’re continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don’t even think about it. They wake up the next morning; they don’t even think about it.
This is the extreme left’s agenda for America: They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers.
No one will be safe. And, in fact, they want very much to let people in prison — like, as an example, the Boston bomber — they want to let everybody vote. If you’re in prison, if you’re the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don’t know, I don’t think that sells too well.
My administration is a very different approach. We want states to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard. We’re prepared. We’re ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country — East Coast, West Coast, doesn’t matter — we’re ready to move immediately, as we did in Minneapolis, as we did — we are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine.
Tomorrow, I’m going to a place where we moved very quickly — you know that — in Wisconsin. And we moved very, very quickly. And as soon as we moved, that was the end of that. It was very well behaved.
I’ll appoint more tough-on-crime prosecutors, support stiffer penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows. And we need order. We need — we need order. You can’t have cities run like these cities are run.
They gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more. And all of a sudden, they’ve lost these cities, but I’ll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, “Please come in.” As you know, they have to ask — unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don’t like to do that — they have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we’ll be there within a matter of minutes.
When I signed the executive order outlining 10-year prison sentences, as an example, for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was three months ago or so. I signed an order, and it said, “Ten years in prison.” Ten years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge, I haven’t seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They cancelled that march. They said 10 years is too long.
Before the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime. In the last two years of the Obama administration, murder increased 30 percent in major American cities, and we witnessed the largest two-year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century.
In the first two years of my presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation LeGend, surging federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. And we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot.
Since the beginning of Operation LeGend, we have conducted more than 1,000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third; got it down 33 percent. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don’t know that, but we sent them into Chicago without fanfare at all. But we cut it down in half; it’s still far too high. And if they’d ask for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we’d be able to cut it down to a very low number.
While I am President, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe. And we do — we honor our police; we honor our law enforcement.
I have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most — most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of — the sheriffs in Florida — all of them; law enforcement in Ohio; in Texas; North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I’ve gotten all of it. We’ll have to do a little study so I’m totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn’t, I think we have to look at them — where do they come from.
So we — we’ve done a real job. We’re ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don’t even have to put it in writing. We’ll put it in writing later. We’ll get them in there, and we’ll straighten out the city very quickly — whichever city we may be talking about.
So those governors that are responsible for a state that has a city that’s got a lot of problems: Call me or the mayor can call me, and we’ll be there very quickly.
Tomorrow, we’re making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we’re proud of it because, in six days, it’s been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately.
Okay, please. Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-8-31-2020/

1:03 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: Good afternoon, everyone. The President shows up. When the Trump administration arrives in a Democrat-run city engulfed in chaos, peace is restored, law and order is upheld.
Washington D.C., New York, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Kenosha: all of these cities are Democrat-run; all of these cities have experienced anarchy, violence, and destruction in recent days — the opposite of a peaceful protest.
This is the reality facing American cities and towns across the country. This is not hypothetical. These are real people and real lives that have been impacted.
Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, rejected federal law enforcement in an irrational and tone-deaf letter. Mayor Wheeler might have thought he put political points on the board, but the very next day, a protester was shot and killed on the streets of his city.
Before the Trump administration took action in Kenosha, businesses were burned, property damaged, and chaos was rampant. Then, nearly 1,000 National Guard troops and 200 DOJ personnel were deployed at the request of local officials. President Trump showed up, and law and order arrived.
Nationally, according to the DOJ, 300 have been arrested and 302 charged amid riots and unrest. Democrats are late to the game. I’ve stood behind this podium and highlighted this issue for months. While this President is always willing to show up, it is incumbent on Democrats to step up: Invite federal law enforcement in; we stand ready. Do not tolerate anarchy, violence, and destruction. Rioting is not right. Secure your streets.
President Trump will visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, tomorrow. This president will show up. He will go to cities where Americans are hurting.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

5:32 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And it’s good to see you all.  Hope you had a great weekend at your convention.  And we’re going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.
But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I’d like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
Yesterday, I approved a major disaster declaration for California.  I spoke to Governor Newsom as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their state.  That continues.  The federal government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires.  We’re working very closely with the governor and very closely with a lot of great state representatives and local representatives, and we’ll take care of the situation.  But we have 26,000 first responders already.
Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes.  As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire — one of the biggest we’ve ever seen — my administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly.  Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana two days later.  This is somewhat unprecedented — the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another.
Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico.  We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous — tremendous people.
We have — FEMA is lined up.  We have the Coast Guard ready.  The Coast Guard has — has done a fantastic job.  They do so many — they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.
I’m asking all Americans in the storm’s path to follow the instructions of your state and local governments very closely.  And I’ve approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana.  FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help.  They will be in there very quickly — very, very quickly.
And I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I’ve informed him.  And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go.  We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California.  So we have a great team.  Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.
On the therapeutics front, this is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time.  This is a great thing.  Today, I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.  The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization — and that’s such a powerful term: emergency use authorization — for a treatment known as convalescent plasma.  This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection.  It’s had an incredible rate of success.
Today’s action will dramatically expand access to this treatment.  And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar.  I want to thank the FDA — all of the people that have been working very hard on this.  It showed tremendous potential.
This is the only possible — and it’s only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed that has everybody working together.  We’re years ahead of approvals.  We would be — if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we’d be two years, three years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you’ll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.
To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we’re removing unnecessary barriers and delays not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government.
We’ve provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus.  Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent.  It’s a tremendous number.
The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease.
Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.  Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.
In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have — who have recovered — and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they’ve donated — but these are people recovering from the virus — to donate plasma.  Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled.
And today, I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today please.  It’s been really an incredible — just incredible people.  The country has united so strongly behind this.
And I’ll go over the numbers, but if you look at what’s happened and the success that we’ve had that people don’t talk about — the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world.  You don’t hear that.
The European Union’s case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States.  Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.
And I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words.  And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up — and especially over the last few days — in getting this done.  The results have been incredible, and I think you’ll see the results even go up very substantially.  So we appreciate it.
And maybe I’ll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen.  Thank you very much, Alex.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today.
Thanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19.  And thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world.
In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment.
President Trump is the Right to Try President, and he’s fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments.  Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use, and this FDA authorization is one result of that effort.
The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course — within three days of being diagnosed — with plasma containing high levels of antibodies benefited the most from treatment.  We saw about a 35 percent better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment — which were patients under 80 who were not on artificial respiration.
I just want to emphasize this point because I don’t want you to gloss over this — this number.  We dream, in drug development, of something like a 35 percent mortality reduction.  This is a major advance in the treatment of patients.  This is a major advance.
Convalescent plasma is one new tool that we’ve added to our arsenal against COVID-19, alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied.  Because of the President’s Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall.
Operation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing so that if they meet FDA’s gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.
Americans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to Coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight.  Know: If you donate plasma, you could save a life.
We’ve also provided guidance so healthcare providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.
So, thank you again, Mr. President, for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19.  And I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they’ve approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA.
And I’ll turn it over to Dr. Hahn if that’s okay, Mr.  President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thank you very much.
Please, Doctor.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  It’s good to be here today to announce FDA’s recent decision.  From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers.  And I just want to echo the President’s thanks to the more than 17,000 men and women who work at FDA.  They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.
So, plasma is the liquid portion of the blood.  That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection — in this case, COVID-19 — and that liquid portion can be extracted.  And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, it’s been given to patients with infectious diseases — for more than 100 years.  So there was a really good rationale for why this might work.
And, in fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded-access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the federal government, under President Trump’s leadership, and that has gone on for the last four months.  More than 90,000, close to 100,000 Americans have enrolled in this program and over 70,000 have received treatment.  This is one of the largest expanded-access programs in the history of FDA.  So, a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.
So, in the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data — not just the data from this expanded-access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this.  Those — those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization.
In the optimal treatment — the optimal patients, as described by Secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35 percent improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.
Now, we’re waiting for more data.  We’re going to continue to gather data.  But this clearly meets the criteria that we’ve established for emergency use authorization, and we’re very pleased with these results.
So, let me just put this in perspective.  Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35 percent improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit.  What that means is — and if the data continue to pan out — 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.
We’ve seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country.  And what this EUA does — EUA — emergency use authorization today does: It allows us to continue that and meet the demand.
And again, I want to echo the President’s and the Secretary’s ask of the American people: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, please donate.  It could save a life.
And, Mr. President, thank you again.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Stephen.  I appreciate it.
Okay, any questions, please?  Please, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-23-2020/

5:54 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I’d like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.
Today, I’m directing the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to notify the U.N. Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran.  It’s a snapback; it’s not uncommon.
Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which was a product of the Obama-Biden foreign policy failure — a failure like few people have seen, in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short-term deal.  This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to Iran — $150 billion, to be exact — plus $1.8 billion in cash, which I don’t know that the President have the authority to give.  He gave $1.8 billion in cash.  Just another great deal.  That turned out to be a total disaster.  It would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.
And I won’t say anything, because I don’t like saying it, but Iran doesn’t have so much money to give to the world anymore — to the terrorists, to give to al Qaeda and various other groups of people that they were funding.  They have to keep their own regime together, and it’s not easy for them.
And if and when I win the election, within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly.
But that deal was a disaster: 150 billion dollars; 1.8 billion dollars in cash.  And we got nothing, except a short-term, little deal.  A short-term, expiring.  It’s starting to expire already.  It’s terminated, but it would have, if we didn’t terminate it, start to expire very shortly.
A good deal was the deal we made with UAE and Israel.  And, by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal.  Countries that you wouldn’t even believe want to come into that deal.  And, all of a sudden, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East, and you couldn’t have done it with this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with Sleepy Joe Biden.
I imposed the toughest-ever sanctions on Iran, and this has caused great difficulty for them giving money to terrorist organizations.  And if they do, they’ll have hell to pay.
Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, in addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the two leading terrorists by far in the world.  The founder of ISIS.  Nobody even talks about that.  And we also defeated — we now have 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria.  When I took over, it was a mess.  It was a total mess.  It was — they were all over the place.
My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on.  They will never have a nuclear weapon.  Iran will never have — mark it down.  Mark it down: Iran will never have a nuclear weapon.  When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the U.N. sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy — a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.
Here at home, through Operation LeGend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat-run American cities.  It’s absolutely shocking.  When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles — Democrat-run cities — they’re a mess because they don’t get it.  Either they don’t get it or there’s something that nobody else understands.
We’ve deployed more than 1,000 additional federal agents to help these Democrat-run disasters.  We just have done this.  We have to give them a hand.  And we can stop it immediately, like a Portland would be so easy to stop.  We’d stop it immediately.
We only sent in some Homeland people — who are great, by the way — to save the courthouse, because it would have been blown up or burned down, and they did that very easily.  But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it’s Homeland, whether it’s FBI, whether it’s just law enforcement — and we’d send them in quickly.  We would eradicate it, just like happened in Minneapolis.  As soon as they were called in — they should have been called in a lot sooner; you would’ve had far less damage.
Today, we announced that Operation LeGend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already.  Bad ones.  Bad ones.  Really bad people.  Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow.  And they’ll be a very long time in prison for what they’ve done to these cities.  Most cities are well run; most of the nation is well run.  And the areas that we’re talking about are all — in all cases, run by Democrats, usually radi- — radical-left-leaning Democrats, like in New York or in Portland.
We’ve made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Memphis, and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson, and 91 murders.
We’re also using the full power of the federal government to defeat, as you know, the China virus.  New cases have declined in 80 percent of the jurisdictions in the past week.  Eighty percent.  New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak.  And other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look — because we’ve done an incredible job — but they’re having a lot of outbreaks, but they’ll be able to put them out and we put them out.
The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country 54 percent since its peak in April.  Fifty-four percent.  Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus: 92 percent of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older.  Only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred among those 44 years — think of that — 44 years and younger.  So 44 years old and younger: only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred.  And many of those people had preexisting conditions, they had problems — heart, diabetes, and other problems, but — many of those.  So, think of that: only 2.7 percent under 44 years of age.
Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33 percent higher than the United States — evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations.  South Korea — you’ve been reading about South Korea doing well.  Well, they just had a very big breakout, but they’ll be able to solve the problem.
We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk, as we know.  Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching.  We have learned one thing: There’s nothing like campus, there’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board.  It’s been proven a lot better.  It’s a lot better.  The iPads are wonderful, but you’re not going to learn the same way you do by being there.  So, nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching.
For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal few [sic] — a seasonal flu.  And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don’t talk about it in the same way, and they shouldn’t.  But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to.
Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives.  It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans.  Makes sense.
And the shutdown thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down.  You look at certain areas that — in all cases, Democrat-run — still shut down, and the numbers there aren’t even good.  But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse.  A lot of problems are being caused — probably far more, I would say, Scott, than is caused by the virus itself, now that we understand the virus.
Colleges should take reasonable precautions.  Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness.  And universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors and teachers.
The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high-risk settings — and to prevent transmission, period — but especially in nursing homes; and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.
We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country.  We have a tremendous unused testing capacity.  It’s something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us.
In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science-based approach to protecting the high risk while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work and school.  Our country will be open.  Our country is getting open quickly.  Our stock markets are almost back to where they were, prior to the China virus disaster coming in.
And I want to thank you all for being here, and we’ll take some questions.
Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-19-2020/

     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Where is Nancy Pelosi?  The House is in recess.  House and Senate Democrats left town after failing to compromise and make a deal to provide relief to the American people.  While Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues went home, this President remained hard at work.  President Trump took executive action, including stopping evictions; providing unemployment insurance; pausing student loan payments; cutting the payroll tax, which put money in the pockets of all Americans. 
     Democrats apparently were unable to stick around to make a deal.  Now, suddenly, Democrats will be rushing back to Washington.  But why?  The answer: the United States Postal Service.  It’s a stunning turn of events.  Democrats went home after accomplishing nothing: no deal on stimulus checks, no deal on small-business relief, no deal on eviction protections.  The concerns of everyday Americans were not the concerns of Democrats on Capitol Hill. 
     So where is Nancy Pelosi?  She and her Democrat colleagues will be back in Washington soon to pursue their latest manufactured crisis: the Postal Service.  Democrats denied a $10 billion offer for the U.S. Postal Service by this President before they went on recess.  But now they’re back to pursue the latest Democrat-manufactured crisis.  It’s sad, but it’s clear where Democrats’ priorities stand. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.

5:26 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  And thank you for being here.  Let me provide a brief update on the China virus, as well as our economic recovery, which is going really very well, as you probably have been hearing.
     Nearly 85 percent of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases, and that’s despite the fact that we have the number one testing program anywhere in the world.  We’re up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country.  This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6 percent; the test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5 percent, a 71 percent reduction from April and a 15 percent reduction from mid-July.  That’s a big reduction.  The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April.
     And I urge everyone to apply commonsense mitigation.  We know that.  And we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for really doing such a great job. 
     The United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined.  If you combine all of Europe, it’s less than what we do.  Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes.  Nearly 80 percent of all commercial lab test results are now returned within three days.  So we’ve gotten that number down from about eight days to three days, and that’s only in the longer-term lab cases.  But we have many 15- minute tests; we have some 5-minute tests.  The turnaround time for federal surge testing sites is just two days.  So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can’t do anything about, it’s all the way down to two days.  That’s a very substantial reduction.  Great job by the people that do it.
     We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals.  Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for nearly half of all fatalities.  That’s an incredible thing.  So it’s 1 percent of the U.S. population but they account for nearly half of the fatalities from the China virus.  That’s why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment.  And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.
     In the coming days, we’ve worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the governors — 50 governors all around the United States — and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the governors.  And I think, for the most part, they’re doing a really good job.  They’re focused very heavily on nursing homes.  And when they need equipment that they can’t get — remember, they’re supposed to get it, but when they can’t get, we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock.
     Thanks to my administration’s decisive action to save American jobs, we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history.  And that’s because the foundation that we set previously, before the virus came and hit our shore — the foundation was so strong; we had such a strong foundation that we’re recovering much faster than anybody anticipated.  It turns out that it will be a very, very strong “V,” and you’ll see that in just a second.
     So retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all-time high.  That’s not all time for this month or last month; that’s at an all-time high, and you see that with the chart.  This was previous to the — the plague, I call it — the plague coming into our land, and really affected 188 — dealing with 188 countries. 
     And if you see, we’ve not only recovered but we’re at a much higher level than we were even then.  That’s an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible.  So we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history.  That’s an amazing statement. 
     So retail spending is great, and now, if they would put up, auto production has surged 28 percent, and that’s your auto production, which is right there.  (A chart is displayed.)  So you’ll see that that’s now about even to where it was, and that was at an all-time record high, and we’re already even. 
     And if you had a chart for used cars, you’d see that used car sales are setting a record, and that’s great for production because when the used cars are practically not available — they’re very, very tight — that means you’re going to make a lot of new cars.  So that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now, but that’s a fantastic number.  That’s a number that’s the equivalent of where it was, and that was a record.
     So you see what’s happening with respect to the economy and the recovery.  And the stock market is almost at an all-time high.  In fact, NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-15-2020/

1:34 P.M. EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much, everybody.  So we have some very interesting news.  Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey’s very corrupt FBI, is expected to plead guilty.  You probably heard that.  It just came out.  So that’s just the beginning, I would imagine, because what happened should never happen again.  So, he is pleading guilty.  Terrible thing.  Terrible thing.  The fact is they spied on my campaign and they got caught.  And you’ll be hearing more. 
    Today, the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a new report on how my administration has harnessed the full power of the Defense Production Act to achieve the greatest industrial mobilization since World War Two, in our fight against the China virus. 
    New factories, businesses, and laboratories are being built all over America to match our nation’s demand for personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, drugs, testing supplies, therapeutics, and vaccines.  It’s been incredible what we’ve been able to do in a very short period of time.  We’re helping other countries also because we’ve been really — we’ve been doing it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. 
    It was just announced, a little while ago, industrial production rose for the third straight month.  It’s a big thing.  Factory output was up 3.4 percent this month after a 5.7 increase last month.  Those are getting to be record numbers.  And manufacturing capacity utilization is now up to almost 70 percent.  So we’re coming back very strong.  We should have a very good third quarter.  We should have an unbelievably good next year.  Next year, if we don’t mess it up with somebody that has no idea what they’re doing, could be a fantastic year.
    My administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act to a number — and related authorities — at a — 78 times, dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials.  So, put it a little bit differently: The administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act and related authorities 78 times.  That’s a lot, Peter, right?  It’s a big number: 78 times.  It came in very handy.  A lot of times we just mentioned it and they did what we asked them to do.  Dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials. 
    I’ve used the DPA more comprehensively than any President in history.  There was a time when the media would say, “Why aren’t you using it?  Why aren’t you using it?”  Well, we have used it a lot, where necessary.  Only where necessary.  For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation. 
    By invoking the DPA, we mobilized the extraordinary productive might of General Motors to manufacture ventilators.  GM repurposed the Kokomo, Indiana, plant in just 17 days — an all-time record — and has now produced over 21,000 ventilators. 
    We’re also working with Ford Motor Company and General Electric to produce over 30,000 ventilators a month in Michigan.  They’ve done a great job.  Our nation is now the king of ventilators.  I say that: the king of ventilators.  We’re sending them all over the world and helping a lot of countries that could never have ventilators.  And it’s — really, I guess we’re looking to produce over 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year.  Those are some numbers.  So we’re helping a lot of countries. 
    In April, I directed 3M to increase its manufacturing of N95 masks.  By May, they had increased production by over a million masks a day.  Think of that: They increased production of masks by over one million a day.  3M is now manufacturing an additional 39 million masks a month.  We also worked with Honeywell to open factories in Arizona and Rhode Island.  They’re now producing over 20 million masks a month. 
    By the end of the year, domestic U.S. manufacturing will have produced over 1 billion N95 respirators, and all of them are made right here in the USA.  That’s a big difference from the past.
    Overall, we’ve increased N95 mask production by 400 million masks a year.  Now, the media might say, “Why not 500?  Why not 600?”  Nobody has seen numbers like this ever.
    We delivered more than $75 million in support to Puritan Medical in Maine.  I was up there.  I was — as you remember, we had a tremendous visit and tremendous throngs of people along the roads on the way to Puritan Medical.  Puritan has a doubled their production of testing swabs from 20 million to 40 million per month.  They’re doing a fantastic job, and so is Maine.
    I’ve also used the DPA to fight price gouging and hoarding.  My administration located and seized over half a million pieces of hoarded personal protective equipment, including 299,000 pairs of medical-grade gloves, 192,000 N95 respirators, and 130,000 surgical masks.  That’s hoarding.
    My administration’s decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results.  People have done an incredible job.  We’ve replenished the Strategic National Stockpile that was very badly depleted when we took office and totally neglected in the last administration.
    Since the start of the pandemic, we have tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to over 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to over 15 million, and quadrupled the number of ventilators to 69,000.
    By September, the Strategic National Stockpile inventory is on track to contain over 300,000 — excuse me, 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks, over 4.5 billion gloves, and over 190,000 ventilators.  That’s far more than we’ve done before.  It’s not even close. 
    As we talk about the economy, we continue to restore America’s industrial might.  We’re bringing jobs to the USA.  We understand that the economic health is critical — very critical to public health.  We’ll be discussing next week some of the outstanding numbers we have, compared to any other country.  There is no country even close when you look at what we’ve done compared to them on the stand- — from the standpoint of the economy and also during — even during the period of the China virus.
    In the last three months, we’ve added an average of 100,000 jobs every single day.  We’ve also added over 620,000 manufacturing jobs in the past three months.  That’s despite people saying, “You can’t do manufacturing jobs anymore.”  You’d “need a magic wand,” they said, but they were wrong.  Weekly jobless claims just fell below 1 million for the first time in a long time. 
    I’m pleased to announce that as part of Operation Warp Speed, the federal government will be partnering with McKesson Corporation — great company, which is a major medical supplier — to rapidly distribute a China-virus vaccine as soon as one is approved — fully approved.  They’re in stage three trials.  We have many of them going along different passes.  Also many different companies doing them — very, very incredible companies.
    We currently have three candidates in phase three clinical trials and are on pace to have more than 100 million doses of a vaccine ready before the end of the year and 500 million doses very shortly thereafter.  And we’re ready, logistically, to distribute them.  Our military is ready.  We have a great general who’s in charge.  That’s what he does, is he distributes things — usually it’s people and weapons, tanks — but in this case, it’s a vaccine or a therapeutic, as it may be.
    We continue to actively monitor the virus, executing our strategy to protect the vulnerable and prevent hospital overcrowding.  As of today, hospitalizations continue to be very stable, and we will be watching always very carefully.  Remain vigilant.
    We ask every citizen to practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask when distancing is not possible, and to protect the elderly.  Always protect the elderly.
    So now we’ll take a few questions if you’d like.
    John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-14-2020/

5:27 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everyone.  Thank you very much.  It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they’ve caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro — horribly shot — a young man, wonderful young man.  And we have just — this just came out two minutes ago.  So, Attorney General Barr just announced.
As you know, we named Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, where we’re going to be helping out, and are in the process of helping out, cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime — in particular, certain types of crime.  So that’s really good news.  They caught the killer of LeGend.
Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people.  That’s what it is.  At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.
Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans.  You know that.  He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early.
If he had followed — if we went after — I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died.  This is according to many people.  I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that.  He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.
Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every U.S. community based on his policies.  He wants to have ridiculous open borders.  I’ve been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that if you have open borders, you don’t have a country.  You don’t have a country, with open borders.  So he wants open borders.  The Democrats want open borders.
And if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through.  The wall is getting close to 290 miles long, and it’s having a huge impact.  So we disagree with him on that.  That’s one of the many different — many things that we disagree with.
But while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens.
He wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months — I guess this just happened; he thinks it’s good politics, I guess — no matter where they live and no matter their surroundings.  Because different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem.
He does not identify what authority the President has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed.
Also, many of our 50 states are doing the job at a level that frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice.  So I want to just say our governors have worked very hard.  They’ve worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that’s been going.
We have Scott now involved.  And so, Scott, congratulations.  You’ll be working with a lot of governors; you’ve already started.  And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.
If the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have?  That’s why he refused — Biden — to take questions.  He couldn’t answer any of them.  Couldn’t answer the questions.  He refuses to take questions.  He never takes questions.  I take questions; he never takes questions.  And you sort of wonder what’s going on, because they’re not that difficult.  Some can be nasty, but they’re not that difficult.  But he never takes questions.  So he just, I guess, left.  I didn’t see it, but I guess he just left the podium.  Put it in your minds.
My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks.  And I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do.  Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good.  Maybe they’re not so good.  But frankly, what do you have to lose?  You have nothing to lose.  So we do, and we’ve been saying wear them when it’s appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing, if you can’t distance enough.  And what do you have to lose?
But again, it’s up to the governors.  And we want to have a certain freedom.  We want to have a certain freedom.  That’s what we’re about.
At the same time, we also understand that each state is different and is facing unique circumstances.  You have very, very different states facing very unique differences and circumstances.
We’ve entrusted the governors of each state, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies, following guidance from the federal government and CDC.  We’re working with each state to implement a plan based on the facts and science.  We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the federal government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal.
Americans must have their freedoms.  And I trust the American people and their governors very much.  I trust the American people.  And the governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions, and Joe doesn’t.  Joe doesn’t.  Joe doesn’t know too much.
Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science.  That’s why we’re focused on protecting the high-risk Americans.  That is why we’re delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate.  And that is why we’re developing a vaccine and therapeutics in record time.  You’ll see that, I think, very soon.
Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to.  I think I can speak for you.  We’ve been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks.  But he wants them in the basement for months on end.
And you have governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their — wherever they may be — apartments.  And frankly, I don’t think the results are necessarily better than other results.  But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools, and grind society to a halt.  And he wants it done by a federal decree.  This would lead to a crippling long — long-lasting depression.  This would be a crippling long-lasting depression.
And yesterday, I showed you the numbers about how well we’re doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed.  And we’re back and very strong.  It’s a very strong “V.”  It’s almost a straight-up “V.”  We’ll be discussing that over the next couple of days.
But the economy is coming back, and the employment numbers over the last three months are a record in history of our country.  And we’ll be back next year.  I think we’ll be maybe even stronger than the previous years, where we set every record in the book: unemployment and stock market.
By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record.  And NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-13-2020/

1:30 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This is a historic day, and I have here with me Senior Advisor Jared Kushner, Ambassador Robert O’Brien.  They’re going to summarize the history that was made today and take a few of your questions.  We also have Special Representative Avi Berkowitz here; and Special Envoy to Iran, Brian Hook, who will be in attendance. 
     MR. KUSHNER:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  And thank you all for being here. 
     I want to start today by congratulating the people of Israel and the people of the United Arab Emirates.  Today is a historic breakthrough and a great day for peace. 
     I also want to congratulate President Trump on this milestone.  He worked very hard on this with his team.  We worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, who really are two visionary leaders who made a big step forward today to really change the region. 
     The last time we had an agreement like this in the region was 1994, when Israel made an agreement with the Kingdom of Jordan, which stopped aggression and helped bring forward peace. 
     Over the last 26 years, there’s been a lot of developments in the region — some positive, but many that have set the region back, and it has led to lots of lives being lost, lots of opportunity and hope being destroyed, and — and a region that really has had a lot of problems.
     When President Trump came into office, we had a caliphate for ISIS in the Middle East, which was the size of Ohio.  We had a lot of instability.  Iran’s aggression was being felt all throughout the region.  A lot of their proxies were very well funded and causing instability in Yemen and in Syria and in other places. 
     And now we’re in a position where we’ve been able to work with our allies.  A lot of our allies felt abandoned.  President Trump has been able to rebuild those relationships.  His first trip as President was to Saudi Arabia in May of 2017, where he laid out the problems that were facing the region and very clearly articulated that, in order to make progress, we’d all have to work together around common goals and we’d have to acknowledge historic differences and historic conflicts.  But we can’t let those conflicts hold us back. 
     President Trump’s leadership, the ability to build the relationships with the leaders in the region — people were modernizing their society and realizing that we needed a new paradigm.
     On President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, we made an agreement with a lot of these countries that we’re going to start a counterterror finance center.  And since then, we’ve worked to limit the amount of funding that’s gone to extremist groups. 
     We worked with Saudi Arabia, which is the custodian of the two holy sites, and we worked with them to do a counter center, a counter-extremism center to combat online extremism, and that’s made a big difference because you can’t solve the short-term problem without taking on the long-term fight.  We’ve seen Saudi Arabia make a lot of modernizations over the last years, giving more rights to women and taking steps in the right direction, which have been very positive.  And now today’s breakthrough really allows us to go forward. 
     To give you a little bit of background on this deal, this is something that’s been in discussions now for over a year and a half.  We were talking with Israel; we were talking with United Arab Emirates about moving forward.  Obviously, because of the Israeli elections and because of some other things that were happening in the region, this is something that was talked about but never really got to the right place for it to happen.
     As you know, with deals, deals happen when deals are ready.  And peace deals are very rare and very historic, and there’s a lot of reasons why people would be held back from moving forward. 
     What we saw was when the President rolled out his vision for peace, which we worked very hard on for a couple of years to really try to understand the issues in the region between the Israelis and Palestinians, he put forward 180 pages of detail on how we can address the issues of the past but also figure out how to move forward. 
     During that acknowledgement, President Trump was able to get Israel to agree to have a two-state solution with the Palestinians and, for the first time in history, to agree to a map that outlined the territory that they would be willing to work with in order to see that happen.  That showed a lot of people in the region that Israel was serious about really moving forward and making peace and also showed them that President Trump’s leadership and diplomacy could make things happen that hadn’t happened previously. 
     What happened is, as Israel was discussing with us providing — taking Israeli law and sovereignty to areas of the West Bank and applying it, we were having these discussions.  And over the last six weeks, the discussions between UAE and Israel started accelerating around this being a potential different path. 
     We all saw Ambassador Otaiba’s op-ed that came out that said that he thought applying Israeli sovereignty to this — to these areas would be detrimental to the region.  And a new course, a new option was created that was discussed that ultimately both countries thought was a much more viable option to go forward. 
     Israel has agreed to suspend those efforts at this time.  And as a result, we’re going to focus on bringing these two countries together.  This is really a historic breakthrough, and it shows that President Trump’s leadership, from the Riyadh speech until today — you see a much different Middle East than what he inherited.  And hopefully, there’s a lot more good things to come. 
     This is an icebreaker between these two countries.  This is the first Arab country to normalize relations with Israel in a long time — 26 years since Jordan.  And what we’re going to hopefully see from there is more countries start to do the same. 
     The final thing I’ll just say is that, here in America, the biggest threat that we saw in the last campaign was really two things.  One was ISIS.  The caliphate was growing, we were seeing journalists being beheaded, we were seeing people burnt in cages, and the threat of ISIS was something that was very scary to a lot of Americans and needed to be stopped.  The instability was providing a place for extremists to plan attacks, to plan all kinds of terrible things, and the extremists were trying to radicalize the next generation. 
     One of the biggest excuses that extremists use to radicalize the next generation is the mosque and — the Al-Aqsa Mosque — and saying that it’s being threatened and the fact that Muslims aren’t able to pray there.  This deal will allow for flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv, which will allow Muslims a real entrée to come and visit Israel peacefully and to come and pray at the mosque with whatever frequency they deem appropriate. 
     This is a big breakthrough.  As people go there and pray and see that this is available, they’ll share it with their friends and they’ll share the experiences, they’ll share pictures of it on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter, and people throughout the world will see that the mosque is safe and that — that all people are welcome there. 
     So this is a really great step forward for the region, a great step forward for the country, and a great step forward for the world.  And again, I just want to really compliment the three leaders who worked very hard to make this possible: Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, and President Trump here in America. 
     Thank you.
     MR. O’BRIEN:  So, thank you to Jared for that summary.  And it’s — it’s been extraordinary work by a number of fine diplomats, working under President Trump’s leadership, to arrive at today’s outcome.  Jared Kushner has been at the forefront of those efforts.   Avi, Brian Hook, and others have — have put in just — just tremendous work, under the President’s direction, to get where we are here today.
     And I know, Jared, you’re not a — you don’t have a diplomat-title or ambassador title, but we don’t have the finer ambassador, especially in the region, than Advisor Kushner.  So thank you for those — those remarks and for the really incredible effort. 
     I want to start by congratulating, today, the President of the United States; the Prime Minister of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu; and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  This is a remarkable achievement, and they’ve been — the achievement is now — will now be known in history as the “Abraham Accords,” or the “Ibrahim Accords” in the Muslim countries, or the “Avraham Accords” in Israel. 
     It’s something very special.  It’s something that doesn’t happen very often.  Very few of my predecessors, as National Security Advisor, have been able to come to this podium to announce a peace deal in the Middle East.  It’s a — it’s a very rare thing.
     As I said earlier in the Oval Office today, the President is going to be known in history as one of the change makers and one of the remarkable leaders in the Middle East.  And that’s not something that you may have thought of when he came into office.  But one of his very first steps was repairing our relationship with Israel, which had been badly damaged, especially in the last month of the prior administration. 
     The President did something that was unheard of.  Many presidential candidates, going back two decades, had promised that if they were elected, they would move the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  President Trump had the courage to do it, and he developed wonderful credibility and a reservoir of goodwill in Israel. 
     He recognized the Golan Heights as being Israeli territory, and — and took those away from a very — what could have been a very destabilized situation that we’ve seen develop in Syria. 
     He destroyed the physical caliphate of ISIS, which, Jared had said, was the size of Ohio.  It was — it stretched across the Middle East, and terror reigned because of the caliphate.
     He brought justice to al-Baghdadi, who had killed so many Americans: Sotloff and Mueller and Kassig and Foley. 
     He put maximum pressure on Iran and — and cut off much of the terrorist funding that was going to the proxy wars in Yemen, in Hezbollah, in Lebanon, in Syria, and throughout the region. 
     And today, we have the — the Abraham Accords.  He’s brought peace to the Middle East, at least peace between the UAE and Israel.  And what I have said is the President is often known as the greatest dealmaker, and he wrote the book “The Art of the Deal.”  And he’s considered a great, great dealmaker, which he is. 
     But I think history is going to remember the President for being a great peacemaker.  He brought peace to Israel and the UAE.  He has signed a — his diplomat signed a historic accord in Afghanistan.  I want to remind people that we haven’t had an American casualty in combat in Afghanistan since February 29th.
     He used his offices and his — his pressure to stop Idlib from being overrun in Syria, and brought a ceasefire agreement when — when Turkey had invaded Northern Syria. 
     A lot of people said that when he came into office that there would be war in North Korea.  But through personal diplomacy, he’s — has kept that situation from — from turning into a kinetic event.
     So, it’s really remarkable, I think, when you — when you step back and take a look at what this President has done on the peace front.  And it wouldn’t surprise me — it’ll take some time in this environment — but it wouldn’t surprise me if the President is eventually nominated for a Nobel Prize for the — this — today’s work is an example of why he would be rightly considered and should be a frontrunner for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
     So, I also want to compliment the courageousness of Mohammed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince.  You know, there have been two other great Arab leaders — King Hussein — in my lifetime, King Hussein and Anwar Sadat — who have made peace with Israel.  And now, Mohammed bin Zayed enters that pantheon of great, courageous Arab leaders. 
     And I want to compliment President — Prime Minister Netanyahu, in Israel, who was under tremendous pressure to extend Israeli law and sovereignty to portions of the country, but is — has stepped up against that political pressure to make peace.  Something that may have been politically popular, but he put the interest of his country and his people first.
     And so I think we’ve got some very courageous leaders that worked with the President to come to today’s tremendous historical accord. 
     Stepping back from — what does this mean beyond the historic idea of a major Arab country making peace with Israel all these years after 1948?  It makes sense on so many different levels.  The UAE and Israel are both capable security partners of the United States, and close — close partners of ours in the region, standing up to Iran, standing up to Islamic extremism.  They’ll — them — the peace agreement between these two countries will encourage and foster cooperation in those efforts. 
     These are very innovative countries.  Israel is called the “startup nation.”  And for those of you who have been there, it’s — you feel like you’re driving through Palo Alto through half the country.  The UAE is also a very innovative country.  Putting those two nations together is going to create a dynamic of innovation and creativity in the region.  And they — both countries are populated by incredibly dynamic people. 
     There are tremendous opportunities that are going to arise from this agreement.  Jared talked about the idea of Arab pilgrims and Muslim pilgrims going to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, going up to the Mount, and having the opportunity to pray in peace in Israel. 
     The — as you know, the President has made religious freedom, especially religious freedom in the Middle East, a center point — a centerpiece of his foreign policy.  And this is a great step towards fulfilling the idea that the three great faiths that came from the Holy City — Christianity, Judaism, and Islam — will be able to pray and interact peaceably together in that beautiful city of Jerusalem.
     Tourism, with — Abu Dhabi and Dubai and the other Emirates have become meccas for tourism, especially before the Chinese virus — the COVID virus.  Israel is a great land for tourism.  That’ll expand trade between the UAE and Israel, which both have incredible economies.  And again, as we — as we recover from COVID, this agreement will help the economies of those countries and the countries in the region expand.  And I think you’re going to see an increase in jobs in all three countries as a result of these accords.
     With respect to the peace process overall, we’ve got a great team.  That team is going to be fanning out.  We’re going to be on the — working the phones.  We’re going to be in the region.  And we believe that there are other countries waiting in the wings that are going to watch and see how the — the tremendous response to the courage of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Crown Prince have been received by their people and by the world.  And, I mean, I’ve — I’ve already been on the phone with a number of European counterparts who have called to congratulate us for our role in — in this accord but who are — some of whom were astounded that this took place.
     And we also think that this could lead to a great deal for the Palestinian people, that — it’s a people that the President of the United States, President Trump, has not forgotten.  And he’s — he’s endorsed the two-state solution.  He wants to see the Palestinian people in a prosperous country of their own.  And the groundwork has been laid for that, so I think we’ll be working very hard on those efforts in the — in the coming months and — and year.
     So, again, today is a great day.  It’s a great day for the people of the UAE, it’s a great day for the people of Israel, for their leaders.  And it’s also a great day for the United States of America as we played a role that we’ve traditionally played throughout the world, in coming in to mediate in difficult situations and — and achieve peace and achieve prosperity for our friends and neighbors.
     And again, I’m honored to be a part of the President’s team on this.  And again, I’ll end with congratulations to the President for his leadership, and again, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.  Thank you very much.
     MR. KUSHNER:  We’ll start with Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-13-2020/

5:56 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate you being here, and good evening.  As we continue to confront the China virus, we’re rebuilding America’s economy like nobody thought possible, actually.  We’re doing incredibly well.
The stock market is up almost 300 points again today.  While our economy is performing significantly better than Europe — which people have to understand very strongly; it’s performing better than any market anywhere in the world actually.  At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40 percent higher excess mortality than the United States.  And I will say that that’s a significant number.  We’re working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way.
We’re doing very well, as you know, on the vaccines and the therapeutics.  But think of that: We have the strongest economy — performing economy in the world.  We’re up — I think it’s $9 trillion since March — $9 trillion in value.  That’s a — that’s a number that nobody has ever heard of before.  We’re also getting close to about a 50 percent number since March, which is incredible.  So, it’s $9 trillion.  It’s almost 50 percent.  In fact, I think it went above 50 percent today with the 300 point increase.  And it’s — so we’re doing much better than Europe, significantly.  And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40 percent higher excess mortality than the United States.
I just want to mention because another number of judges were approved recently.  We’ll be, probably, over 300 judges –federal judges, including court of appeals judges — approved by the end of my first term.  And other than they — when they added new judges into somebody’s term, which happens seldom, but we have more than any — this is a record.  Nobody has ever seen anything like this in one term.  So we’re going to have over 300 federal judges, and that’s court of appeals judges, and that’s just in the first term.  It’s — probably we’ll finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing.
The stock market’s rebound signals a “V”-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world — stronger.  If you look, you’ll see exactly what we have.  We — we lead the world.  Japan is second.  But in terms of dollar value, it’s not even close.  So there it is.  A lot of great competitors: Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong.  The United States is leading the world, very substantially.
On the second slide, you’ll see the virus-induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations.  And you see that, right there; there’s the United States.  And that’s despite the fact that we’ve done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we’ve done more, by far, ventilators.  We’re building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we’re distributing them all over the world.  We’re helping other countries.
But despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal.  I’m sure you’d love to put them in your various media outlets.  I know you want to get that out.  If you want to leave the room early and do that, that would be fine.  The rapid recovery — but it would be nice to report it.
The rapid recovery of homebuilders’ sentiment points to massive new construction.  And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes, and that’s because people have tremendous confidence.  This is where we went, and the housing market has quickly rebounded.  We were at a record, and now we’re going to be at a record again very shortly.  Those numbers are incredible.  That’s where we are.  And we had to turn off the economy, and now we’re turning it back on, and that’s beyond a “V” shape.  This is going to be very strong; it’s called a “strong ‘V.’”
Automobile demand has increased 65 percent over the last three months.  Sixty-five percent automobile demand.  And we’re anticipating that that’s going to go up even further, but that’s more than any — anybody else.  The manufacturing sector — remember “manufacturing is dead,” according to the past administration of Obama and Biden?  “Manufacturing is dead. You’d need a magic wand.”  Well, you don’t need a magic wand.  You need competence and capability.  The manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at the highest reading since October of ’18, which is — was a — an extraordinary period of time.  And there we are.  That’s pretty good.
These are numbers that nobody has seen until just recently, and now they’re just coming out.  These are numbers that are leading — I guess, the stock market people, they’re very smart people.  I know many of them, and they’re seeing things that they don’t even believe.  So, the manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at its highest reading in a long, long time.
The economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last three years — a record, by far — and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted.  So, there you are.  You look at that, and that’s a record, and it’s a record for the quarter.  We had over 9 million — substantially more than 9 million jobs.
So those are incredible numbers about our economy and how it’s coming back.  It’s coming back very strongly, and it’s coming back at a level that’s far greater than anybody anticipated.  And we’re very proud of that.  And I give a lot of credit to all of our people — Steve and Larry.
And we’ll be talking about it.  If you have any questions on it — shouldn’t have any questions.  I didn’t — I didn’t print those charts.  Who did?  The economy (inaudible), let’s see.  I don’t know.  We’ll find that out for you, but it wasn’t us.  We took those — we took those numbers from somebody.  Where did you get those numbers, Larry?  They’re from where?
MR. KUDLOW: It’s from the BLS jobs report (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  BLS jobs report.
MR. KUDLOW:  The monthly jobs report, through July.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Everybody has that — everybody who needs?
The Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics.  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical leftwing agenda that the country doesn’t want and won’t accept.
For example, they’ve asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion — that’s billion — $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption.  You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race.  They should do that race over, by the way.  I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race.  When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner.  So, her opponent — I don’t know what’s happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy.
And then you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened.  And they admitted they made a mistake.  And many were sent to dead people and many were sent to — a number was sent — I guess, two — that at least two, three, four were sent to dogs.  One was sent to a cat.  They’re sent all over the place.  That was in Virginia.
In Paterson, New Jersey, they had a massive amount of voter fraud.  And it’s been a disaster.  Paterson, New Jersey has been total disaster — that’s universal mail-in voting.
So, they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country, where you have hundreds of millions of voters.  They can’t do a little race with 20,000 people; now they want to take it countrywide.  Mail-in voting — it’s going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections.  When you always talk about “Russia, Russia, Russia,” China, Iran on voting — your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran.  Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats.
But now the Democrats — they want $3.5 billion, think of it.  But now that they’re unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money — of course, we would never approve an amount like that.  And they also want $25 billion additional for the Post Office, Steve.  Twenty-five billion for the Post Office, so the Post Office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent, at random, all over the place.  They have no idea where they’re going.
So, they want $25 billion, and they want — think of this: They want $3.5 billion.  Would you say that’s enough to cover it?  I think we could do it for less, right?  I think we could do it for less.  But they want $25 billion for the Post Office because of this.
And remember, the new man — who is a great person, a great businessman — he just got there a little while ago.  The Post Office has been run poorly for many, many decades.  Great people in the Post Office, incredible people, but they’ve had very bad leadership for many years.  So, we’ll get it straightened out.
But they turned down this bill because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve.  So, they want $25 billion for the Post Office.  They want $2.5- or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in — $3.5 billion.  And the bill is not going to happen because they don’t even want to talk about it because we can’t give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus.  It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they’re asking for.  So, therefore, they don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting.  So, therefore, they can’t do it, I guess.  Right?
Are they going to do it even though they don’t have the money?  They’re asking for the $3.5 billion.  They’re asking for $25 billion for the Post Office so they can do this, I guess, and other things.  At $25 [billion], I would hope it would be a lot of other things, too.
But, therefore, they don’t have it.  They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in votes.  It’ll be the greatest rigged election in history.  It’ll be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated, other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign — President Obama, Biden, and everybody else.  And they got caught.  Let’s see what happens.  This will be one of the greatest frauds in history.
So they’re admitting that they want $3.5 billion, and they’re not going to do a deal that’s good for the American people.  Therefore, they’re not going to get the $3.5 billion.  Therefore, they can’t do the universal mail-in vote.  It’s very simple.  How are they going to do it if they don’t have the money to do it?
The Democrats are also holding up money for schools, and hospitals, and small businesses, and state and local governments.  They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action.  And I did executive orders, which are now in full force in effect, and they’re going forward.
I signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus.  That’s $400 more than the Democrats have provided.  Remember that: That’s $400 more than the Democrats have provided.
Nancy and Chuck haven’t provided anything.  And remember this: President Obama, when we had a problem — a pretty big problem; a very big problem — you know what he gave?  Twenty-five dollars.  He gave 25 bucks.  So now they say, “Well, we want to give $500 or we want to give $600.”  They don’t want to give.  They don’t even give anything.  They’re not doing anything.
But President Obama and Biden — Sleepy Joe — gave $25.  Twenty-five.  And they’ll complain, “Oh, we want to give more.”  Well, we’re giving $400, and that’s now in the works, and that’ll be getting out to the people soon, Steve.  Okay?  Remember that: $25 is what they gave the last time.  Twenty-five.
I want to make it unmistakably clear that I’m protecting people from evictions.  They didn’t want to do that.  The Democrats didn’t want to do a protection from evictions — people getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the “China virus,” whatever you want to call it.  We have 20 — now we’re up to 21 different names.  All we know is it came out of China, and it shouldn’t have.  They should have stopped it.
Under my executive order, HUD, HHS, and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes.  They’re not going to be evicted.  They are not going to be evicted.  And those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you’ll make sure of that.
I’m providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020.  That’s a tremendous amount of money that’s being supplied and given to families.  Tremendous.
The Democrats didn’t want to do a payroll tax.  They thought it was “too much money,” I guess, or it would make businesses too successful.  They don’t want to see success.  They certainly don’t want to see it before the election.  They certainly don’t want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there.  They don’t.  Because they say they can’t win with that kind of success.  They can’t win.  They have to get used to it.
Remember: We’ve already gotten $3 trillion in stimulus, so they should have probably negotiated a little bit differently.  Maybe they should have asked for all of this before they got most of the money and we gave it out — a lot of it to the people.
When we win the election — when I win the election, I’m going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape, or form hurting Social Security.  That money is going to come from the General Fund.  We’re not going to touch Social Security.  I said from day one that we’re going to protect Social Security, and we’re going to protect our people.  And Social Security is one of the things that will be protected.  Pre-existing conditions will be protected.  Medicare will be protected.
But Social Security will be totally protected under me.  Under them, it will not be protected because we will have a stock market crash the likes of which you’ve never seen.  Your taxes will be doubled and tripled.  And your regulations will go through the roof, which is what was causing the problems with the country in the first place.
Student loans: I signed a directive providing relief to student borrowers.  Not their fault that they can’t go to college.  I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.  So we’re going to take care of our students.  We have a lot of great students out there, and they — they got hit like everybody else.  So I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice.
And the payroll tax — we’ll be terminating the payroll tax after I, hopefully, get elected.  We’ll be terminating the payroll tax, so that will mean anywhere from $5,000 to even more per family, and also great for businesses and great for jobs.  A lot of people will be very happy to hear that.  A lot of the great — certainly, conservative economists will be great to have — they think that’s the greatest thing we can do.  That’s better than the payments; that’s better than anything else.
But it’s a lot of money, and it’s — it’s going right directly to the people, and it goes there very easily.  But it also creates stronger companies to employ the people.  So we will be — on the assumption I win, we are going to be terminating the payroll tax after the beginning of the new year.
Today, I met with parents, students, teachers, and health experts to discuss the vital importance of safety and safely reopening America’s schools.  This evening, I’ll outline the commonsense recommendations that should guide schools as they reopen with precautions.  We want to be very, very safe and very careful — so, precautions in place.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide as we race toward the competition — and the completion — we’re competing with us, but I’m not completing — competing with anyone.  We just want to have a vaccine.  We have — we’re dealing with other countries, and we want them to do well.  We’re giving them whatever information they need.  We’re all working towards something that will happen.  It will happen before the end of the year — maybe substantially before, but before the end of the year.  And therapeutics will happen, likewise, even sooner.
But we’re looking for that responsible path forward to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to resume work and school and play football.  Go play football.
I spoke to some of the great football players — college players — Trevor and a lot of great players.  Called Coach — a coach called “Coach O.”  A lot of fantastic people I got to speak to — athletes, leaders.  They want to play football.  Let them play.  Let them play.  And they’ll — they feel safer in the field than they do walking around and doing nothing.
So, hopefully, that will happen.  And hopefully, when they play football, they will proudly stand for the National Anthem and they will proudly stand and — and respect the American flag — or at least I’m not watching.  I can’t speak for others, but based on what I see now and based on what I’m looking at, with respect to the NBA at this point, a lot of people agree with me.  So we want people — we would like to request people — you stand proudly for the flag and for the National Anthem.
In the months since the virus arrived, we’ve learned a great deal.  While this is a dangerous and highly infectious disease, it primarily affects the oldest segment of our population or those with chronic health issues.
The United States has the largest nursing home and assisted-living home population in the Western world, by far.  Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
The median age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old.  These findings underscore that all Americans must continue to apply extreme vigilance in protecting our elderly population and those with chronic conditions.  Outcomes are very different for younger Americans without serious health issues — tremendously different.  They can often expect mild or moderate symptoms or even no symptoms whatsoever.  They have very strong immune systems, we’ve learned — even more so than we ever thought.
In a typical year, approximately five times as many Americans under the age of 65 die from heart disease as have so far been lost to the coronavirus from the same age group.  That’s an interesting statistic.
Bless- — blessedly, children appear to face the lowest risk of all.  It’s 99.995 percent of all fatilities [fatalities] are adults.  Think of that: 99.95.  That is extremely close to 100 percent of all fatilities [fatalities] are adults.
Children often have only mild symptoms, and medical complications are incredibly rare — very, very, very rare.  Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions.  In each of the last five years, the flu resulted in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to coronavirus, by far.  The flu — the flu does kill young people.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and protect students.  All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstances.  This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at a high risk.
And one of the things we’d like to do is when we make payment to schools — because we spend a lot of money on schools — we’d like to make the payment directly to the student or to the child.  And that would be to the parents, essentially, but to the child.  We want to follow the child so that if a school is closed, the family can go to another school, maybe in another area, but they can do it.  And we’d like to make that payment — rather than paying a school that’s closed, we’d rather pay directly.  We’re following the child — where the child goes.  And we want to pay the family, pay the child, and then the family can take care of the cost.
And we’re trying to get that approved too, but the Democrats don’t like doing anything, unless it means doing for the union, which controls Nancy and controls Chuck 100 percent.  And I have nothing wrong with the union.  I have great respect, more than — very few people do I respect more than a great teacher.  That’s a tremendous talent.  They — they’re really underappreciated.  These are phenomenal people with tremendous talent — the great ones are among the most important people we have in this country.
But — and they’ll be great at other — they’ll be great at charter schools.  And they’ll be great at — well, we talk about school choice, which we’d like to see so that parents can take their children to the school of their choice.  That’s something we want.  We think it’s very important, especially in the minority communities.  They want it so badly.  African American, Hispanic American, Asian American — they want it so badly.
But the two people I mentioned, Nancy and Chuck, they’re totally controlled by the heads of the union.  I think the teachers like us a lot.  We’re taking care of our teachers.  We want to take care of our teachers.
But we cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional, and academic development, and inflicting long-term, lasting damage.
I heard a gentleman today, a great person — some of you were at that meeting — from Harvard, say that every year is $10,000.  It’s a — people — they lose a tremendous amount of money in the future.  He mentioned $10,000.  And I think he was talking about on a yearly basis.  They lose a lot by every year of education that they lost.  Every year they gain, they gain $10,000.  And when you have students sitting at home, playing with a computer, it’s not the same.  That’s one thing we’ve learned for sure: It’s not the same.  It can never be the same as being in a classroom.  So we want to get our students in the classroom.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommendation that schools reopen.  They said, “Reopen.”  It said, quote, “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits.”  The doctors, also warned about the risk of increased abuse, substance use, depression, and suicide.  Suicide.
The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.”  So when you sit at home in a basement, looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away.  We have a lot of good experience at that, just by taking a look at what’s happening in politics.
Studies estimate that school closures last spring caused the average student to fall 50 percent behind in math and roughly 35 percent in reading compared to a typical year.  Think of that: It caused the average student to fall 50 percent behind in math and 35 percent in reading, compared to being at the school, being with your teachers, being in a classroom.  We’ve learned that.  We’ve learned that learning from a laptop is not great.
And, frankly, we’ve also learned that telehealth — a little unrelated, but it’s up 35,000 percent, and it’s been incredible — 35,000 percent.  We’ll check that number later, but that’s an incredible — but it is, people staying home.  And the telehealth — that has been a tremendous success.
We’ve learned those two things during this period of time with the — with the plague — with the plague coming in.  And those are two things we know.
School closures harm low-income students the most because they have less access to high-quality remote learning — they don’t have computers — and less resources for academic support.
All schools should be making plans to resume in-person classes as soon as possible.  To support the reopening of America’s schools, we provided $13 billion in elementary and secondary schools toward the CARES Act and CARES Act funding — we’re giving CARES Act funding — the vast majority of which remain available for states to use.  So, a tremendous amount of money: $13 billion.  That’s the CARES Act funding and we’re giving a large portion of that for states to use.
Today, I’m pleased to announce that we will provide up to $125 million reusable masks to various school districts all around the country.
My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen.
Finally, today my administration is highlighting general recommendations for all schools and guidance to protect high-risk teachers and students.  We’re working very, very closely with many of the schools and school districts throughout the country.
They include the following:


To ensure all students, teachers, and staff understand the symptoms of the China virus.
Require all students, teachers, and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school.
Encourage frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing during the school day, beginning upon entrance to school, and ensuring that hand-washing facilities are widely available throughout the school.  And, for the most part, schools have been very good at that.
Minimize large indoor gatherings.  Hold large gatherings outdoors whenever possible.
Maintain high standards of hygiene and ventilation within the classrooms, including keeping windows and doors open whenever possible, and running fans and air conditioning units whenever possible.
Require students, teachers, and staff to socially distance around high-risk individuals and socially distance whenever possible in any event.
Encourage the use of masks when social distancing is not possible.
Post instructions regarding hygiene and social distancing all over the school and all around the school.


We encourage schools to adopt these measures.  We’ve been working with so many of them.  And, to the best of my knowledge, virtually every one of them agrees to do that.
While we’re also providing high-risk teachers and students options to engage in distance teaching or learning, we’re working on that also.  College-age students also continue to be one of the lowest-risk demographics.  More than 99.8 percent of the deaths from this horrible disease — “the invisible enemy,” we call it — occur in people over 24 years of age.  Think of that: 99.8 percent occur in people over 24 years of age.
For this reason, it could be safer for them to live at a school rather than live with their older parents or grandparents.  They got to go to school.  We got to open up.  We got to open up our schools and open up our businesses.  And a lot of it has been open, but we can do better.
As we move forward, the number of cases is not, by any means, the most important metric to focus on because the fact is we have more cases because we have far more testing than any country in the world.  There’s no country that’s even close.
We’ve done more testing and better testing than any country.  And many of these countries that the media was putting up as a shining example of success, they’re, right now, in massive outbreaks.  You see what’s going on in many of the countries that you constantly mention.
Far more important is who the virus is infecting.  That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require hospitalization or result in death — those that afflict the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions — all the while acting to prevent hospital overcrowding.
If you look at some of the states that had a flare-up recently, they’re all doing very well.  Florida is going down rapidly.  I want to give a lot of credit to the governors.  Florida is going down, and Arizona is going down, way down.  They’ve done a fantastic job.  California, as you know, is going down.  And many other locations — it’s doing very well.  And many locations are really in fantastic shape — some with very little, if any, problem — large portions of the United States.
Those advocating for a never-ending, blanket, nationwide lockdown have no answer for what it would do to the mental, physical, and social health of millions of American children and people.  This includes parents, where they have to stay home with their children because — and they lose their work and they lose their job because their children isn’t at school.  They have to have somebody to take care of it, and they want to take care of their child.  They don’t trust people.  A society must put the health and safety of our children first.
A man who has the respect of everybody — he’s highly respected by me and anybody on this subject.  He’s just the expert.  Dr. Scott Atlas is here from Stanford, and he’s been working with us for a period of time.  And I thought it would be great — he was saying things to me the other day.  I said it would be great if you could tell that to the media.
So this is the first time I’ve shared the platform.  And it’s an honor to do so.  Scott is truly — he’s a brilliant man.  He’s a wonderful man.  And he cares about the subject very much.  And I’d like to ask Scott to come up please and say a few words.
Thank you, Scott.
DR. ATLAS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s obviously a great honor to be here and a great honor to serve this President, who’s really focused on the very important parts of the pandemic.
And I’m new here.  I’m just, sort of, getting involved, but I want to thank you and the Vice President and the entire team, the task force team, and all the people who are not very visible, really, for working so hard.  These people are working 24/7, and it’s — it’s quite amazing.
And I think that we — today, we had a fantastic event, that I’ll just mention, on opening the schools, because the President’s priority is to open the schools and open them safely and have parents have the options to either use open schools or do whatever they can to eventually get back to open schools, including any kind of hybrid or other arrangement they may want to do.
It was a great event.  We had a group of fantastic parents, teachers, medical experts, and it went very well.  And so I won’t spend a lot of time up here, but thank you very much and I hope I can help out in some way.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Steve?  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-081320/

5:37 P.M.  EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Nice to be with you all.  Good evening. 
    Before providing today’s update on the China virus, I want to address the violence, looting, and rioting taking place in the Democrat-controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle.  The mayors and governors of these states and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death. 
    New York City has an army of great police.  I know them very well.  And the law enforcement and the New York’s Finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job.  If they do their job, if they’re allowed to do their job,   the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly.  They do it well. 
    The mayor, Bill de Blasio, should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired without justification.  They were fired.  I guess that’s part of “Defund the Police” by the Democrats.  They should hire New York City’s Finest back.  You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do, actually, when it comes to terrorism and other things. 
    Together, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs, and Guardsmen available to quell any violence.  They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs — again, if allowed to do their jobs.  Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do their jobs.  The Democrats or the radical-left Democrats — or both, because they’re becoming one and the same, if you look at election results — the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left. 
    The city of Portland and the state of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and Guardsmen available.  Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available.  So Seattle — the city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people.  They have to be allowed to do their job.  I’m urging them to deploy these resources to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on — although a lot of the, unfortunately, fake news don’t like to put it on because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement.  They have to put it on.  They have to be honest with the people of this country. 
    But I’m offering all available federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals.  We have to be asked by the governors or the mayors, and we’ll be there very rapidly.  It’s ready, willing, and able.  We’re all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them.  We’ll do them very quickly.  You saw what happened in Minneapolis; they ripped the city apart.  When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately.  It was immediate and lasted. 
    These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent, leftwing extremism that you get to see if you’re watching the right news program.  Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of leftwing domestic terrorism.  They really are anarchists.  These are leftwing anarchists.  They are anarchists.  And I’m directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists — immediately, to stop them — and to work with the city and the state to get the job done. 
    Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately.  We’ll work with you.  And the local authorities know who they are.  They know where they come from.  They know a lot about them.  They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we’re ready to help.  If you need that help — you shouldn’t need that help, actually.  You should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well.  Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job. 
    What you’re seeing in Portland and Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America.  They want every city in America to resemble Portland, in a form.  They want to pass federal legislation gutting and hamstringing every police department in America.  They want to get rid of your Second Amendment.  They want to end cash bail; close prisons; defund police departments — or at least largely defund.  You see that with New York.  A billion dollars they took out of their police department, and crime has gone through the roof.  And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens.  If the left gains power, no city, town, or suburb in our country will be safe. 
    On the vaccine front, some very good news.  Today, I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. 
    We heard an update from the top scientists and the government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which, right now, aren’t too thrilled with me.  They’re taking millions of dollars’ worth of ads because I’ve created a favored-nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70 percent in some cases — numbers that have never been heard or thought of.  So when you see those ads, remember: That means your drug prices are coming down.  When you see ads attacking your President, it’s very simple — that means drug prices are going to be falling very soon.
    This evening, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate.  The federal government will own these vaccine doses; we’re buying them. 
    Recently, we also secured partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to support the large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines.  Doing very well on those vaccines — tremendous promise in every single one of them, and we have many of them.  And they’re years ahead of schedule.  This would have been — if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years. 
    Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already — the final stage of clinical trials.  This is the final stage.  We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery.  The military is ready to go.  They’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA, and we’re moving very close to that approval. 
    We’re on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses, as soon as the vaccine is approved, and up to 500 million shortly thereafter.  So we’ll have 600 million doses.  Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history. 
    We’ve treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma.  A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results which are incredible.  We look to a reduction and reduced mortality rate by 50 percent, and possibly even more than 50 percent. 
    I urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate.  We would really appreciate that because it’s been very successful — unbelievably successful — and we would love you to go and donate.
    As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible.  You’ve seen the numbers.  You see what’s going on yesterday, today — and tomorrow, in my opinion.  We’re very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401(k) numbers and everything else.
    Today, the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time, more than a 50 percent surge since just March.  So we’ve increased by 50 percent more than since just March.  It has gained approximately 9,500 points that same period — March — and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our nation — think of that.
    America’s economy is incredible, and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations.  Last quarter, the European Union’s GDP decline was nearly 40 percent worse than the United States.  So it’s 40 percent worse than the United States.  We’ve built such a strong base that we’re able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world, by far.
    France’s GDP decline was nearly 80 percent worse than ours.  And Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States.
    Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic — very substantial improvements.  Since last week, 87 percent of the counties in the United States report declining cases.  Think of that: 87 percent of the counties in the United States, they reported declining cases.
    Mortality has declined by 7 percent, and hospitalizations are declining rapidly.  States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25 percent.  But all Americans must remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible.  Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask.  And protect the elderly — always protect the elderly. 
    Since the end of July, the seven-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20 percent, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe.
    Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in three months — not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media.  The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62 percent since last week, unfortunately — and that is truly unfortunate.  It’s increased 82 percent in France, 113 percent in Spain, and 30 percent in the United Kingdom.  Those are big increases.  Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries.  And in our country, they’re going down.  We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by — a short time. 
    Even though America is the largest at-risk population — including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries — Europe has experienced a nearly 40 percent higher excess mortality rate than the United States.  We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-state area — which had a very, very hard time — and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill — something that the news doesn’t tell you.  They don’t tell you that.  They don’t like to tell you that.
    The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world.  India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people, has done 24 million.  So we’re at 66 million.  And think of it: India is at 24 million, and India is second. 
    The entire region of Latin America, comprising 33 countries, has conducted 25 million tests.  Yet, Latin America has more confirmed cases, by far, than the United States. 
    As we safely restore our great economy and reopen our schools — and hopefully we can watch colleges play football.  We want to get football in colleges.  These are young, strong people.  They won’t have a big problem with the China virus.  So we want to see college football start, and, hopefully, a lot of great people are going to be out there.  They’re going to be out there, playing football, and they’ll be able to fight it off.  And hopefully, it won’t bother them one bit.  Most of them will never get it, statistically.  But we know we’ll see more cases at some point, and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity, in addition to everything else that we’re doing.
    So, college football, get out there and play football.  People want to see it.  And stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem because people are not happy when that doesn’t happen. 
    You look at the NBA and what’s happening with the NBA and their poor ratings.  I don’t know; can’t imagine why.  But they didn’t stand, they didn’t show respect to our flag.  They didn’t show respect to our anth- — our National Anthem.  And maybe that’s having an impact, but just not good.
    The NFL had its problems, two years ago, when that happened.  They went way down in their ratings and their fans, and they struggled back.  And now, all of a sudden, they’re putting themselves in the same position.  So stand for your flag and stand for the National Anthem, and I think you’re going to do fantastically well.  Because a lot of people aren’t going to watch if you don’t; I’m one of them.
    That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death.  We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population.  We’ve learned that, I think, more than any single event, Scott.  We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population, and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness — diabetes, in particular. 
    And we are, at the same time, in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding.  We’re in great shape.
    On the nursing-home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy.  HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities as they continue to combat the China virus. 
    We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes.  And we’re in the process of delivering these vice- — devices to all 15,000 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes by the end of September.  So they’re going to have very, very rapid tests.  They won’t have to wait around two or three days or four days. 
    And that number has come down very substantially, compared to what it was.  When you send it to the labs, you get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it, and then to send it back.  But we are now at a position where we’re sending very, very rapid tests — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.
    We will care for America’s seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics.  And therapeutics are coming along very, very well.  We think we have some great answers on therapeutics, and you’ll be hearing that — about them in the very near future.  I’m very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital, and you give a shot, or you do what you have to do with a, perhaps, transfusion.  There’s combinations of what you can do, and people get better.  I like that very much.  I like that very, very much. 
    And that could even precede — and it’s successful in getting it — that will, I think, probably, even precede vaccines.  But therapeutically, we’re doing very, very well.  A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that we’re — that I’m seeing, and some of the results. 
    So, tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front, and our country should be very proud of itself.  We’re going to get it delivered very rapidly, as soon as it comes out.

    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I thought I’d start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed — just the news.  Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the state of Virginia, including to many dead people.  This was an unprecedented mailing flub that’s heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts.  It’s a disaster — all over Virginia, half a million votes.  So that’s something you have to think about. 
    We don’t want to have a rigged election, I know that.  And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia or you mention China or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system.  And when you have this mail-in voting, it’s a — it’s very susceptible.  It’s something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans.  And I think that it’s something you have to start thinking about very seriously. 
    Our system is not equipped for it.  The Post Office is not equipped for it.  And people should vote, like they did in World War One and World War Two.  And your numbers will be — in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think — much better — on the coronavirus or the China virus.  But it’s something you have to look about — look at and say, “This is just crazy.” 
    This just came out: half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the state of Virginia to many people that weren’t living.  They had some sent to pets — dogs.  This is what we’re going to get into, and it’s going to be a disaster.  And it’s going to be thought of very poorly, and it’s going to hurt our country. 
    After our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement — we’re pro-jobs, pro-health safety — executive orders — the stock market went up 358 points today.  So we — we issued those executive orders, and the stock market went up 358 points today.  It’s quite a reaction.
    The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50 percent since March — 50 percent.  Think: If you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you have 50 percent.  The Nasdaq index continues to set new records.  It’s been up over 14 times; new record in Nasdaq. 
    And the S&P 500 and the Dow — Dow Jones are going to be — I mean, the way they’re going, it looks like they’re just about going to be topping records, hopefully, soon.
    SECRET SERVICE AGENT:  Sir, we’re just going to have to step out in the hall (inaudible).
    THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me?

     MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Democrats in Congress failed to act in the best interests of Americans hardest hit by this pandemic.  Amid inaction, President Trump stood up for every American who, through no fault of their own, needed relief.
     Politics as usual should find no place during this pandemic, but Democrats rejected multiple clean bills to provide relief.  The American people are tired of games.  They seek leadership, and President Trump delivered.
     This weekend, President Trump took executive action designed to provide the relief Democrats have denied to those who need it most.  Through four executive orders, he took the following steps:
     On the payroll tax, he deferred payments of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st through the end of 2020. 
     On unemployment assistance, states will provide 25 percent cost sharing, amounting to a total of $400 per week in benefits through the end of the year.
     And then, third, he extended the eviction protections.  President Trump will direct HUD to prevent evictions resulting from financial hardships caused by the virus, doing everything in his executive capacity to make sure those renting and those homeowners are protected.
     Finally, on student loans, he extended 0 percent interest and suspended loan payments through the end of the year.
     The bottom line is that these actions will help Americans.  President Trump is for the American people, and Democrats failed to deliver.
     Also, earlier this year, hundreds of Americans — working men and women — at the Tennessee Valley Authority — the TVA — were told that they would lose their jobs to lower-paid foreign workers imported from abroad, and then ser- — suffered the further indignity of training their foreign replacements.
     President Trump boldly and resolutely intervened in defense of these hardworking Americans — rallying to their case, rushing to their aid, and taking action to restore their jobs.  He invited laid-off workers and their representatives to the White House, and then he fired the chairman of the board of the TVA and one other board member.
     President Trump offered an ultimatum: The firings would continue until the cruel and heartless decision to fire the hardworking Americans was reversed.  TVA did reverse.  Layoffs have been canceled, and tech workers have been rehired. 
     In the words of Gay Henson, president of the Engineering Associates, IFPTE, Local 1937 — the labor union representing the 2- — the 2,200 highly skilled professionals employed by the TVA — in Ms. Henson’s words, “The President’s personal intervention saved these jobs, restored the workers to their rightful place, and set TVA on the path to returning to its mission of service to both the workers at the TVA and to the people of this country.”
     And, with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-10-2020/

Bedminster, New Jersey

4:21 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you, and good afternoon.  My administration has been working around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats on additional China virus relief.
Already, my administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief, saving many tens of millions of dollars and jobs.  And you see how fast the economy is coming back.  It does look like it’s going to be a very sharp “V.”  We have tremendous enthusiasm, tremendous spirit, and tremendous job growth.  We set a record on number of jobs in the last three months.  It’s the most jobs ever created in a three-month period — during a three-month period.  That’s great.
Before we begin, I’ve just signed two bills that are great for our vets.  Our vets are very special.  We passed Choice, as you know — Veterans Choice — and Veterans Accountability.  And they’ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no President has ever been able to do it.  And we got it done so veterans have Choice.  And now you have Accountability — that if you don’t love your vets, if you’re in the VA and you don’t love the vets or take care of the vets, you can actually get fired if you don’t do your job.  We want people that love our vets.
The first expands the eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes.  So we have an expansion of benefits, an expansion of various elements of being and working with the VA for vets with blindness and — in particular, blindness in both eyes.  And we have a lot of problems with blindness in the VA, and we’re doing something about it.  They’ve been talking about this for many years.  So that is expanding eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes.  Okay?
Second is — requires the VA to establish a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes.  And you know what that all means, and it’s really something that they’ve been trying to get done for a long time.  The second requires the VA to establish a treatment court.  So this is a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes.  Okay?  I think it’s self-explanatory.
We’ve wanted this for a long time, they’ve been trying to get it for a long time, and now we have it.  And I want to thank everybody for helping us get that done.  We had a lot of support from a lot of great people, including people in the VA.
In the current negotiations, we have repeatedly stated our willingness to immediately sign legislation providing expanded unemployment benefits, protecting Americans from eviction, and providing additional relief payments to families.  Democrats have refused these offers; they want to negotiate.  What they really want is bailout money for states that are run by Democrat governors and mayors, and that have been run very badly for many, many years — and many decades, in fact.  You know the states; everybody knows who we’re talking about and what we’re talking about.  I don’t think we have to go over it.
But what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money.  It has nothing to do with the China virus.  It has nothing to do with anything that we’ve been talking about over the last period of time.  They want to bailout states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years — and, in fact, in all cases, many decades.  And we’re not willing to do that.
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demands and the radical-left Democrats, and we just can’t do that.  So, hopefully, we can do something with them at a later date, but we’re going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important, and will take care of, pretty much, this entire situation.
As we know it and as you have been covering it in some cases — actually covering it accurately — many of the far-left policies they’re pushing have nothing to do, again, with what we have been working on so hard — namely, the corona.  You can call it so many different names.  What a horrible thing China released upon the world.
One third of their bill — the HEROES Act — is spending completely unrelated money to the virus.  Here are just a few of the policies in their extreme-left bill.  And, again, this is a bill supported by Biden, and Biden is totally controlled now by the Bernie Sanders left wing of the party.  And, in fact, he’s gone further left than Bernie Sanders ever dreamt of going.  So, obviously, other than Bernie have brought him left.  If you look at the manifesto that they’ve agreed to, it’s far further left than I’ve ever heard anything about Bernie Sanders.
The massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states we talked about — that’s one of the things they’re looking to do.  Measures designed to increase voter fraud.  Banning voter ID; they want to ban voter ID.  We should have voter ID in every state.  Every state should have voter ID.  You have ID on everything you do, practically, yet every- — everybody has voter ID.  Everybody has ID except for voters.  When you vote, you don’t want ID; they don’t want —
We have some states with it; it works out great.  And if you want to stop fraud in elections, have voter ID.  They want measures designed to increase voter fraud, which is banning voter ID in all states and banning requirements for signature verification in federal elections.
Now, why would they want, in this bill — which really has nothing to do with what we’re talking about: stimulus — something banning voter ID?  In every single state, they want to ban it, including states where we already have it, because we have some states where we have it — Indiana and others that do very well.
Why would they want to ban voter ID in all states?  And why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in federal election?  Who would want a bill banning signature verification?  What’s that all about?
You know what it’s about?  Fraud.  That’s what they want: fraud.  They want to try and steal this election because, frankly, it’s the only way they can win the election.
The bill also requires all states to do universal mail-in balloting — which nobody is — nobody is prepared for — regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure.  They want to steal an election.  That’s all this is all about: They want to steal the election.
So, in the bill, they have a bill that requires all states to do universal mail-in balloting, regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure.  Like in Nevada, it’s such a disaster.  Their infrastructure is a total disaster.  They don’t want to have signature verification, they don’t want to have any of the safeguards that you need, and they don’t want to have safeguards that are so common and so basic and even other states that we disagree with have.  This Nevada thing is a mess, but we’ll see how the courts determine — what the courts determine.  But they certainly don’t have the infrastructure in Nevada.  So we’ll see how it is.
As you know, we brought suit last week, and we’ll see how that all works out.  I think we’re going to win it.  But, basically, what they’re trying to do with all of these requirements, including no signature verification: They’re trying to steal an election.
And I was in Ohio, I was in Texas, I was in Florida over the last four or five days.  And if you would see the crowds along the highways and the roadways, people have said they’ve never seen anything like it, and they haven’t seen anything like it.  And the press doesn’t report it because they’re fake news.
They even want to force states to implement the controversial practice known as “ballot harvesting” — a very dangerous practice — meaning they would allow Democrat Party operatives to deposit thousands and thousands of completed ballots at the post office without any verification of who filled them out, including a verification of signatures on the ballots.  So you’re not even going to have a verified signature.  Anybody — I could sign it.  You could sign it.  Anybody in this room could sign it.  And that’s going to count as a vote.  How can you do a thing like this?
So this is what they’re asking for.  This is what Nancy Pelosi and Crying Chuck Schumer are asking for.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay?  It’s ridiculous.  It’s horrible.  It’s a horrible thing.
The Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.  So if you were able to get into our country illegally — and our border is, as you know, doing very well right now.  We have a very strong border, and the wall is up to 276 miles.  And we’ll be completed with it around the end of the year.  We’re going to do some extra mileage in certain areas that people didn’t realize were so bad, so we’ll be completed with it.  Right after, we’re going to do the additional mileage.  We’ll do it probably a little bit after the year.
I think, from what I’ve heard, Joe Biden — Sleepy Joe — wants to rip the wall down.  He wants people to pour into our country.  They want to have open borders.  We don’t want to have open borders.
So the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens.  They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention.  They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons.  How do you like that one?  And this is in the bill that we’re talking about?  What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy?  What does this have to do with the coronavirus?  Another name.  What does this have to do with this?
So, think of that: They required the mass release of illegal aliens from detention.  What does this have to do with what we’re trying to do?  They want to put this — and this is a radical-left policy, so they can go to Portland and try and rip the place apart that they’ve been doing for many years and they’ve been doing for years and years.
They also compel the mass release of inmates.  What does this have to do with what we’re talking about?  This is Nancy Pelosi — Crazy Nancy — and Chuck Schumer.  They want to compel you to do this stuff, and this has nothing to do with what we’re talking about, and it includes serious felons.  They want to have these people released on a mass basis, including serious felons.
That’s page 1,689; page 1,762.  Think of it: 1,762.  And that’s nowhere near the end of their bill.  They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read.  These people — I don’t — I honestly don’t believe they love our country, you want to know the truth.
In addition to demanding these extreme partisan provisions, Democrats are actively blocking the following measures: support for K-12 schools to help them safely open, additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to help millions of workers on the payroll.  This is a great program.  Very successful.  Kept a lot of businesses open.  That’s why we’re doing so well in reopening our country.  Additional money for hospitals.  Testing and vaccines.  Direct payments of $3,400 for a family of four.
Now, remember, this is what the extreme partisans — this — we got — we have to — this is what we’re talking about.  Democrats are actively blocking the things that we want.  And what we want is good for people.  Those — these are things that they’re blocking: support for K-12 schools, so they can open.  Think of that.
Also, direct payments of the $3,400 for a family of four-plus, then funding for childcare and mental health care.  And you need that, especially when you have so much of a lockdown.  You need that: mental health care.
Funding for broadband, airports, and agriculture, rental assistance, and support for community banks and credit unions to help them provide $100 billion in loans to the hardest-hit communities, including rural communities and farmers.  They don’t want anybody to get that.  Democrats are obstructing all of it.
Therefore, I’m taking executive action.  We’ve had it.  And we’re going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers, and I’ll be signing these bills in a very short period of time.
First one is on providing a payroll tax holiday to Americans earning less than $100,000 per year.  In a few moments, I will sign a directive, instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st.  And we’re actually going to be making that; we just got the word.  We’re just getting some word from a lot of people.  We didn’t think we’d have to do this because we thought the Democrats would be reasonable, but they’ve been not only unreasonable, they’ve been ridiculous.
So we’re going to make that August 1st, most likely.  It’ll be August 1st.  We’ll let you know the exact date, but we’re looking like August 1st.  So it’d be August 1st through the end of 2020.  This will mean bigger paychecks for working families, as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the China virus once and for all.
And we’re doing very good with the numbers.  You see it’s going down in Arizona very, very substantially and rapidly.  Going down in California.  Going down in Texas.  Going down in Florida.  Other areas are propping up a little bit, but we’re watching them very closely.  We understand the disease, and we’re watching them very closely, especially our senior citizens and our senior citizens’ residences.
If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.  So I’m going to make them all permanent.
Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that.  They don’t want that because they’re adding $3 trillion in taxes.  So they’ll have the option of raising everybody’s taxes and taking this away.
But if I win, I may extend and terminate.  In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.  And so, we’ll see what happens.  Biden probably won’t be doing that; you’ll have to ask him.  I don’t think he knows what he’s doing.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter and applause.)
THE PRESIDENT:  Second, I’m signing an executive order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS, and CDC to make sure renters and homeowners can stay in their homes.
So I’m protecting people from eviction.  Yet you’ve been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction.  I said, “Let’s do that separately.  That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live.”  And they didn’t even want to protect people from eviction.
So, they would get evicted — it’s not their fault that this virus came into our country; it’s China’s fault.  And came into the world — by the way, a lot of the people, a lot of the states that were doing the best are having some problems.  A lot of the states that we weren’t thinking were doing the best are doing very well.
You look at some of the countries involved.  Some of the countries that were really standing out as examples are now exploding.  But they’ll get it down; they understand it.  We’re dealing with them.  We’re dealing with a lot of countries.
We’re providing thousands and thousands of ventilators all over the world right now.  We make a lot of ventilators.  We started off with very little, and we’re making a lot.  And we have thousands in our stockpile, but we’re making thousands a month.  And we’re providing many of them — thousands and thousands — to other countries that would never be able to get them.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, and work with landlords and lenders to keep Americans safely in their homes.  So we don’t want people being evicted.  And the bill — the act that I’m signing will solve that problem, largely — hopefully, completely.
The third action I’m taking today will also provide additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus.  Under the CARES Act, I proudly signed expanded unemployment benefits into law.  Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief.  They even oppose measures that would give bonuses to workers returning to the job.  They were totally opposed to that.
For this reason, I’m taking action to provide an additional or an extra $400 per week in expanded benefits: $400.  Okay?  So, that’s generous, but we want to take care of our people.  Again, it wasn’t their fault; it was China’s fault.
States will be asked to cover 25 percent of the cost using existing funding, such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the Coronavirus Relief Fund.  Under this plan, states will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose, and the federal government will cover 75 percent of the cost.  So we’re all set up.  It’s $400 per week.
And we’re doing that without the Democrats.  We should have been able to do it very easily with them, but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people.
Fourth, I am signing a directive providing relief to student loan borrowers.  Earlier this year, we slashed student loan interest rates to zero.  I don’t know if people know that because the press doesn’t ever report it, but maybe they’re watching now.
AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT:  The press doesn’t report a lot of good things that are good for the people and good for the country.
Earlier this year, we slashed student loans’ interest rates to zero percent and suspended student loan payments, and Congress extended that policy through September 30th.  Today, I’m extending this policy through the end of the year, and we’ll extend it further than that — most likely, right after December 1st.  So we look like we’re going to be extending that.  They’re paying zero interest.  And again, not their fault that their colleges are closed down and not their fault that they’re unable to get what they bargained for.
Through these four actions, my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to Americans struggling in this difficult time.  And the beautiful thing about this difficult time is we’re now coming back and setting records.
We’ll also ensure that our economic comeback continues full speed ahead.  And with the $400 and all of the other measures that we’re talking about and will be signing in a little while, that will happen.
We’re further looking at additional tax cuts, including income tax relief, income tax cuts, and capital gains tax cuts.  So we’re going to be looking at that — capital gains — for the purpose of creating jobs, and income tax is self-explanatory.  And it’ll be income tax for middle-income and lower-income people, but middle-income people because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality.  I’m saying that as a Republican, and you do have tax inequality.
So we’re going to be looking at income tax, and we’re going to be looking at capital gains tax cuts on both, and maybe substantial.  And we’ll be reporting back fairly shortly on that.  That’s big news.  That’s big news, but very important.  We want to have our jobs flourish.  We want to have our companies do great.  We want to have the 401(k)s, which are now at a level — if you look at the stock market, it’s great.
If you have stocks in NASDAQ, you’re higher than you ever were, including even — this is still during the pandemic.  The stock market — because they see such incredible things are happening, smart people — the stock market is that almost an all-time high.  We’re just short of it.  And NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/

August 7, 2020
7:34 P.M. EDT
    THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And it’s a great honor to have everybody here.  And I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend.  We have a terrific number of things, and some very positive things to tell you tonight. 
    I want to begin by giving an update on the economy.  Economic health is vital to public health.  That’s why our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school.  Very important. 
    We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May.  And I will say that the job growth that we’ve seen over the last three months — 9.3 million — is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history.  That’s big stuff.  That’s big news and great news. 
    Over the past three months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs.  Over the last three months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs.  Remember “You’d need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs”?  And we’re getting them even in a pandemic — which is disappearing; it’s going to disappear. 
    And 639,000 brand-new construction jobs.  Over half of the new jobs are fulltime jobs, and wages are up by 4.8 percent, which is terrific.  Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30 percent since April.  Think of that: 30 percent since April. 
    Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32 percent.  Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns — incredibly hard — increased by nearly 1 million over the past three months, and that’s also a record.  That’s a job record: African American, 1 million.  It’s job record.
    We must ensure that the progress continues.  My administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world.  So we’ve contributed $3 trillion.
    My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits; provide protections against evictions — the terrible thing happens with evictions.  Not fair.  It wasn’t their fault that we were infected with this disease from China.  And get relief to American families. 
    Yet, tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical leftwing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus.  Nothing to do with it at all.  So you have a virus that comes in, and you have people in Congress that don’t want to help our people. 
    If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act, under my authority as President, to get Americans the relief they need.  And what we’re talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months until the end of the year.  And I can extend it at a certain period.  Hopefully, I will be here to do the job.  We’re going to do the job; we’ve been doing the job like nobody could.  Nobody would, actually.  And so, we’re going to have the payroll tax go until the end of the year, and it’ll be retroactive to July 1st.  So we’re going to go back to July 1st, and it’ll go to the end of the year — payroll tax.  At the end of the year, it may be extended.
    We’re going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year.  So unemployment benefits will be — that’s a big one — will be brought out to the end of the year. 
    And defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice — so students who are paying student loans and, in many cases, they’re not even allowed to go back into their colleges.
    Extend the eviction moratorium — we will be extending that so people aren’t evicted.  Not their fault. 
    We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France, concerning numerus subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon.  Horrible, horrible event.
    At 3 p.m. this afternoon, I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft on the — are on the way, and they’re fully loaded — fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things, lots of emergency equipment.  Also first responders, technicians, doctors, and nurses are on their way.  This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time.  A horrible event.
    We’ll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world.  Everyone wants to help.  We spoke to a lot of people; they all want to help. 
    The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come.  We’re working very closely with their government and with their leaders.
    And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families — a much larger number of families than anybody would have thought and than anybody at first thought — but all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy.  We stand firmly with the people of Lebanon and will continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time.  We have not seen anything like this in a long time.
    As you know, earlier this week I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority who have been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority.  As you know, this is a form of utility.  It’s been around for a long time, since FDR. 
    And the head person — not controlled by government, but it’s sort of semi-public, in a sense — gets paid the highest salary in the world of government.  He gets $8 million a year.  That’s not a bad amount of money.  It’s $8 million a year.  And we are not accepting that.  Even though we’re not the ones that appoint him or her — but, in this case, him — we’re not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year.  This has been going on for many years.  And we will do something about that, and we’re already in negotiations right now, including possible termination. 
    They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers — the workers at TVA — were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this, and on top of the $8 million salary, and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year.  But, on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions — these incredible people — in order to train the lower-cost foreign workers imported to replace them.  How’s that for a law?  And this was set up, originally, to create jobs and economic development, and now they’re getting fired, and they’re supposed to train people for a much lower — who get a much lower salary.  It’s crazy.
    This was a grave injustice.  I fired the chairman of the board in response.  On Friday, I fired the chairman of the board, along with one other board member.  That’s the one thing we have; we have the right to fire board members.  And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the board members.  And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course, totally. 
    And today, I’m proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee and Kentucky and other areas that are covered — great states, great states — that the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back.  They’re being rehired as we speak.
    In this administration, we live by two rules: Buy American and hire American.  You can’t do that; you can’t fire all our workers and hire people back from other faraway parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people.  And they can never train them as good as what you have, because they’ve been there for many years.  They’ve done a fantastic job, and they love the TVA. 
    We had a lot of people in the office the other day — a lot of the media was covering it.  They love the Tennessee Valley Authority.  So — and they’re so proud to work for it.  But this happened and it was a terrible thing, so now they’re going to get their jobs back — they’re all going to be getting their jobs back.
    Nearly every nation on Earth continues to combat the virus.  A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe.  Cases continue to surge in Latin America.  That’s, right now, the most infected place anywhere in the world.  They have more than doubled in recent days.  Latin America is doing very little testing.  They’re not really equipped to do that.  It’s tough. 
    In the United States, more than 80 percent of jurisdictions report decline in cases.  We’re doing very well.  You don’t hear that too often from the media, but we’re doing very well.  We have a very large country — a very complex country, in a sense.  More than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week.  So, if you look at that, more than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week.  But we have to remain vigilant.  We’re doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.
    Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July.  The southern states that were very strong hotspots not long ago — Arizona, Texas, Florida — continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hos- — hospital beds. 
    Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus in-patients.  Since mid-June, it’s gone — the governor was up, and we had a great meeting — Governor Ducey.  And the meeting was terrific.  But since mid-June — so they’re doing well, and it’s going down — heading down very rapidly, actually.
    Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley, and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths.
    Florida is also stabilizing, and statewide positive test rate continues to decrease — from 13 percent on July 23rd, to 8 percent this week.  Florida has done very well.  It’s going down; it’s heading down, actually, quite rapidly.  And even Miami, which was the hottest spot in Florida, is heading downward.  But Florida has done very well.
    Texas has done very well, and rapidly.  And Arizona has done incredibly well.  So it — Arizona has really been a very rapid drop.
    New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1 percent of emergency room visits due to the China virus — the illness.  It took a devastating toll on both states, as you know.  While both states really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year, thankfully we have not seen a resurgence.  They’ve been doing a good job.  Everybody is working very hard.  Both governors are working very, very hard.  We’re in touch with them.  We’re supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed, if needed.  But they’re needing very little right now.  They’re in very good shape.  We will continue to monitor the new cases.
    Throughout this crisis, my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York, and to the people of every state — all of our states. 
    We’re carefully monitoring California’s Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. 
    We’re carefully watching regions from increasing cases, including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest.  We’re watching them all very carefully.  It’s vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable. 
    For this reason, we’ve delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America.  We’re focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems.  Diabetes is a big problem.  Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.  That’s an incredible number, when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. 
    And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes, and they are very, very vigilant.  They’re doing a very good job now.  They’ve really done something that I think is special.  They’re doing very well, in terms of the virus.  They’re working very hard.  And a lot of things happen — a lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard.  But the representatives of nursing homes — in some cases, the ownership of nursing homes — they’re working very hard.
    The federal government and the private sector have delivered more than 9 million N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns, and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone.  Think of that.  We provided $3.4 billion to the state of New Jersey in emergency relief funding.  So we happen to be in New Jersey right now, so those are great numbers.  The governor is working very hard; Governor Murphy is doing a good job.  We’re working very closely with him.  We’ve also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and healthcare facilities. 
    And through the Paycheck Protection Program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses.  A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well, they’re there because of what we did with Paycheck Protection.
    On therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials.  This would be years ahead of schedule.  We have done wonders with the FDA.  I want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn.  But we have phase three trials already going on, which is, most people would have said, impossible to even think about. 
    Today, Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead’s drug, remdesivir — where we’ve had tremendous success.
    Last week alone, my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients.  Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what’s going on.  And if you can go to a blood bank — if you’ve had this disease and — and beat it — and there are a lot of people that have — if you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help.
    The United States is only 5 percent of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25 percent of the world’s testing.  Think of that: 5 percent and we’ve given 25 percent of the world’s testing.  Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we’re constantly showing cases — cases, cases, cases are up.  Well, the reason cases are up, because we’re doing — one of the reasons — we’re doing a lot of testing. 
    We’re doing much more testing than anyone else.  Close to 65 million tests, where other countries have done very little testing.  They’ll test people if they get sick.  They’ll test people if they go into the hospital.  They’ll test certain people.  We’re doing tremendous testing.  And we’re especially doing big testing at the nursing homes. 
    Over the last week, the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pooling samples.  And we’ve also been able to send out many more of the tests, which are the 5-minute to 15-minute-result tests.  Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we’re very focused on and doing.  But in the not-too-distant future, we’ll have so many tests where it’s a quick test — they call it a “quick test” — 5 minutes to 15 minutes.  So we won’t even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving.  Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and, let’s say, a day at the laboratory — that’s three days right there.  And the other tests, you can have them in 5 to 15 minutes.
    Over the next two weeks, I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers.  That’s a big thing.  I’ve always been very strongly in favor — we have to cover pre-existing conditions.  So we will be pursuing a major executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all of its customers. 
    This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of. 
    This follows a series of executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices — and significantly.  We had the only year, which was last year, where drug prices went down in 51 years.  But we’re talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now, even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that’s usually a reason — they’re not happy.  They can’t be too thrilled.  But they’ve made a lot of money over the years, and prices just go up.  Not fair. 
    This includes a landmark executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans — and charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries.  So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries.  That means our country can’t be charged more. 
    So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price, and we’re paying many times that price in the United States — because we pay for all of the research, the development, the promotion, and other things — we will get what’s called a “favored-nations clause.”  We’re going to have — and I signed a favored-nations clause so that the United States — which is the number-one purchaser of drugs by far in the world — biggest purchaser in the world, not even close.  You have other countries that are bigger, if you look at India, China, et cetera.  Not too many.  But we have countries that are bigger, but not even close, in terms of ordering drugs.  We’re the number-one country in the world. 
    But we have a favored-nation — so if somebody has a — a drug — in many cases, it comes from a plant — the same plant.  It comes from — it’s the same pill; it’s the same medicine or medication.  Whatever the lowest country charges — so if Germany charges 10 cents for a pill, and we charge $2 — and I only use Germany as an example — then we get that — we get that for 10 cents.  So what’s going to happen is that’s going to go up a little bit, and ours is going to come down a whole lot.  So it’s the favored nations.
    And I will tell you that big pharma is not happy.  For too long, we’ve been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries.  We’ve subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe.  Nobody talked about it.  Everybody wondered, “How come every President that runs for office says they’re going to lower drug prices, and they never do?  They go through the right — roof.”  Over the last administration they went up, like, skyrocketing — skyrocketing.  That’s Biden.  Biden is not going to be able to be able to do it.  He has no clue. 
    So what’s happening is: We are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands.  And we’re going to give, essentially, all of the benefit that, frankly, they have as great negotiators — those benefits are going to go to our people.  So it’s called a “favored-nations clause,” and you can look it up, and you can see.  And nobody has had the courage to institute it, to call it because it’s a very big — it’s a very big step.  But it’s something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent.  We’re talking about numbers that are unbelievable. 
    I also signed an executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves.  These are some of the richest people in the world.  Everyone talked about middlemen.  I’ve heard about them for years, on prescription drug prices — middlemen.  I guess you’d have to say to be politically correct, “middlemen and women.”  But you never heard the “middlewomen” before; you heard “middlemen.”  That’s the term. 
    And, you know, say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product.  They produce the pill.  They produce the medicine — the medication.  But these people make billions and billions of dollars.  I don’t know who they are, but they’re very rich.  But they won’t be so rich anymore. 
    This executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients.  So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I’m going to lose a lot of friends, even though I have no idea who these people are. 
    AUDIENCE:  (Laughter.) 
    THE PRESIDENT:  On opioids, I’m pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America.  In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic.  And we’ve done very well.  We’ve done — it was prior to the virus — we were down 18, 19, and 20 percent.  But when you think about it, that means that you have 80 percent, and that’s not acceptable. 
    The wall is going up.  We have 276 miles of wall.  It’s having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already.  It’ll be finished toward the end of the year.  And it’s had a very, very big impact.
    On Portland: Finally, I’d like to address that situation.  Portland is a disaster.  It’s been a disaster for many, many years.  Brave federal law enforcement officers singlehandedly — the officers, they singlehandedly saved the federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists — and that’s what they are.  You know, when you find Molotov cocktails in somebody’s knapsack, and they say, “No, I’m just here to have a good time.”  (Laughter.)  These are really sick, disturbed people.
    The disgraced mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob.  He was at the mercy of the mob, too.  If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible.  He went out there and they wanted to rip him apart.  But, fortunately, he had five people with him called “security.”
    Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob.  As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down — an act of attempted murder.  Leftwing, violent extremism poses an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it.  You have no idea how much we stop, but it’s an ideology we have to stop.
    “When you commit arson…” — this is a quote from the mayor; he’s come a long way.  He just made this quote.  “When you commit arson with an accelerant in [the] attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who…have intentionally [been] trapped inside, you are not a” demonstrator — or “you’re not demonstrating,” said, Mayor 2722, “You are attempting to commit murder.”  That’s come a long way; he’s come a long way when he made that statement. 
    What you’re seeing in Portland is the radical left’s agenda in action.  Portland is their roadmap for America.  If the radical left gets in — and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet; he’s merely a puppet.  But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want.  That’s what they want.  Why?  Who knows?  Doesn’t matter.  It’s a different thinking, but it’s a mess. 
    And I want to thank Homeland Security.  They’ve done a fantastic job.  We had our people go in.  They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse, and the courthouse was saved, and other federal buildings were saved.  And we would like to be asked by the mayor and the governor — we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours, just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city.  But the National Guard went in, did a phenomenal job. 
    It was over in three hours.  After watching six days of horror, it ended in three hours.  You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street, just to — it was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things. 
    So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately, but we are supposed to be asked.  If we’re not asked and if it continues, we’ll have to make a decision.  But it’s a very easy thing for us to do.  We could stop it very quickly.  It’s been going on now for 76 days.  But our buildings are very secure.
    If the Democrats controlled in Washington — the Democrats’ control of Washington — they’d pass — with all of the things they do — legislation gutting every single police department in America.  They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department.  At a minimum, they’re to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department.
    No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe.  Your suburbs would be a disaster.  Your cities, your towns would be a disaster.  They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we’re waiting for the mayor.  We’ve sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we’re waiting for them to call — the governor, the mayor.  We could do a very good job in Chicago.  Nobody’s ever seen anything like that — this country. 
    And yet, nationwide numbers are good, despite the Chicagos and the Portlands — and, frankly, the New Yorks, when you look at what’s happened in New York.  Three hundred and forty-eight percent increase in the last number of months.  Nobody has seen anything like that.  It’s so sad.  To me, it’s so sad because I love New York.  And it’s so sad.  And it — all it is, is horrible, horrible incompetent management by politicians that truly don’t know what they’re doing.
    So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America.  And a vast majority of people agree with me.  A vast majority.  Most people.  They don’t speak up as much as they could, but we know they’re there, and everybody else knows they’re there, too. 
    So, with that, I’ll take a few questions from the media.  They’ve been here for a long time, and they’ve been waiting outside for a long time.  And they wait for these moments.  So it was a lot of fun.  (Laughter.)
    Please, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-bedminster-nj/

6:07 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Let me begin by sending America’s deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed, hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut.  Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families.  The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon.  I have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon, and we will be there to help.  It looks like a terrible attack.
     I also want to provide the latest on Tropical Storm Isaias.  Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East Coast, and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible.  I spoke to Governor Cooper, I spoke to Governor DeSantis, and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA, and they’re working very hard.
     Coastal areas in the storm’s path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents, while inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds.  FEMA is responding to states that have requested the assistance.  We have a list of those states; we can give them to you in a little while.  And my administration is monitoring the situation very closely.
     We have the military on guard, but we have — FEMA is there, in all cases.  The Corps of Engineers is ready if needed — the Army Corps of Engineers.  Very talented people.  I urge everyone in the storm’s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities.
     I now want to update you on the path forward, having to do with the China virus.  Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers, which are rather spectacular, that just came out.  The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management — that’s “ISM”; most of you know it by “ISM” — increased for the third month in a row, rising nearly 2 points in July to 54.2 — that’s fantastic — the highest reading since March of 2019. 
     This is remarkable, considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest, in particular, virus hotspots.  The ISM measures — and it’s a very strong measure of new orders.  It rose 5 points in July, to 61.5, in its highest rating, that would be, since September of 2018.  That’s a big number. 
     Since the April low, new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM, dating back all the way to 1948.  So, 34 points — that’s the largest since 1948. 
     Similarly, the ISM’s measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest 3-month gain in over 70 years.  That’s some — some number.
These were somewhat surprising, but I’ve been saying we’re doing well, and those numbers are really spectacular. 
     Automobile sales, likewise, are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up, stunningly.  It’s a 65 percent increase since then, to 14.5 million units, which is a — a massive number. 
     The great strength and great news is really for states like — in particular, Michigan; and Ohio; South Carolina; Pennsylvania, very good; Florida, little bit.  These are great numbers.  Record-setting numbers. 
     The strength in new car sales is also evident in the used car market, where soaring demand — literally, soaring demand — is putting upward pressure on the used car prices.  This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry.  The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector — and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers.  We’re very, very happy with these numbers.  And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers, in a very positive way.
     Economy-wide inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter.  A crash, in that case, means a good thing, not a bad thing.  That’s the largest drop ever on record — ever. 
     Homebuilder sentiment, likewise, is soaring, as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year.  And new homes recently made a 13-year high.  So we have a 13-year high in new home — new home construction. 
     New business applications are very strong.  That just came out.  The widely followed Atlanta Fed GDP — and it’s something that they have just come out with — now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates.  It looks like it’s showing a 20 percent annualized growth in the current quarter.  So 20 percent in the current quarter; we’ll take that all day long.  I — let’s see if that’s right.  That’s a projection.  So we’ll see if that’s right.  The Atlanta Fed — very respected. 
     The virus — back to that — we are continuing to monitor and monitor, in particular, hotspots across the South, Southwest, and the West.  And we’re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well, actually, especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for — ever since we’ve gotten to understand this horrible, horrible plague that’s been unleashed on our country by China.
     As of yesterday, cases are declining in 70 percent of the jurisdictions, compared to 36 percent last Monday.  That’s a big, big number.  Eleven out of thirteen states with the positive rate above 10 percent have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July.  In other states, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always is strong, even though the numbers are getting very good — states that have a test positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent.  And in the states with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. 
     We must ensure that these states do not become new flare-ups, so we’re watching them very, very closely.  Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths.
     Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak.  So the death — the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level.  One is too much — one death — because this should have never happened to us.  It should have been stopped at — very easily, by China, in Wuhan.  
     Thanks to our major advances in treatment, we’ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups.  Compared to April, mortality rates are 85 percent lower among individuals aged 18 to 69, and 70 percent lower among individuals over 70 years old.
     We’ve also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly.  Approximately 85 percent of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65 — just getting some very accurate numbers on this.  And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications.
     Since the pandemic began, nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted-living centers.  That’s an incredible statistic, when you hear that number.  This data, underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk.
     As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly, and we’re doing that.  We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense.  And those with underlining [sic] conditions, especially the elderly with the underlining [sic] — whether it’s heart or diabetes — they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems.  While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school.
     Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately, and that’s what we’re doing.  This is the science-based approach, and it’s good with us.  Working very hard on that.  An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest-risk populations, while inflicting massive economic pain, long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. 
     So there won’t be lockdowns, but we watch specific areas.  We’re very careful and we’re putting out embers.  We’re putting out flames.  When you look at what’s happening with Miami, and it’s going — the numbers are going down.  But Florida is going down very significantly.  Texas and California are going down rather significantly.
     On telemedicine, as we discussed the last time, as — and as I said numerous times during this day, it’s an incredible thing that’s happening.  A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth, so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes.  And that’s what’s happening.  The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million — so from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week.  In total, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began.  That’s a tremendous thing that’s happened with telehealth.
     As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines.  Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials, with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks.  And you’ve read and seen what’s happened today.  Today’s news was very exciting. 
     Through Operation Warp Speed, we’re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we’re determined to have a vaccine very quickly.  We think we’re going to have something very soon. 
     We have great companies.  These are the — among the greatest companies in the world.  But right now, they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices — prescription drug prices — very massively.  Some of these companies are involved in that; some of them aren’t.  We’re having a tremendous — you’ll see a tremendous drop in price.  We’re using favored nations — we’re using the rebates.  We’re using everything. 
     For so long, I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are.  They call them “the middlemen.”  And they are very wealthy.  Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people. 
     And we’re doing the rebates.  We’re doing purchases from other countries — like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to, under a very bad system.  I don’t call it “archaic”; I call it “bad” because it’s meant, really, for drug companies to get higher prices.
     But under — under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is $2, we’re allowed to say we want favored nations, and we want the pill for the same — the same as the lowest country in the world.  If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that’s the price we’re going to get.  Drug companies aren’t too happy about that — big pharma.
     We’ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness.  Today, the NIH — we’re — very exciting — announced that they’re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country.  We’re going to move — move very quickly.  Results look very good already.  Incredible results. 
     More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway, and we’ve secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir — of remdesivir.  We’re really doing a job with it, and it’s helping a lot of people.  That’s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good — relatively speaking, that is.  But that’s for American hospitals through the month of September.  So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September.  That’s big news.
     The United States also has far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world.  Testing has been incredible, what we’ve been able to do.  Nobody is even close.  Since March 12th, we’ve increased daily testing by 32,000 percent.  How’s that?  Thirty-two thousand percent.  Somebody would say, “That must be a typo.”  It’s not a typo.  Thirty-two thousand percent. 
     We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide, averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week.  And now that we’re understanding the virus, we’re understanding very much what we’re doing with respect to who it affects, who it’s destroying, and who gets away with it — like young people, very young people.  We’ll be having some interesting statements having to do a testing and focus testing.  I call it “focus testing.”
     By comparison, Mexico — so we’re doing numbers that are incredible.  But by comparison, Mexico — as you know, the President was here; he’s a great guy — but their — their numbers are much different.  They do about 1 million tests.  France has done 2.9 million tests.  Canada is around the 4 million mark.  Australia is around the 4 million mark.  The United States is testing more people in a single week than, in many cases, large segments or large, well-known countries all put together.  It’s been an amazing achievement: the testing and the quality of the testing also.  And now we’re doing testing where you can have results in 5 minutes, in 7 minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting to come back from labs — for it to come back from labs.
     Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Phoenix; Miami; Jacksonville, Florida; McAllen, Texas; Bakersfield, California.  And this week, we’re opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas; Atlanta.  To date, more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites. 
     Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual’s blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. 
     FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than — we have new numbers — more than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls, and 21 billion gloves — billion.  Can you believe that?  Billion gloves.
     And we distribute that to the governors, different states.  And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy, that I can tell you.  No — no complaints from any of them.  They’re very, very happy.  What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done.
     In our National Stockpile, we’ve tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million; tripled the number of gowns to 15 million; and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000.  These numbers are growing every day, and we’re now making thousands of ventilators — many thousands of ventilators a month.  And we’re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators.  They’re very hard to produce.  They’re very complicated machines.  So we’re — we’re fully stocked here, and we’ve made sure that every state is fully stocked, but we’re getting them to a lot of countries that need help.
     We’ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine.  I’m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. 
     And I want to thank you all for being here.  We’ll take a few questions.
     Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-4-2020/

1:04 P.M.  EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  Hello.  Sorry to keep you all waiting.  Before I begin, it is day 42 of the botched New York City primary, where still there is no election results in one congressional race.  This, as the New York Times notes, is due to, quote, “the deluge of 400,000 mail-in ballots,” previewing the, quote, “challenges facing the nation as it looks towards conducting the November general election with mass mail-in voting.” 
     Now I’d like to highlight the Trump administration’s actions on telehealth, which the President detailed yesterday.  The President signed an executive order to make regulatory reforms, allowing for greater access to telehealth and toward making it permanent. 
     The Trump administration has cut red tape, allowing telehealth services for seniors and for other Americans.  Thirty-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries took advantage of the President’s reform, seeking telehealth services over the phone rather than through video conference.  A simpler and a smarter way to go about things is now available to Medicare beneficiaries. 
     The President also took executive action to boost rural healthcare services.  According to a 2019 study by Navigant, rural hospitals would be devastated by Medicare for All, otherwise known as government takeover of healthcare.  And under that analysis, they found that if Democrats had their way, 55 percent of rural hospitals or 1,037 hospitals across 46 states would be at high risk of closure. 
     The President’s executive order calls for strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure, which will expand telemedicine and rural broadband access.  Democrats seek to deny Americans their healthcare freedom, but President Trump is working hard to save your healthcare by guaranteeing protections for people with preexisting conditions, eliminating the highly unpopular individual mandate of Obamacare, stopping surprise medical billing, increasing transparency, and lowering drug prices. 
     President Trump will continue to work hard to enact these healthcare principles by requiring price transparency; allowing states to purchase drugs from other countries; and improving Medicare to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs for seniors; and by ending surprise medical billing, and making companies compete for your business by providing more options and more affordable plans. 
     Lastly, later today, Advisor to the President, Ivanka — Senior Advisor to the President, Ivanka Trump, will be joined by Attorney General Barr; Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Brooke Rollins; executives from organizations that combat human trafficking; and survivors from across the country for a roundtable to highlight newly awarded Department of Justice grants to provide safe, stable housing to survivors of human trafficking.
     DOJ will award over $35 million in Housing Assistance Grants for victims of human trafficking to provide supportive housing and appropriate services to survivors of human trafficking. 
     And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-4-2020/

5:36 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT:  I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias.  It’s a very interesting name.  last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve issued emergency declarations to support a response in both of those areas.  So that’s Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
     This week, the storm passed just east of Florida.  Got a little bit lucky.  Didn’t hit Florida too hard.  Working with the governor, working with everybody.  But it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might.
     It’s currently off the coast of South Carolina, heading northward to North Carolina.  It’s expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a category 1 hurricane.  Very serious.  A lot of water.  A lot of water coming from that storm. 
     I’ve already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina.  And FEMA’S personnel — and they are great; they’re doing a job — they’re already on the ground in all areas.  Every single area that we mentioned is covered.
     Over the next several days, there’s expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey.  We’re working with each of those states, and in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement — all of the different groups that are involved.  Storm surge and inland flooding are possible, and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes.
     I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities.  We’re working with them.  And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far.  So stay safe.
     Next, let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus.  We’re beginning to see evidence of significant progress.  Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6 percent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 to 8 percent over that same period of time, an encouraging sign — very encouraging, I have to add — that the virus is receding.
     In hotspots across the South and West, we’ve seen slow improvements.  From their recent weekly peaks, Arizona’s weekly case counts have dropped 37 percent.  That’s a tremendous drop.  And the governor and the state have done a fantastic job.  Down 37 percent.  Texas down 18.7 percent.  I was there a couple of days ago.  And Florida, 21.2 percent drop.  So that’s a tremendous job that they’re all doing.
     As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare-ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri.  And I think you’ll find that they’re soon going to be very much under control.
     Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates.  Under 5 percent: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  It’s under five.
     Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful, in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those states.
     To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance; wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places; and to protect the elderly.  Very, very important — protect the elderly.  It’s much different.  Young children have very strong immune systems.  We’ve learned how strong they are.  But protect the elderly.  The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old.  That’s the average age.
     It’s important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward, and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent.
     As we’re seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging — you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough, invisible enemy — lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future.  They just don’t.  It comes back.  Many times, it comes back.  The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially as it respects to — with respect to hospitals; learn more about the disease; and develop effective treatments, as we did in the United States.  We’re doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics.
     Countries where there have been very significant flare-ups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan.  And also, as you probably heard, in Hong Kong, they’ve had some very serious flare-ups.  Japan has gone — yeah, a lot — a lot of six-fold — six-fold flare-up.  That’s a lot.  But they’ll get it under control.
     In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school, with careful precautions.  Ideally, we want to open those schools.  We want to open them. 
     At the same time, we’re placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment, and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine.  The vaccines are coming along incredibly well.
     Today I’d like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we’ve done.  We’re taking — really taking an increased interest, and we’re seeing numbers that nobody can even believe, in terms of percentage increase.  It’s telehealth for American patients.  The — the percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it’s very, very significant; numbers that you would not even think possible.
     This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA healthcare team.  And it worked out really well.  We have a 91 percent approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we’re doing.  This is the first — it’s the highest ever recorded.
     Now telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA, and it’s becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens.  You don’t have to go to the doctor’s office; you don’t have to go to hospitals. 
     When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience.  And really, they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes.
     Today I’m taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay.  Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent.  We’ve done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we’re doing on medicine and medical and what we’re doing.  They can do things that you wouldn’t believe, that even a year ago, two years ago would not have been doable.
     We’re enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient.  And very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you.
     The order builds upon a series of actions we’ve all taken to make telehealth available to all.  We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost.  That’s no additional cost.  And co-payments can be waived for telehealth services.
     We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices.  And I will tell you that the favored nations clause that I’ve signed into existence — nobody thought anybody would ever do that — has a massive impact on prescription drug prices, in addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, in particular prescription drugs. 
     But the favored nations clause is massive.  For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 10 cents a pill, as an example — just as an example — and the United States pays 2 dollars for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right as they do.  We never had that before.  We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development.  So the — the numbers are astronomical.  And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by big pharma.  Very big ads.  Very massive buy. 
     But in the meantime, they’re calling.  They want to know if they can make a deal.  And I say to people, “The only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you.”  And they understand that.  I think our people understand that. 
     But, in particular, when you look at the matching — you could call it “matching” or you could call it “favored nations” — call it whatever you like — it’s a tremendous — it’s going to have a tremendous — and I’m talking about 50, 60 percent, 70 percent.  That doesn’t mean it goes to 10 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up and ours goes down.  And you have many, many countries where their numbers — the numbers are so low.  I mean, so low.  And by that, I mean, much lower than the United States.
     Another thing I’m doing is if a certain country, like Canada — Canada buys for very much less than the United States has bought.  How they allowed this to happen — representatives of our country standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office — how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible. 
     We’ve been working on this for a long time.  I’ve been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right?  So now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida — who is doing a great job — or our great governor of Ohio or a great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50 percent less.  So we’ll be buying from Canada.
     Now, what the drug companies are going to do — maybe they’ll raise them, maybe they’ll lower them, or maybe they’ll just give up and sell them to us directly much cheaper.  So a lot of things are happening.
     Also, the rebate — we have people that are very wealthy that nobody ever heard of them.  Nobody knows who they are.  I guess, in some cases, they can be pharmacies; in some cases, they’re individuals.  We’re doing a rebate, and the rebate goes to the people.  It lowers the price of drugs.
     So we have a series of four things that we signed.  And you will see, over a period — a fairly short period — drug prices are going to be tumbling down at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible.
     We have — in 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration.  It was last year.  Fifty-one years it went up.  But that was just a small decline.  This is a massive decline.  This is a decline that nobody can believe.  I was called by senators, I was called by congressmen: “Please don’t do this.”  But big pharma doesn’t mean anything to me other than we want them to do a great job.  We want them to get their vaccines.  We want them to do what has to be done. 
     So I think you’re going to see drug price reductions over the next four or five or six months — it’ll probably take a little while to kick in — that are going to be at numbers that you wouldn’t believe.  But in the meantime — they called on Friday afternoon — they want to meet and see if they do something else.  They don’t like favored nations clauses.  I understand that.
     We vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services — through telehealth, by the way — including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority.  We brought the substance abuse — at least prior to the China plague, or whatever you want to call it — we brought it down very substantially.  Pediatric critical care and much more. 
     Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services.  So a very, very big priority on telehealth.  As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help healthcare providers and hospitals expand their telehealth.  And they’re all doing it.  They’re doing it gladly.
     Prior to the epidemic or the pandemic — whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it — but prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn’t anything raging.  And I guess one of the only good things that we’ve gotten out of this whole horrible situation is telehealth has been incredible.  And again, the increases are, you know, many hundreds of times greater than it was before.  Do you have a number?  It’s like 2,000 percent or something like that.  It’s an incredible — it’s an incredible increase.  You’ll get the number.  But it’s — it’s — I think they have it now finally, and it’s really an incredible — thank you, Kayleigh. 
     We worked with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus.  We cut red tape to allow many services to be conducted by phone, rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. Thirty-five percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone.  So you’re talking about 6-point — 3.6 million seniors.  That’s something.  10.1 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic.  So you’re talking there 10.1 million people.
     In April, over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than 0.1 percent in February.  Those are part of the numbers that I think — I’ll have you get them.  So this part, you don’t have to; you’ll get the other — the other section.  Thank you.
     So think of that: compared to less than 0.1 percent — 0.1 percent.  That’s an incredible number.  So over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to — so you went from 0.1 percent to 43 percent.  That’s an incredible — that’s an incredible number.
     The executive order I signed today will also expand healthcare access in rural America.  We take care of rural America.  It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure.  And we’re working very hard with all of the people in government that are involved with the communications infrastructure so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access. 
     Additionally, revenue for rural providers vary significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business.  Many, many are having a very difficult time.  To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility — really, great flexibility — and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients.
     Furthermore, I’m directing the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission — we were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium — to form a task force that will break down barriers to expanding rural healthcare.  This order continues my administration’s focus on rural healthcare. 
     We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas.  We allocated another $10 billion to 2,000 rural hospitals, and more than 2,400 rural health clinics.  We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time — and these are people that had great reputations and great track records — for practitioners that serve on the frontlines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients.
     We’re also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the state and local areas have the supplies they need.  We’ve been supplying hospitals and cities and states, governors — helping governors at a number that nobody has ever heard of before.  Fifteen thousand four hundred and forty nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment.  They’re very much stocked up; they’re in great shape.  They all have the ventilators — all the ventilators they need.  They have, actually, more than they need.  And their equipment — medical equipment is in very, very good shape.  They’re full.
     My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves, and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide.  We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we’ve been talking about together on vaccines and treatments. 
     Under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting — most exciting — last week, we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients.  Had great results.  This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia.  And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along.
     Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late-stage illness.  They’ve been very good.  We’re also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies, and that, we’re working on.  And that’s a brilliant art.  It’s really an art.  And we launched a national plasma drive last week — I was at the Red Cross building — with the American Red Cross and 13 other healthcare organizations.
     I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to Coronavirus.gov — Coronavirus.gov — and donate plasma today.  We would really appreciate it.  This really makes people better.  But we need — what we need is we need that beautiful ingredient that you, that got better, seem to have in your — in your veins.  You have to go to Coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today.  It’ll be tremendous.  We really appreciate it if you do it, because we’re low.  We’re low.  We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing.  It’ll take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative.  Makes people better.  And, you know, you had something very special.  You had something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to use it.  So whatever you can do.  Coronavirus.gov.
     As a result of improvements we’ve made in treatment, for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85 percent from its April peak.  Eighty-five percent decline. 
     On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK] to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine.  One hundred million doses.  This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting.  We’re supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, who are having wonderful results, and they’re in final stages of testing. 
     There are now two vaccines in the — in that final stage of clinical trials in America, with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately.  And we have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies.  These are great companies.  These are companies that are not only well known, they’re well respected, most importantly.
     We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year.  And we’re mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we’re ready immediately upon approval.  We have our military lined up.  It’s logistics; it’s all about logistics.  They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers.  But now they’ll be doing vaccine.  Our general is all ready to go and he’s very excited.  And once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he’ll start the process.  They will start the process, and they’ll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond, if it works as we think it probably will.
     By unleashing America’s technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic and we will hopefully end it very quickly.  The therapeutics are very exciting to me — where you can go into a hospital, and whether it’s through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody and they get better.  That’s something, to me, that’s very important.  And we’re doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines. 
     So thank you all very much for being here.  We’ll take a couple of questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-3-2020/

10:54 A.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: Good morning, everyone. We’re going to begin with some brief remarks from Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and he’ll be giving you all an update on phase four negotiations.
MR. MEADOWS: Good morning. As you know, over the last several days, we’ve been having conversations on Capitol Hill, Secretary Mnuchin and myself, with Democrat and Republican leaders, both in the House and the Senate.
Last night, we concluded a meeting with Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi a little bit before 10 o’clock, and at the President’s direction, we have made no less than four different offers to Democrats on Capitol Hill on how we can make sure that the enhanced unemployment that is set to expire today, along with eviction protection that is set to expire as well, is protected. And those four different offers have been actually rejected, but more importantly than that, they’ve not even been countered with a proposal.
So the Democrats are certainly willing, today, to allow some of the American citizens who are struggling the most under this pandemic to go unprotected. And the President has been very clear for us to be aggressive and forward leaning to make sure that they get protected. And yet, what we’re seeing is politics as usual from Democrats up on Capitol Hill.
It surprises me that when we talk about compassion and caring about those that — that truly are in need, that a temporary solution to make sure that unemployment — enhanced unemployment continues has been rejected not once but multiple times.
The Democrats believe that they have all the cards on their side, and they’re willing to play those cards at the expense of those that are hurting. And we’ll continue on with additional discussions today with Senator Schumer and Senator — and Speaker Pelosi, perhaps an in-person meeting tomorrow on Capitol Hill, as we — we stay engaged.
But I’m — I’m disappointed. And what we’ve — what we’ve experienced over the last three days — and I want to stress that the Democrats have made zero offers over the last three days. Zero. And so, in a spirit of compromise, the President has sent us back not once, not twice, but three different times to try to find some common ground. And what we found from our Democrat negotiators is that they are bumping the price higher than the very bill that they passed out of the House several weeks ago.
And to give you a particular example of that is: In their HEROES bill, they have $100 billion for schools. We matched that offer and actually put forth a proposal for $105 billion for schools for K-through-12 and higher institutions. And yet, what did they say to that? “Oh, no, that was two months ago. We want to increase the amount of money that we send to schools to $400 billion.” We’re going in the wrong direction. They’re going in the wrong direction because of partisan politics. It is very disappointing.
And so we call on Capitol Hill to get serious about their negotiations. The President is serious about the negotiations. We’re willing to engage.
As you know, Leader McConnell, yesterday, put forth a one-week extension at the current level for enhanced unemployment. And what did we see? Senator Schumer objected to that. So there’s no clear message that the American people should receive, other than the fact that the Democrats are willing to pay — play politics at a critical time in our nation’s very dire circumstances as we deal with this pandemic.
So I wanted to give you that brief update so that you can have it straight from the negotiations, as they’ve happened over the last three days, and as we work.
I’m going to — I’m going to turn it over to — to the Press Secretary. And I think she’s prepared to answer all the questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-31-2020/

5:41 P.M. EDT
     THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.  Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain.  He was a very special person.  I got to know him very well.  And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus.  And we send our prayers to Herman’s great wife, Gloria.  Wonderful family. 
     And I have to say, America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy.  We mourn their loss, as a nation; we mourn their loss, as people — as people that love one another.  And we’re working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague — it’s what it is, is a plague — but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines.  And we’re making a lot of strides. 
     All over the world, they’re having tremendous problems.  A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well.  Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet — in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong — places where they thought it was — they had really done great.  It came back.  And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly. 
     The virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again.  So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that; you have to hold your statement. 
     Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times — that’s 35 times — in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few.  These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised.  Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections.  And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers — you have no idea what they might be.  And I can say “scarcity of testing.”  Almost anywhere, except for our country. 
     This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border states.  Meanwhile, states like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others — they were thought to be doing well, and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard. 
     And governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore.  They were held up as models to follow, and then they got hit and — now, I’m not even saying this is their fault.  It’s probably not their fault.  It’s just the way it is.  That’s the way it is.  Highly infectious — one of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen.  Not since 1917, over 100 years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we’re witnessing now. 
     But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound.  And, again, no one is immune.  No one is immune.  These facts illustrate the imposing determinant — and it is a determinant — that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country.  People are starting to understand the disease now.  We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn’t have any idea.  We didn’t — nobody ever saw anything like this. 
     The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity, and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality.  And we’ve done that.  But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it. 
     We did the right thing initially.  We saved millions of lives, what we did.  We did the right thing.  But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all.  A small shutdown of certain areas — but we don’t want to do that — small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time. 
     We understand what we’re dealing with now, but it’s a very complex situation.  And I can only say: Thank Heaven that we — that we are so advanced in what we’re doing, in terms of vaccines and therapies. 
     We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets.  Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population.  Think of it: Half of the deaths — really, a tremendous number — half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population, those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  The average age of those who die from the illness is 78. 
     We’ve announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable.  The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions. 
     I’m once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who’s elderly — especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses.  Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we’re discussing.  But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance, wear a mask if you cannot socially distance, and practice vigorous hygiene.
     Everyone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease.  The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected. 
     In the current hotspots across the Sun Belt, the data is showing very encouraging signs.  Arizona, in particular, has crossed an important threshold.  For every person with the virus, we’re now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected.  And the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially.  They’re starting to come down in Florida.  Arizona is really leading the way. 
     I was in Texas yesterday, and they’re starting to come down significantly, we believe, in Texas.  Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they’re coming down very significantly. 
     Earlier today, I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy — which is a tremendous — a tremendous thing that they’re looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it — potentially lifesaving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease. 
     More than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus, and today we’re asking them to visit Coronavirus.gov — Coronavirus.gov — and volunteer to donate plasma.  We need plasma.  It’s something that’s been very effective, and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do.  Most people do. 
     Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating.  We’ve secured over 90 percent of the world’s supply of remdesivir — which is terrific — an encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. 
     We’ve also approved the use of the widely-available steroid — which has been very successful — dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. 
     On July 17th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials — moving along very rapidly.  That’s Regeneron. 
     As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was just in April.  So in a very short period of time.  Think of that: Just 18 — 85 percent lower than it was in April.  It’s a big statement. 
     Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill.  Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers.  We love our American workers.  And we’ve set records on job creation — records — two months in a row. 
     We enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package.  The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs.  We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans.  We approved $500 billion for our hardest-hit industries — $500 billion. 
     We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties.  It was a big thing, a very big thing. 
     We also suspended student loan payments for six months, and we’re looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time. 
     As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record 7 million jobs in the two months past alone. 
     To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will — we had a great foundation to build on.  We were the strongest country in the world; nobody close.  We were outdoing everybody from China.  If you remember, for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States.  Well, it didn’t.  We gained on them very significantly.  We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen — 2019, and we’ll be back there very shortly.  It won’t take very long, based on everything that we’re seeing.  It’s not going to take very long.  I think next year is going to be an excellent year — maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint. 
     We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost, and we never will.  We’ll never forget them; never forget what happened.  This could have been stopped in China.  They should have stopped it, and they didn’t.
     But I’m asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need.  First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits.  This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.  This was not anybody’s fault.  From the standpoint of jobs, it happened — a terrible thing happened.  Could’ve been stopped.  It happened.
     I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today — in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I’m surprised at — because this is great for our country and it’s great for our workers, and it wasn’t our workers’ fault.  
     Second, we’re asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions.  We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments.  We don’t want that to happen.
     Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program.  This money will help millions of hardworking families get by.
     My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen.  Children are not [sic] at the lowest risk.  If you look at what’s going on: the younger, the better.  Amazing — the immune system.  For children, the lower they are in age, the lower the risk, in terms of the age group itself. 
     I tell the story that, in New Jersey, with thousands and thousands of people dying — sadly, dying — the governor was telling me that only one — Phil Murphy — only one died under the age of 18.  That’s incredible.  Where thousands of people that died in the state of New Jersey, one made an impact; one died under the age of 18.
     Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus.  Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our nation’s children.  We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family.  We have to remember that there’s another side to this: Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also.  Economic harm, but it’s causing death for different reasons.  But death — probably more death.
     If governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice.  So we say if a school doesn’t want to open or if a governor doesn’t want to open — maybe for a political reason and maybe not, but there is some of that going on — the money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. 
     If schools stay closed, the money should follow the students so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters — about their children.
     But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party.  They have tremendous voices.  They’re looking at November 3rd.  And probably a day later, they’ll say, “Let’s open up the country.” 
     But the Democrats have to reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it’s going right now.  We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of states that you thought were doing pretty poorly, from the standpoint of the virus, and they’re actually coming back very strong. 
     This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first.  I got elected on the fact that I put America first. 
     For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last.  If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we’ve watched for many years destroy our country — NAFTA, we terminated it.  We have USMCA now, which is a great deal, and our farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic.  But we put America first, America’s families first, and America’s workers first.
     But that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future.  We’ve cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations.  And we’ve cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country.
     Americans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. 
     So I just want to thank you all.  And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. 
     Steve, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-july-30-2020/

5:20 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Today my administration has taken a momentous step toward achieving American pharmaceutical independence — a very, very big, big step — a focus of our campaign to bring America’s critical supply chains and medical manufacturing back to the USA.  We’ve been working on this for a long time.
This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus.  It should have never happened.  It should have never been here.  They should have stopped it.
In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States.  Millions of jobs were vacuumed out — just taken out so easily.  Our politicians let that happen.  And our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases, to China and all over the world — countries all over the world.
Nearly four years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home where they belong.  When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security.  We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America’s medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs.
I just want to say that Pfizer just announced, a little while ago, that they’re combining phase two and phase three trials, and the vaccine looks like it’s really heading in a very rapid direction, in a very positive direction.  First time that’s happened.  And they’re many months ahead of any other trial.  There’s never been anything like it.  So it’s the fastest ever, and to me, it’s very exciting.
Today, I’m proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries.  My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company — you remember this company; it’s called — from the good, old camera age, the old days — to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients.  It’s called Kodak.  And it’s going to be right here in America.
So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak.  They’ve been working very hard.  Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now — Rochester, New York — a good place.  And they’re trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal, and they will be announcing this deal.
I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives.  We’ve worked really well together on this deal.  It’s a big deal.  It’s going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak.
Ninety percent of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs.  We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration, by far.  Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less.
Yet, in less than 10 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs — they’re currently manufactured in America — more than 50 percent, however, are made in India and China.  And you’ll be seeing — a lot of things have happened.  It’s been happening, but it’s happening at a more rapid pace right now.
With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals.  It’s a great name, when you think of it.  Such a great name.  It was one of the great brands in the world.  Then people went digital, and Kodak didn’t follow.  But now, under very extraordinary leadership, they are following and they’re doing something that’s a different field, and it’s a field that they’ve really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company — watching over it.  But it’s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States.
Under this contract, our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act — remember when you were saying I didn’t use it enough, I didn’t use it enough?  And now you heard it’s the 33rd use.  We don’t talk about it all the time; we used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren’t doing as we were asking them to do, and it came through as both a threat and a usage.  But this is our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act.
Kodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal.  Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe.  We’ll be competitive with almost all countries, and soon with all countries.
Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we’ve opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25 percent of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the USA.  That’s a big number: 25 percent.
This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak’s factory in Rochester; that’s just in the initial phase.  And in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well and it’s a great place — and I’m very happy that we’re able to help them with the problems that they’ve had recently.  And the National Guard — I want to thank the National Guard, both state and beyond.  I want to thank them for the incredible job.  They went in and they did some beautiful job.  They cleaned it up.  You didn’t hear about the problems anymore.
And indirectly, I want to create — we created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains.  We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain — not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also.  I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible.
Today’s action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history.  We’ll be able to do that.
Through the Defense Production Act and other authorities, we have invested more than $3 billion in our nation’s industrial base.  We’ve contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year — nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year.
We’ve contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase U.S. production of N95 masks.  And we’ve brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we’ll have 160 million in a very short while — 160 million a month.  That’s many times what we used to do.  If you go back two years ago, it’s many, many times.
We’re increasing domestic production of gloves by 1,000 percent.  It’s 1,000 percent.  We will be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year.
We’re finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric.  We have 13 million reusable gowns in the Stockpile, and we’ll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed.
We made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests.  So we have — there’s nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max.  And we’re already at about a 50 percent level, and we’re bringing it up very substantially from there.
We’re growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month.  There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close.
Through our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing and the state of Maine — a great state — we’ve increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now.  As you remember, I went to Maine; I went to the plant where they do this.  It was incredible.  It was a great experience.  And we’ll produce over 100 million swabs per month by January.
We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter.  So we’ll have 500 million doses.  And, logistically, we’re using our military, our great military — a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations — and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly.  They’re all mobilized.  It’s been fully set up.
A very, very talented general is in charge.  And when we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of.  It’ll be a very — a very rapid process all over the country.  And perhaps we’ll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we, all of a sudden, have become very good at making.
When the China virus struck our nation, we mobilized the entire government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies.  HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns.  That’s a lot of gowns.
Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States.  Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens.  As you know, that’s where we want to take care — we have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem — in particular, heart or diabetes.  Which provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million mask — masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns.
We have replenished the long-neglected National Stockpile.  In January, the Stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks.  Today, the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we’ll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number.
We’ve shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we have more than 75,000 available to deploy.  Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator.  And if you remember, early on when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by, and now we’re the largest maker anywhere in the world, by far.  And not only are we fully supplied and stocked, but we’re helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get.
This is just the beginning.  In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history.  We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world’s premier medical manufacturer and supplier.  That’s what’s happening already.  It’s been happening now for quite some time.
We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots.  You can look at large portions of our country; it’s — it’s corona-free.  But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida.  It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon.  But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it’s starting to head down.
In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on.
And we, as you know, have done a excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse where they wanted to burn it down.  They’re anarchists.  Nothing short of anarchists, agitators.  And we have protected it very powerfully.  And if we didn’t go there, I will tell you, you wouldn’t have a courthouse.  You’d have a — you’d have a billion-dollar burned-out building.
We’re also working aggressively to combat the virus and Native American and Alaska Native communities.  Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in tribal communities, and we’ve worked very hard with tribal communities.  They’re very vulnerable to this horrible plague.  It’s the largest investment in Indian Country in U.S. history.  There’s never been an investment that big in Indian Country.
We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease.  It’s critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk — and, in fact, some are in — some age groups are at an extraordinary low risk themselves — they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk.
I ask all Americans, regardless of background or age, to practice social distancing — which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it; remain vigilant about hygiene; avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars; and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate.
Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before.
We’re looking at a very powerful year next year, economically.  The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly; set records.  The numbers on retail — retail sales — came in two weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country.  So we look like we’re heading to some very, very good economic times; that means jobs, that means stock market.
The stock market is already doing very well.  It’s getting to a point very close to where it was when we had this — when we were hit with the — the plague.  So I just want to thank everybody for being here.
Steve, please.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-july-28-2020/

3:33 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great to be in this wonderful state.  So many friends, so much success, and we love being here.  And we’re here, actually, today to discuss the exciting progress that we’ve achieved under the Operation Warp Speed — our historic initiative to develop, test, manufacture, and deliver a vaccine in record time.  And that’s what it is, in record time.  Likewise, therapeutically, we are very, very advanced.  You’re hearing about it and you’ll be hearing about it a lot more in the next two weeks.  We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing America’s scientific genius, which is what it is.
I’m therefore proud to announce that this morning, the Moderna vaccine has officially entered phase three already.  And that’s phase three clinical trials: the final stage before approval.  There’s never been anything like this, in terms of speed — nothing even close.  A second vaccine is likely to enter phase three in a matter of days.  Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve shaved years off of the time that it takes to develop a vaccine — in some cases, many years — and we’ve done it while maintaining the FDA gold standard for safety.  This is the fastest a vaccine for a novel pathogen has ever gone.  It has never gone like this.  And if you look at where we are, by phase three, we could say “ever gone by far.”
Four additional promising candidates are expected to enter final trials in the coming weeks, including the Novavax vaccine being developed right here at this facility.  It’s an incredible facility.  We’re going to be making a tour in a little while — a very, very complete tour — with the folks that run it and the people that operate.
We’ve just completed a tour of Fujifilm’s innovation laboratories — and that’s going to be done at a much, much higher level in a few minutes after I’m finished, and I believe we’ll take a few questions too — which were carrying out a crucial biomanufacturing process needed to make the Novavax vaccine.  This production is made possible by my administration’s $1.6 billion award to Novavax as part of Operation Warp Speed.  It lets us deliver the final product in a time that never has been achieved anywhere, at any time, for anything like this.
These same manufacturing processes are being conducted on an even larger scale in College Station, Texas.  Today, I’m proud to announce that HHS has just signed a $265 million contract with the Fujifilm-Texas A&M Innovation Center, which is quite the place, to dramatically expand their vaccine manufacturing capacity.  I want to thank Fujifilm CEO Martin Meeson for welcoming us today.  And Martin — where is, Martin?  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Martin.  It’s really wonderful to be with you under these circumstances in particular, with all the progress that’s being made.  As well as Novavax CEO, Stanley Erck.  Stanley, thank you very much.  Thank you very much for being here.
Thanks also to Secretary Alex Azar, who is with us; Senator Thom Tillis, thank you very much.  Thank you, Thom.  Stand up, Thom.  Good job you’ve done.  Thank you very much.  You really have.  Representatives Richard Hudson, David Rouzer, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Greg Murphey, thank you.  All friends.  All warriors.  Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who I hear is doing a great job — where is Dan?  Stand up, Dan.  Great job, Dan.  Really good.  North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore — thank you, Tim.  Great job.  And President pro tem of the North Carolina State Senate, Phil Berger.  Thank you, Phil, very much.  I appreciate it.
Operation Warp Speed is funding a historic portfolio of highly promising vaccine candidates.  In addition to our $1.6 billion investment in Novavax, we’ve issued a $483 million contract with Moderna, a $1.2 billion contract with AstraZeneca, a $465 million contract with Janssen, and just last week, a $1.95 billion agreement with Pfizer.  Tremendous progress is being made with all of those great companies.
A groundbreaking agreement with Pfizer includes a guarantee to deliver 100 million doses shortly after the vaccine’s approval — almost immediately — with the option to purchase an additional 500 million thereafter.  Not only is Operation Warp Speed accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery.  Nothing has happened like this since the end of World War Two.
Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously.  So everything goes at one time.  We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting; it’s all going at one time.  We have a system that has — I think it’s unparalleled.  Never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work, and work very well.
We’re mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that it’s approved, it’ll be available to the American people immediately.  And we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.  The world is suffering from this China virus.
Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus.  Over 140 clinical trials are underway, and a number of effective therapies have already been developed and widely delivered, including remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact — you see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically — dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, and antibody treatments.  We have numerous treatments right now that are under study, and I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that.
On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials.  Late stage.
Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was in April — think of that: 85 percent — and is 25 percent lower than Europe as a whole.
In the middle of April, more than 22 percent of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus.  As the last week, that number has dropped down — as of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7 percent.
To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing — very important.  In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together.  They’re pooled.  Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than — substantially more than 50 percent.
Last week, our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began distributing rapid point-of-care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.
What we’ve already sent includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point-of-care tests.  It’s a tremendous amount.  That’s — you’ll get your response and answer from 5 to 15 minutes.
Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point-of-care tests.  Think of that.  The United States has conducted over 52 million tests.  That’s more than all of Europe put together, times two.  Nobody is even close.  And as countries go, it is — as an example, India is up to 11 million tests.  We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests.  India has 1.4 billion people.
Through our relentless efforts, we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill.  The cupboards were bare.  I say it often.  In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100 million N95 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face shields, and much, much more.  In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month, and we’re distributing them — we have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need.  Other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus.
Last week, FEMA sent additional personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves, and 6 million gowns.  It’s a lot.
Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas, and Arizona held steady and are now heading down.  In Arizona, they’re heading very substantially down, and rapidly.  We’ve been constant — and in constant communication with the states, and are surging them resources when requested.  They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately.  We are totally full, we have everything we need, we get it to the states immediately, we deal with the governors.  The relationship with the governors has been very good.
These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly.  We are working with every governor and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendations.  States are different.
My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections, by far.  Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America, however, the region’s reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted.  And I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world.  We report our cases; most of the world doesn’t.  They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick, or they just don’t report it.
Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly infected countries outside of our borders.
I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott — terrific gentleman — and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas.  We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people.  We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators, and half a million KN90 masks.
Beginning this week, Texas hospitals will receive 500 cases of remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients.
In addition to the cross-border spread, this stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease but can spread the disease.  We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance.
I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars, and wear masks when appropriate.
We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk, which are, in most cases, in many cases, the elderly — especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes.  But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus especially — especially those that are really targeted — almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic, pandemic.
America will develop a vaccine very soon, and we will defeat the virus.  We will have it delivered in record time.  As our visit here demonstrates — and I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina.  This is a great — this is a great place.  It’s a phenomenal place.  And we’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time.
I want to drive the — the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible.  When they call them there, when they call — most of them, many of them are sitting here right now — I will always answer their call.
So thank you very much.  I appreciate you being here with us.  And let’s get on to a few questions.  Tremendous progress has been made, and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before.
So, please.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-covid-19/

597,Trump,2020-07-27 09:24:00+00:00,Remarks by Vice President Pence and Governor DeSantis of Florida in a Press Briefing on COVID-19,Nan,"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine
Miami, Florida
2:24 P.M. EDT
DR. FORD:  Well, good afternoon.  Mr. Vice President, Commissioner Hahn, Governor DeSantis, Governor — Congressman Díaz-Balart, other distinguished guests: It is truly a distinct honor and pleasure to extend a heartfelt welcome to you, to the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.
I’d like to thank each of you for your continued support, partnership, and tireless effort as we navigate the impact of COVID-19 on our community, the university, and our health system.
As I mentioned to the Vice President earlier, he could not have picked a better place to mark the start of the phase three COVID-19 vaccination trials.  The Miller School of Medicine was Florida’s very first medical school and is now home to South Florida’s first and only NCI-designated cancer center.
And the Gordon Center, where we are today, is one of the crown jewels of the university.  It is the home of the first cardiopulmonary simulator for medical education, named Harvey, and that structure has helped train tens of thousands of learners worldwide and continue to do so today.
And as an institution whose overarching mission and singular focus is to be at the forefront of advances in clinical care, medical education, and translational medicine to improve the health of our nation, we are pleased to host you, Mr. Vice President, your first visit to a phase three clinical trial site in the nation.
It is now my pleasure to introduce our governor and a great friend of the University of Miami, Ron DeSantis.
GOVERNOR DESANTIS:  Well, thank you, Dean.  In Florida, we had an interesting situation with our budget.  The budget was completed basically right before the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” was announced.  And so it was done in a financial situation that obviously changed dramatically.  We waited until the end of the fiscal year to consider that budget, but the budget vetoes that I had to issue were historic: a billion dollars.  I likened it to the Red Wedding version of line-item vetoes.
But even though we had to take off so much off the budget, we were able to support the Sylvester Cancer Center here at the University of Miami.  And I think that that’s a testament to, in one of the toughest years, to be able to be there.  It’s a testament to the great work that’s being done here across the board and with these clinical trials.  It’s even been more exciting.
I want to thank the Vice President.  Vice President Pence has been a great friend of the people of Florida.  He was down here, I remember, early on when we met at the terminal with the cruise — the cruise ship executives, and he’s been down multiple times, always willing to lend a helping hand.  And I’ll tell you, it’s been beneficial.
We’re encouraged by the most recent trends.  Yesterday, hospital admissions in the state of Florida for COVID-like illness was the lowest it’s been since June.  Emergency department visits for COVID-like illness yesterday was as low as it’s been since the middle of June.
And Florida’s case fatality rate is about 1.3 percent.  It’s one of the lowest case fatality rates in the country amongst large states.  And part of the reason is some of the great work that our medical professionals are doing here at the University of Miami Health System.  I learned in our roundtable: For admitted hospital patients with COVID, their fatality rate is 10 percent of the admitted hospital patients.  That is incredibly great results with a very difficult disease.  So I really want to thank the folks here who’ve been doing a great job saving lives and generating good patient outcomes.
Part of the reason I think people have also generated better outcomes is some of the therapeutics that have been developed, including this new therapeutic, remdesivir.  This was sent out to states a month or two ago when there was a more demand signal.  As more patients were coming into Miami hospitals, we needed to accelerate those shipments.  I called the Vice President, and I think, like, 48 hours later, it was all arriving at the hospitals across the state.
We’ve had to change the schedule to accelerate to make sure there was no gaps, and the White House has been there every time.  So I want to thank them for what they’ve done to be able to help our physicians have the remdesivir that they need to treat their patients.
And then, finally, I’m really excited that the federal government is sending point-of-care COVID diagnostic tests to nursing homes all across the country.  And as many of you know, we’ve had no visitations in nursing homes since middle of March.  It was the right thing to do.  We’ve done routine daily screening of staffing.  We’re doing bi-weekly testing of staff.  We’ve tested all the residents.  You know, we’ve obviously prohibited hospitals from sending COVID-positive residents back to nursing homes.  It’s been a big focus.  We sent millions of PPE — masks, face shields, all this other stuff.
But we haven’t been able to figure out, okay, when can they be able to see their loved ones.  It’s a tough balance.  But I think with this point-of-care test, you will be able to potentially have the visitation resume, where the family members can be tested, get an answer in 15 minutes, and then you get to go make that human connection.
And all the steps we take, there’s always costs on the other side, and we’ve done a lot to protect our nursing home residents.  I think our fatality rate there is testament to that.  But that has come at an emotional cost; it’s increased loneliness.  And we can’t just do that indefinitely.  This is a way to maintain the safety and still work to keep the virus out of these very vulnerable areas while still giving people some personal nourishment and having the families connect again.
So, Mr. Vice President, thank you for being a part of that.  We look forward to those landing in nursing homes throughout the state of Florida.  We want to thank you again for all you’ve done to help us amongst — along these many difficult months, but I do think that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, and a lot of that is due to your support.  So, thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Well, good afternoon.  I want to thank Governor Ron DeSantis and his entire team for the seamless partnership that they’ve forged with our administration since the early days of this pandemic.  We’ve worked together to ensure that Florida had the resources to do testing, that your hospital systems and incredible healthcare workers had PPE, ventilators.  And we’ve also been — we’ve also been working to make those therapeutics, like remdesivir, available in increasing measure.
But today is a historic day, because today, here at the University of Miami, we will begin the first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine in the United States.
Eighty-nine sites all across America, with more than 30,000 participants, will be a part of this phase three clinical trial.  But coming here to the University of Miami, to be able to partner with you, Dean Ford, and the entire team here is a great privilege.
And President Trump wanted me to be here — wanted me to be here, first and foremost, to say to the people of Florida that we are with you.  We’ll stay with you every step of the way.
We’re encouraged by the favorable trends here in Florida, but we’ll continue to make sure your healthcare workers have the resources to provide the level of care that any one of us would want a family member to be able to have: the level of care that’s been being delivered here at the University of Miami hospital system every day during the challenging days through which you have just passed.
But today is a day of hope.  Today is a day of promise.  And today is a day, I think, that — that is a tribute to American ingenuity and to President Trump’s relentless drive toward achieving medicines and a vaccine for the American people.
It’s remarkable to think that the company that will begin phase three today, a company known as Moderna, actually was the first company in America to begin phase one clinical trials back in the month of March.  And as Dr. Stephen Hahn of the FDA may reflect in just a moment, that was in record time.  Literally, it would just be a matter of weeks from when the United States first received the coding for the coronavirus that we were able to initiate an effort to develop a vaccine.  And in 62 days, a period of time never heard of in vaccine development, we were able to go to phase one trial.
But today, here in Florida, we begin the first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine, and we begin it — we begin it in a spirit of the same urgency and the same hopefulness from which it began.
We have moved, at President Trump’s direction, at a historic pace.  But as Dr. Hahn will also reflect, we are going to ensure that we move at a safe and effective pace.  And I want to assure the people of Florida and people all across this country that we will cut no corners in the development of this or any vaccine.
We’re truly grateful for the support of members of Congress in both political parties that have made more than $10 billion available.  I want to thank Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart, who is with us today, as well as the Florida delegation to the House and the Senate for their support.
Because it’s important to note that under Operation Warp Speed, we’re not even waiting to the end of clinical trials to create the vaccines.  Whether it be Moderna or it was announced last week with Pfizer, we’re actually having these companies produce the vaccines as we speak.  And as soon as they are confirmed to be safe and effective, we’ll have tens of millions of doses able to distribute across the country.  It is that initiative, the President launched in Operation Warp Speed that is a reflection of our commitment to bring these medicines, to bring a vaccine to the American people just as soon as we can responsibly do it.
But let me say — let me say thank you again to just a few more folks.  I want to thank Governor Ron DeSantis and his entire team for your leadership during the trying days through which Florida has just passed and throughout this pandemic.  It is a — it is a tribute to Governor DeSantis’s professionalism and to his heart that, from very early on, Florida has leaned into this effort.  And I particularly would commend the Governor’s efforts to look after seniors who we’ve known from the beginning — seniors with serious underlying health conditions — represented the most vulnerable to serious outcomes.  And it was efforts here in Florida that really — really became a model for long-term care around the country.  And we’ll continue, as the Governor said, to support those efforts in the days ahead.
I want to thank the University of Miami not just for being the site of the first phase three clinical trial, but just as much, Dean Ford and your team here, for everything that you’ve done throughout this pandemic and in the difficult weeks through which Florida has just passed.  To have a separate COVID-only hospital to be able to continue to operate your hospital for all the other healthcare needs in the community is a tribute to the innovation and effectiveness of the doctors and nurses and all the healthcare workers in this extraordinary facility.
Finally, I want to say thank you to all of those who’ve agreed to participate in this clinical trial.  It is remarkable to think 30,000 Americans were willing to step forward and to participate in this phase three clinical trial, and they have our thanks.  People who have volunteered to participate in this and other trials are doing more than their fair share to help our nation through this challenging time, and they have our thanks.
For anyone looking on who would like to be a part of either this clinical trial or other clinical trials for therapeutics or for vaccines, you can go to ClinicalTrials.gov and be a part.  That’s ClinicalTrials.gov, and you can get information on how you can participate.
But we all have a role to play.  And we all know that each and every one of us, by practicing good hygiene, washing our hands, wearing a mask every time that state and local authorities indicate it’s appropriate, or wearing a mask when you can’t properly socially distance is how each of us can play a role.  But for those Americans, literally more than 100,000 who have stepped forward and volunteered to participate in clinical trials around the country, you have our thanks as well.
Today, I said, is a great day in America.  The first phase three clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine begins here in Florida and in 89 different sites around the country.  And it begins with the best professionalism of our pharmaceutical companies in this country.  American innovation, American creativity begins with the hopes and, I know, the prayers of the American people.
And I’m convinced more than ever on this great day that we’ll get through this.  And we will reach that day, I truly believe, as Dr. Fauci said not long ago, when “if” not — or not “if,” but “when” we will have a vaccine, we’ll have it available to distribute to tens of millions of Americans.  And we’ll reach that day when we finally can begin to put this coronavirus in the past.
So with that, I’m going to turn it over to Dr. Stephen Hahn for his remarks and then — and then, really, one of the — one of the leaders of the clinical effort here at the University of Miami, and we’ll take a few questions.
Dr. Hahn?
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Dean Ford, and Dr. Doblecki-Lewis.  Thank you for hosting us today.  In the early part of this pandemic, President Trump and Vice President Pence asked FDA to make sure that we removed any unnecessary barriers to the development of medical products, and we have followed that request.
Today, we are seeing the initiation of the first phase three clinical trial of a vaccine candidate.  And that is, as to the Vice President said, a historic event in an incredibly short period of time.
I want to thank my colleagues — my medical colleagues who are in the frontline taking care of patients, but also who put together this clinical trial and are helping to enroll patients, and ensuring that it’s done in the absolute highest-quality way.
It is a true sign of America’s great biomedical research enterprise that we find ourselves here today.  Normally, this process would take months and years.  And it’s to the dedication of great medical professionals and researchers that we’ve gotten to this point.
Conducting clinical trials are a crucial piece of our efforts to approve a vaccine for COVID-19.  FDA has oversight over a number of clinical trials for both therapeutics and vaccines — in fact, over 140 — with more than 450 therapeutics in the pipeline.  And I want to thank, like the Vice President did, the Americans who have stepped forward to volunteer for these trials, because they are our true heroes as we evaluate the efficacy and safety of a vaccine.
Now, the important scientific data that we will get from the phrase three clinical trials — and this is, of course, one clinical trial that we’re going to see, but several others are planning to go to phase three in the next several weeks — and the data that come from those clinical trials will allow FDA to do its important work to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective.
And we’re doing everything we can at FDA to support that development by providing regulatory and scientific advice, as well as technical assistance for how to conduct those clinical trials; the number of people that need to be in those clinical trials so that we can have confidence in the data; as well as to make sure that there’s diversity in the clinical trial population, because what we want is to have generalizability of those results to the entire United States population.
As I mentioned, we expect a number of additional trials to go into phase three in the next several weeks to months, and that’s good news for the American people.
As we laid out in our guidance regarding vaccines and in all of our actions to COVID-19, FDA scientists will not cut corners in order to evaluate a medical product, and that includes a vaccine.  And I know that our colleagues performing these clinical trials want to have and must have confidence that we will do that as we evaluate the data that they generate for that vaccine.
It’s these scientists who will call the balls and strikes on approving a vaccine, and they will make their decisions based upon the data and science that’s generated from these clinical trials.  We will authorize or approve a vaccine solely on the basis of the data that we receive in the determination of safety and efficacy.
So I really appreciate the leadership of the University of Miami and other investigators around the country.  Again, it’s the truly great American research enterprise that allows us to get to this point, and Americans can have confidence in FDA that we will make the absolute best decision on their behalf.
Thank you.
DR. DOBLECKI-LEWIS:  Good afternoon.  I’m Susanne Doblecki-Lewis.  I’m the site principal investigator for the University of Miami site for the Coronavirus Prevention Network and for the first phase three clinical trial of that network, which is the Moderna vaccine trial.
We’re incredibly excited to begin this process here at the University of Miami, and we are really amazed and humbled by the number of volunteers who have already stepped forward to be a part of this trial.  And it’s these volunteers, as the others said, who will make the difference and will allow us to know whether we do have an effective and safe vaccine that can move forward.
Here at the University of Miami, we are very aware of the need to shape our enrollment to reflect our strength, which is the diversity of our population here, and particularly the diversity of people who are at high risk for COVID-19.  So we take that mandate very seriously, and we’ll plan to enroll 1,000 patients here; 500 will get the vaccine and 500 will get placebo.
We’ll follow those patients very carefully for two years after the second injection of the vaccine.  The vaccine consists of two injections, phased 28 days apart.  And we’ll be following extremely carefully, checking for any symptoms of potential COVID disease, and performing follow-up swabs and assessments to make sure that we completely understand the efficacy of the vaccine.
So we’re very, very happy to be at this point, and optimistic and looking forward to beginning our enrollment here.
Thank you.

1:36 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  The first duty of government is to protect the safety of our citizens.  That’s what Attorney General Barr said when he was here at the White House just a few days ago.  For 55 days in Portland, Oregon, we’ve seen lawlessness, anarchy, and destruction that threatens peace in our streets and the safety of our fellow American citizens and the safety of our brave law enforcement officers.
Yet some Democrats and some in the media continue to ignore reality.  As Portland’s — Portland’s Democrat Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted, quote, “What I saw last night was powerful in many ways.  I listened, heard, and stood with [the] protesters. And I saw what it means when the federal government unleashes paramilitary forces against its own people.”  That was a quote from the Democrat mayor who quite literally stood in the middle of a riot as violent protestors attacked a federal building.  That is appalling, and Mayor Wheeler is clearly failing at his duty to protect his streets and his city there in Portland.
The federal government has a sworn duty to uphold the laws of the United States through field offices and federal facilities across the country.  These agents protect and serve the American people.  Yet the rhetoric of the left undermines our justice system, with Nancy Pelosi calling them “stormtroopers,” Jim Clyburn calling them the “Gestapo,” and Wheeler using the term “paramilitary forces.”
Under President Trump, violent crime rates in America finally began to fall.  Rhetoric like this cannot be allowed to set us back.  Augmenting the Federal Protective Service, guarding federal property in Portland, our brave officers have — since — since augmenting them, I should say, our brave officers have faced all of these various things — like rioters barricading officers inside the Hatfield federal courthouse, trapping officers inside.  A, quote, “commercial-grade mortar firework” was launched by rioters.  A federal agents hand was impaled by planted nails.  Another federal agent was shot with a pellet gun, leaving a wound deep to the bone.  And tragically, three federal officers were likely left permanently blinded by the rioters using lasers pointed directly at their eyes.
These are not the actions of so-called peaceful protesters, and the Trump administration will not stand by and allow anarchy in our streets.  Law and order will prevail.
And I have a short video for you because I want it to be real what is happening right now in Portland.  So if we could play that video, that’d be great.
(A video clip is played.)
As you can see, that is anything but a peaceful protest.  And this President will always stand on the side of law and order.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-072420/

5:25 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
We’ve had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus.  I have reminded people of the importance of masks when you can’t socially distance, in particular.  A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places.
Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents.  We’re working very hard on that.  We’re doing very well all over the country.  And also about contracting with Pfizer — we made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer.  We think they’re very close — but we have a lot of companies that are very close — to produce a vaccine.
And I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you: This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida.  It’s a place I love.  I love that state.  The drawings look absolutely beautiful.  I never thought we could have something look so good, so fast with everything going on.  And everything was going well — a tremendous list of speakers; thousands of people wanting to be there — and I mean, in some cases, desperately be there.  They wanted to attend.  People making travel arrangements all over the country; they wanted to be there.  The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line.
But I looked at my team, and I said, “The timing for this event is not right.  It’s just not right with what’s happened recently — the flare up in Florida — to have a big convention.  It’s not the right time.”
It’s really something that, for me — I have to protect the American people.  That’s what I’ve always done.  That’s what I always will do.  That’s what I’m about.
They said, “Sir, we can make this work very easily.  We have great enthusiasm.  Incredible enthusiasm.  Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they’ve seen.  We can do this safely, and we can do it responsibly.”
And I said, “There’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that’s from the China virus or the radical-left mob that you see in Portland” — where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days.  They went in, and people were out of control for 51 days — a long time.  And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in, and they’ve done a great job protecting our property — the federal courthouse and other property — and, most importantly, protecting our people.  Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit — a lot of other cities where so many people are shot, and so many people are killed.  And people elected me to help and to protect.
So, I told my team, “It’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention.”  We’ll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday, as has always been planned.  We were never taking that off.  That’s remaining as it is.  The delegates are going to get together.  That’s where they do their nomination.  So, the delegates are going to North Carolina, and they’ll be doing the nomination.  And we’re going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online — the week that we’re discussing, which will be really good.  I think we’re going to do it well.  And I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won’t do a big, crowded convention per se.  It’s just not the right time for that.
I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country — and even in the world — who would be coming into the state, and I don’t want to do anything to upset it.  They’ll be doing very well very shortly.  We’re going to put some maps up of the country behind me, and you’ll see that the area that we’re talking about is a hotspot.  You will also see a lot of the country is — has no problem whatsoever — most of the country, actually.  So I’m always going to take care of you, so that that’s the way we’re going to do it.
I’ve spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders.  I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and its great mayor.  He’s a great — great guy.  Really great guy.  They wanted it so badly.  And all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida.  And just very special people — a very special group.  And they were there for us, 100 percent.
Today, I want to provide an update on the actions we’re taking to support the safe reopening of America’s schools.  Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they’re essential to our children’s future.  Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high-risk factors can continue to participate from home.  Very important.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.  It said, quote:
    “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in [a] social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical [and] sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation.  This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.  Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been [a] substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and [for] families.”
So, that’s very important, and there’s a highway — it goes both ways.
The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.”  Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important.
One study estimates that, due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35 percent behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50 percent behind in math.  That’s a big statement.
According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income black and Hispanic students.  They’re the ones that are hit the hardest.  We don’t want that happening.
Thirty million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals.  Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools.  According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly, having to do with child abuse, they have neglect — and these are neglect and neglected cases are submitted by education personnel.  So people in the education world, on the premises, will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children.  They know if they’ve been neglected.  They know if they’ve been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it’s at home or someplace else.  But they see this at school.  You don’t get to see that if you’re not going to school.  It’s a big thing.
Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus, very substantially.  When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare.  Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions.  Ninety-nine percent of all China virus hospitalizations are adults.  And 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults.  That means that children are a tiny percentage — less than 1 percent, and even a small percentage of 1 percent.
In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to the coronavirus.  Many different names.  Many, many different names.
The life of every child is sacred and must be protected.  Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America’s children.
I have a very, very special person who loves children, who is — who is, I think, one of the greatest athletes of all time.  A lot of people say “the greatest pitcher of all time.”  Known as a “relief pitcher” who could have been whatever he wanted.  Some people — he is the greatest reliever of all time, by far.  Substantially more saves than anybody else.  In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently.
And he — I’m reading off these stats.  I knew he was the best.  I knew he was great, but I didn’t know it was almost double anybody else.  But he’s a man who loves children — has children, loves children, works hard with children.  We’re going to go outside and be with some little leaguers.  Mariano Rivera — you know, he’s the “Sandman,” right?  My wife said, “Darling, why do they call him the ‘Sandman’?”  I said, “You know, they play the song.  He just puts the batters to sleep.”  And that’s exactly what happened.
So, having Mariano here is a great honor.  Thank you very much.  He was talking about children in schools.  And there’s nobody that’s done more than you have.  Thank you very much, Mariano.  Fantastic man.
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and to protect students.  And we do have to protect the teachers and the families also; we have to remember that.
All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance.  This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at high risk.
In cities or states that are current hotspots — and you’ll see that in the map behind me — districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks, and that’s possible.  That’ll be up to governors.  The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community, but every district should be actively making preparations to open.
Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours.  They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem.  So, it’s pretty amazing actually.  Great, great credit.
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide.  As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk — much lower, in the case of young children — to resume work and school and — as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing.  We want that.
A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms.  We don’t want to do that.
At the same time, we have to get our economy going.  We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday.  Housing prices — pricing of housing up 21 percent.  It’s the highest in history.  It’s the highest number in history.  Real estate housing went up 21 percent.
Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely.  I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions.  This isn’t about politics; it’s about something very, very important.  This is not about politics.  I even think it’s bad politics if you do the wrong decision.  Very bad politics.
We’re asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill.  This funding will support mitigation measures, such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aides, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing, and crucially, mask-wearing.  This money is in addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year.  That money we have; some is distributed, and some is not distributed.
If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice.  The key word being “choice.”  If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions.  So we’d like the money to go to the parents of the student.  This way, they can make the decision that’s best for them.
We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school — harming their mental, physical, and emotional development.  Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families.
The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year.  That’s a tremendous problem.  It’s a tremendous problem.  Schools have to open safely, but they have to open.
More than a dozen European countries — as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others — have already reopened schools, and cases have not risen.  We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.
We’ll continue to support states and cities in the current hotspots in the South, Southwest, and West.  The governors — I know them all.  They’re all very, very capable.  They’re doing a very good job.  They’re working so hard.  You wouldn’t even believe it.
We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance.  We’re helping with doctors and nurses — medical personnel of all kinds.  As a PPE update, we’re in close communication with governors and states.
We have supplies — everything they could possibly need.  We’re very strong on supplies.  Remember I used to say the cupboards were bare?  Well, now the cupboards are the opposite.
Due to our historic efforts to increase both the National Stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days’ worth of supplies on hand.  And most importantly, they have ventilators — because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past.  Now we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them, in many cases, to other countries.
For states that are making requests, we’re rapidly delivering.  In the last 24 hours, FEMA has deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000 — well, let me change that.  We’ve created about 600,000 different supplies.  We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington.  I think the number is 600.  We’ll go check that, and we’ll give it you in a little while.  But we’ve — we’ve got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators.  I think we’ve sent out about 600 just recently.
The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world, by far.  Roughly half of the tests are either the rapid, point-of- care tests, which, frankly, solves a lot of problem in delay — 5 to 15 minutes, instead of waiting for service both ways, in both directions, and then at the lab.  But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are 5- to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day — in some cases, immediately.
We’re continuing to surge testing to current ho- — hotspots, such as Miami and Phoenix, to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further.
This is a copy of the map, and this is a — you have it right behind me.  That’s really very much indicating where the problems are.  You see from — from that, it’s in great shape — lots of it.  The Northeast has become very clean.  The country is in very good shape, other than if you look South and West — some problems.  That will all work out.
On therapies: We’ve worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of remdesivir are arriving this week.  That’s a lot.  That’s a really — that’s a lot.  They’re working around the clock to make it.  It’s had a tremendous impact.  We’ve also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks.  Arizona is doing very well; it’s heading down.  The numbers are heading down, I think, very quickly.  The governor has done a great job.  They’ve all done a great job.  They’ve all done a great job.  Working hard.
We’ll continue to monitor the areas rising and — with respect to cases.  And we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation — this horrible disease that was sent to us by China.
It should not have been sent.  They should have stopped it.  They could have stopped it.  They didn’t.  And the entire world has gotten infected, and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now.
This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they’re going through a very hard time with this — in Moscow, in particular.  I spoke to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.  They’re doing well, but they’re going through a lot.  Everybody is going through a lot.
Yesterday, I spoke to the heads of four different countries.  All four are going through a lot.  They’re going through a hard time.
This could have been stopped.  It could have been stopped quickly and easily.  But for some reason, it wasn’t, and we’ll figure out what that reason was.
So, with that, if you have any questions — please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072320/

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room


5:50 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today, my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval.  Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly.  And we think we have a winner there.  We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well on the vaccines — long ahead of schedule.
As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter.  This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time — really a very small fraction of the time, based on previous schedules.  I want to thank the FDA.  I want to thank everybody involved.  It’s been an incredible process.
As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens, as we all know.  The median age for those who die from the virus is 78 years old, and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.  That’s really something.
In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1 percent of the U.S. population.  So think of that: less than 1 percent, half of the fatalities.  So we know what to look for.
From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors.  In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities.  And we gave it a very strong priority.  FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it’s going directly to 15,400 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified nursing homes throughout the country.
Today, I’d like to provide an update on the additional actions we’ve been able to take, and they’ve been very constructive.  First, we’re requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in states where you had the worst outbreaks.  All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We’re distributing 15,000 rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices to support this effort.  These are the tests where it takes five minutes to fifteen minutes.  They’re very accurate. They’re very good.  And we’re sending them all over the country.  And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities.
Second, HHS will be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes.  Nursing homes in higher-risk areas will be receiving more funding.  This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing, and providing technology support so residents can connect their families and they can connect to their families.  They are having a tremendous time.  They want to be with their loved ones.  They can’t do it, so what we’re doing is we’re working it so that we can connect — have them connect with their families if they’re not able to visit.
Third, we’ve been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the governors, so that the governors and their staffs can take appropriate action.  We’re able to find — because of the testing programs and other means, we’re able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The governors can then take action.
Additionally, CMS, CDC, and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest-risk nursing homes.  And that’s their priority right now: nursing homes, but the highest-risk nursing homes.
CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most.  And we have them surveyed, and we have them mostly pinpointed.
Over the past few months, we’ve created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks.  And currently, 99 percent of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it, so we have great data.  When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert the state and make sure that it responds very quickly.  We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly.
I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life.  We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope.  The light is starting to shine.  We will get there very quickly.  But we send our love; we send a message of love — very important.  We’re with you all the way.
As far as the outbreak in the Sun Belt, I said yesterday: We continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the South and Southwest and the West.  We’re closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida.  Arizona is starting to come down.  Done a very good job.  They’re all doing a good job.  They’re very talented people.
There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections.  Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations — which you know very well about — which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide.  And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places — maybe beaches — four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide — likely also contributed.
We’re also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately.  I was with the President, and it’s a big problem for Mexico.  But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
Two hundred and fifty-seven miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great, positive impact on people coming in.  And we have record-low numbers of people coming in illegally; that’s helped greatly.  It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we’re doing right now and for the pandemic.
Nationwide, beyond the outbreak in several states, cases remain low and very stable.  Nineteen states have positive test rates of less than 5 percent.  Eight states have positive test rates of less than 2 percent.  Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8 percent, compared to over 16 percent at its peak in April.  It’s coming down.  It’s coming down fairly rapidly.
Today, we surpassed — first time — we surpassed 50 million tests.  That’s far more than any country in the world.  India is second, we believe.  We think — 1.4 billion people; that’s about 12 million tests.  We have 50 million tests.
We’re working with every state to ensure the supply of remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill.  We’re working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes — everybody.  The remdesivir has proven to be terrific.  Our case fatality rate continues to decline, and we want to push this rate even lower.
The therapeutic research continues daily on new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use of blood thinners and steroids.  A lot of different things are happening, and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn’t have known a number of months ago.  We’re doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines.
And, frankly, therapeutically — or maybe a word even beyond that word is “cure” — would be the best of all, and we’ll see what happens.  But that would be great if we could go into the hospital, and just cure people.  And we’re at a position we’re actually able to — to a certain extent, with what we have right now.  And we think, in a very short period of time, we’ll be able to do that.
Our strategy is to shelter the highest-risk Americans, while allowing younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant.  Wear a mask, socially distance, and repeatedly wash your hands.  Practice very, very good sanitary means.  You have to do this.  You have to just — you have to look at it differently.  Wash your hands often.  I’m finding more and more people are saying, “Wash your hands.”  So wash your hands.  We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.
And we’re all in this together.  And as Americans, we’re going to get this complete.  We’re going to do it properly.  We’ve been doing it properly.  Sections of the country come up that we didn’t anticipate — for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera — but we’re working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it’s all going to work out, and it is working out.
So, with that, I’ll take a few questions, please.  Yeah, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-072220/

626,Trump,2020-07-21 08:37:00+00:00,Remarks by Vice President Pence and Governor McMaster of South Carolina in Press Briefing,Nan,"Pastides Alumni Center
University of South Carolina
Columbia, South Carolina
1:37 P.M. EDT
GOVERNOR MCMASTER:  I’d like to welcome everyone here to the University of South Carolina.  This is where we’ve had many of our meetings concerning the pandemic.  And we’ve gotten a lot of great ideas in this place, and we got some more today.  We appreciate very much the effort of the Vice President, Secretary, the Administrator, and coming here and being with us, as well as Superintendent.
And we look forward very much to your questions.
Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Well, thank you, Governor McMaster.  I want to thank you and First Lady Peggy for the hospitality today.  Karen and I are honored to be here with you, grateful for your strong and steadfast leadership throughout this pandemic.  And as we see cases rising across South Carolina, on behalf of the President and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, Governor McMaster, I want to thank you for the seamless partnership that we have forged on behalf of the health and wellbeing of the people of South Carolina.
But with rising cases here in the state, the President wanted me to be here today with a very simple message for the people of South Carolina, and that is: We are with you.  And we’re going to work closely with your governor and with all your state health officials to make sure that the people of this state have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and the therapeutics, and the supplies to meet this moment.
And, Governor, I — again, I want to — I want to thank you for organizing the discussions that we had today.  I mean, having the opportunity to meet with your health team, to hear your perspective on what’s happening on the ground in South Carolina, and the great efforts that healthcare workers are making all across this state and the great cooperation of the people of South Carolina, I know that we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together.
President Trump will be briefing the nation later today on our administration’s efforts, working with states, particularly across the Sun Belt, with the — in midst of rising cases.  But let me just say a few words about our response.
As, Governor, you know with — the rise in cases across the Sun Belt is serious, but the people of South Carolina should know that we are in a much better place to respond to this pandemic across the south than we were two and three months ago.
But because of the partnership we’ve forged with your governor, with governors around the country; because of the whole-of-America response that President Trump initiated that has taken testing to nearly 50 million tests having been performed across the country; the development of hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment; over 100,000 ventilators being constructed in 100 days; and the rapid development of therapeutics, whether it be remdesivir or convalescent plasma, or others that are under active consideration at the FDA — that, combined with the Operation Warp Speed’s development of vaccines, we are leaning into this effort and we are — we are in a much better place to make sure that your governor and your healthcare providers in this state have the support and resources, but to provide any member of your family with the level of healthcare that we would want for a member of our family.
We’re proud of what South Carolina has accomplished.  Governor, I think, in March, you were performing roughly 540 tests per day; now nearly 10,000 tests a day.  And — and I also want to commend you, Governor, for the efforts you’ve made protecting the most vulnerable.
From very early on, we’ve recognized that seniors with serious underlying health conditions represent those most vulnerable to the coronavirus.  And to that end, Seema Verma, in a few moments, will detail a plan that we unveiled last week building on our efforts to focus resources and measures and standards on nursing homes.  We announced last week that the federal government will be distributing point-of-care tests — 15-minute tests — to all 15,400 nursing homes in America, beginning at the end of this week.  And Seema Verma, with the Center for Medicaid and Medicaid Services, will describe that.
With regard to supplies: I’m informed, Governor, that as of July 9th, FEMA and HHS have delivered to South Carolina
nearly a half a million surgical masks, not including nearly 400,000 N95 respirators, tens of thousands of face shields and coveralls.  And we’ve also made certain that you will continue to have the ventilators here in South Carolina that are — that are needed for people facing the most serious consequences.
Seema Verma will also talk for a moment about healthcare capacity.  We are monitoring healthcare capacity across the Sun Belt.  And while there are instances where some hospitals in states that are being impacted by rising cases, there are instances where individual hospitals are beginning to reach capacity.
The report that we received today here in South Carolina and all across the Sun Belt is that overall hospital capacity remains strong, hospital beds are available.  But we launched a new website this week to make sure that hospitals are giving us real-time information so that we can continue to work with states to make sure that that remains the case and that hospitals have the supply that they need.
But beyond all of that — and we’re focused on saving lives, protecting our most vulnerable, but as we discussed today, we’re also focused on reopening America: opening up America again and opening up America’s schools.  And, Governor, I want to — I want to commend you for your steady efforts to put the people of South Carolina back to work.  I’m informed that more than 105,000 South Carolinians have joined or rejoined the workforce in the month of June, and your unemployment rate in this state has dropped from over 12 percent to just under 9 percent.
I think the American people and people across this state realize that when it comes to a choice between dealing with the pandemic or opening up America, it’s not an either/or; we can do both.  We all have a role to play.  All of us need to do our part to practice personal hygiene, wash our hands, wear a mask wherever state or local authorities determine it’s indicated or where the social distancing is not possible.
But, Governor, you’re proving here in South Carolina that you can put this economy back to work.  And you’ve already unveiled a plan to reopen schools across South Carolina, and that was much of what our discussion was today.
And on behalf of the President and our entire task force, I want to thank you.  I want to thank you for leading the way on getting our kids back in the classroom.  We heard today from education leaders from across this state, and I was — I was deeply inspired by the words that I heard.
In just a few moments, I’ll yield the podium to the Superintendent of Anderson School District Five.  Superintendent Tom Wilson today reflected very memorably on the academic impact on children, especially children who are struggling learning how to read.  The reality is that the — that without getting our kids back into school this fall, children that are struggling academically, children that are struggling with learning how to read will fall farther and farther behind with long-term consequences on their academic future and needs.
Also, I was deeply moved today to hear from Janie Neeley, the mother of a special needs 4-year-old by the name of Marsh.  Marsh has Down’s syndrome.  And Janie spoke very eloquently about — about the fact that Marsh misses his friends.  He misses his teachers.  He misses the counseling that he receives as special needs students do uniquely in schools around this country.
And so, Governor McMaster, we commend you for your efforts to get our kids back into school.  And we commend President Caslen’s efforts to reopen the University of South Carolina.  We understand we don’t want our kids to fall behind academically, as Superintendent Wilson reflected, but also, it’s so important to recognize — whether it’s special needs, whether it’s nutrition needs, whether it’s counseling for emotional needs — millions and millions of children across this country rely on services that are only available at their schools.
And so for the sake of their academic wellbeing, for the sake of their personal wellbeing, Governor, you recognized today, as your team did, that it’s vitally important that we reopen our schools.
It’s also: To reopen the American economy, we got to reopen our schools.  It’s — the reality is that for working parents, working moms and dads, there is a great hardship in children not returning to school.  I heard a statistic on the way here that that less than 25 percent of single parents are able to telework, which puts a great, great burden on their ability to both be a parent and also provide for their family.
In hearing all that good counsel today, I just reiterated to the governor that we’re going to continue to provide the resources and the guidance so that states like South Carolina can safely reopen schools, as you reopen your economy and deal with rising cases across this state.
I’m pleased to report, with a grateful nod to your congressional delegation, especially Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott, that we’ve already secured more than $30 billion in funding for states: $13 billion for elementary and secondary education, and more than $14 for higher education.  And I know, Governor, you just made an announcement about the distribution of those resources to school systems and universities here in South Carolina.
I’ll also pledge to you that our team is on Capitol Hill today negotiating and discussing a phase four of our recovery and relief legislation.  And the President made it clear to our negotiators yesterday that we want education funding to be a centerpiece of any additional recovery efforts by the Congress of the United States.  And so more help is on the way, Governor, and we’re going to continue to support your efforts and efforts across this country to get our kids back to school.
And finally, we’ll continue to give additional guidance. From early March, the Centers for Disease Control has issued consistent guidance for schools, providing additional tools for operating schools safely.
And in the days ahead, the CDC will be issuing additional decision-making tools for parents and guardians, preparing K-12 school administrators for a safe return in the fall, and limitations and considerations on symptom screening and the like.  That guidance will be forthcoming in the days ahead, and we look forward to providing that to you, as well as to all the great education leaders all across this state.
Finally, let me just say to the people of South Carolina what I said in the beginning — is that on behalf of the President of the United States and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force: We’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you every step of the way until we put this coronavirus in the past.  We’re going to continue to partner — partner with the — with your governor and with all your health officials and your hospitals to make sure our healthcare workers have the support and the supplies that they need to render healthcare to anyone impacted by the coronavirus.  And we’re going to continue to work — continue to work in ways that can open up the state’s economy again and get our kids back into school.
But we all do have a role to play.  We can slow the spread. We can flatten the curve.  We can save lives.  What we saw when this pandemic first struck our country was that with the full cooperation of the American people, with the full support of our healthcare workers, we can accomplish those things.  We did it in the Greater New York City area; we did it in New Orleans and Michigan, and other places.  We have every confidence that with the full cooperation the American people, the dedication of our healthcare workers, with the strong leadership of administrations like yours, Governor McMaster, that we will do it again in the Sun Belt.
But I do want to encourage each one of your citizens, as I said before, to heed local guidance when it comes to wearing a mask or where — or just wear a mask when social distancing is not possible.  Wash your hands.  Practice — practice personal hygiene.  Each one of us has a role to play, and we’ll get through this, I know, by putting the health of our neighbors first, looking after the future of our economy, looking after the future of our kids, getting our schools back open again.  And we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this together.
With that, I’m going to recognize the Secretary of Education for a report, and the Director of the — of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
But before that, I ask the Superintendent, Tom Wilson, of Anderson School District 5 to share a few of his thoughts on just how important it is that schools in South Carolina reopen, and maybe to reflect for a few moments on the plan that they’ve announced to get kids back in the classroom in school district 5 starting on September the eighth.
Superintendent.
SUPERINTENDENT WILSON:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Governor McMaster.  I shared with the panel a few moments ago our plans to reopen schools in Anderson School District 5.  We will open September the 8th.  We will give parents a choice of face-to-face or a virtual academy that’s being developed, where they can — we’ve been surveying our parents.  We believe we’ll have about 20 percent of our parents choose to do that, but it is a choice of the parents.  At the semester break in January, they’ll have the possibility come back to face-to-face, if they so desire, and hopefully the spread will be somewhat flattened at that point.
I think what resonated with the group a few moments ago was what I want to share with you: As of March the 16th, all the schools in this state were closed.  And Anderson School District 5, we were way ahead of everybody because we had developed it. We were the first school district in the state to have e-learning.  We piloted e-learning.  And other districts followed us, and we mentored other districts.
And we invested millions and millions of dollars in technology, Chromebooks — from kindergarten to 12th grade — digital integration specialists, fix-it people to keep things up and running.
E-learning — and you might hear the word “remote learning,” “e-learning,” different terms — it was never intended for 25 percent of the school year for kids to be out of school.  It was intended, in this state, for three or four days, when we had to call school off for snow.  But we were the best of a bad lot because we were the best at e-learning, and, still, it was very successful for a lot of students, but it was not successful for a lot of students, primarily the poor, the low income, single parents.
And the difficulty we had is when mom or dad has to be at Electrolux making refrigerators at 7:00 a.m. — they cannot telework.  Teleworking is really, quite honestly, a professional opportunity for professional staff.  They can’t.  They have to work.  They work with their hands.  They build things.
And as a result, we had a lot of kids who had very little support.  Our research tells us that if a child has a ineffective teacher for two years in a row, the chances of them graduating from high school is basically slim to none.  If they have no teacher for two years in a row, I assure you they will not graduate.  And what keeps me up at night are those kids that left us on March the 16th that were kindergarteners, first graders, second graders, third graders, fourth, and maybe even fifth graders, that were struggling readers.
And I dare say there may be a few people in this room that could teach somebody how to read.  I can’t.  I’ve been doing — I’ve been in public schools for 44 years; been a principal teacher, superintendent.  I ca- — I don’t know how to teach your child to read.  That’s not my — I wasn’t trained.  Teaching reading is a science and it’s also an art, and it has to be done at the shoulder of a child, for most children.
And so what I worry about are those struggling readers.  If we don’t get them back face to face with a teacher, six, seven years from now, eight years from now, we’re going to see a dropout rate like we’ve never seen, because kids drop out of school because they find it irrelevant and boring.  And when they get on up in where they can drop out, then they’ll quit and they won’t graduate.  And all of us in this room and all of us in this state and all of us in this country are going to pay the burden and pay the price for that, because what will happen: We’ll continue to put more people on the train and less people pulling it.  And those of us that are pulling, and everybody in this room, it will cost us more because they will never be able to get it.
Those of you who have little children: We can teach a 5-year-old Spanish like that, but try to teach it to a 40-year- old or a 25-year-old; it’s very difficult.
So, reading is essential.  That’s crucial.  I worry about the elementary a lot more than a high school.  I told our teachers, our principals: The tip of the spear is our elementary teachers because that’s where — that — that’s where the battle will be won.  And we look forward to doing that.
I commend the Governor for his support of opening schools, and we’re going to do it.  And we look forward to getting back.  We look forward to working with our virtual academy.  And it’s been an honor to be with you today, Governor, Vice President.  And thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great words, Tom.  Thank you.
Betsy.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President.  It’s really a privilege to be here with you in South Carolina today.  Governor McMaster, thank you so much for hosting us and for your leadership here in the Palmetto State.  And, Superintendent Wilson, thank you for so clearly articulating how imperative it is that kids be able to get back to school this fall.
I really resonated also, in the previous session, with what Dr. Caslen said.  And he said, “As South Carolina’s flagship university, I believe that we bear the responsibility to open our doors to students, most of whom are eager to resume their education in person and on campus.”  We must get schools back open, and we know we can do it safely.  The science on this is clear, and it’s only growing stronger.  It’s critical to students’ health and wellbeing.  It isn’t a question of health versus safety; it’s a question of health versus health.  Students need access to the services they receive at school.  They need to be with their teachers and their friends and they need to be learning and growing.  Thanks to the President’s leadership, we’ve made sure the needed resources are there to make it happen safely.
South Carolina’s K-12 schools have already received $126 million under the CARES Act.  But we know — also know that for too many students, especially the most disadvantaged, they might — may not have the right option for them and their families right now, or their assigned school may just be refusing to open.
And I think of what mom Janie Neeley said in the previous session about the need for her son, Marsh, to have that in-person experience with teachers and with students.  And I think also about Principal Akis [sic] Ross — Akil Ross, who talked about the imperative to be focusing on what students need and doing the right thing for students.
I want to applaud again Governor McMaster for the leadership he’s shown in supporting all students.  These Safe Access to Flexible Education, or SAFE, grants he announced yesterday will ensure that a student’s personal and family circumstances don’t limit them from accessing the best education possible.  This is a model, frankly, that the nation should follow.  It’s the President’s vision for every American student and why he’s fighting to pass school choice now.
We know that Congress is looking at how to best provide more relief, and this administration is going to fight for every student to go back to school safely and at a school that will best meet their unique needs.
When the assigned schools fail to rise to the challenge, we believe students and parents deserve a choice to go somewhere else, and the tax dollars meant to support their students’ education should go with them, not to a system.
So with that, again, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your leadership, and I look forward to continuing to work to ensure all students can get back to their learning safely and promptly.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thanks.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  And thank you, Governor, for hosting us today.  It’s a pleasure to be here, and appreciate all of your strong efforts on opening schools.
You know, one of the things with the Medicaid program that I run is that we provide a lot of healthcare services inside the schools.  Kids get vision services, they get screenings, immunizations.  And so it’s not only part of their learning; these healthcare services are important to their health, but also for their ability to learn.  So, really appreciate your efforts to open the schools.
When the pandemic started, the President and the Vice President were very clear on our mission: protecting the vulnerable and making sure that healthcare workers on the frontlines had what they needed to fight this battle.
And so let me start with nursing homes.  That’s our — one of our most vulnerable populations.  We know that nursing homes have been hit hard, but also, for the residents, it’s been an extraordinarily difficult time.  They’ve been separated from their families, haven’t had a chance to visit, and then many times, they’re restricted inside the room.  So it’s been a very difficult time, but we appreciate all of the strong leadership, especially at the state level.
We asked states at the very beginning to do inspections across the board of their nursing homes.  Almost 97 percent of those have been completed in South Carolina.  And the President has also wanted to make sure that nursing homes have the tools that they needed.  FEMA has been sending supplies directly to nursing homes.  We’ve also made grants available to nursing homes so that they can buy iPads and computers so that their residents can communicate with their loved ones.
And more recently, as we’re opening up, we want to make sure that nursing homes have the continued focused on testing.  We’ve asked that they test their resident — at least do a one-time pass.  And also, for their healthcare workers, that they do that testing on a weekly basis.
And we announced last week that we’re going to be providing point-of-care tests inside the nursing home to every nursing home across the country — that’s over 15,400 nursing homes — and that’s going to allow them to do rapid testing, get those results back in 15 minutes.  They can identify staff that have been impacted and also make sure that residents that are — that are sick and those — and separate the ones that are sick from those that are not.  And so that’s going to be a critical effort.
It also relieves the testing as some of the — it relieves the system, in terms of the testing capacity.  If nursing homes can do that inside their nursing home, then that relieves the labs from being able to test more people.  So that’s really critical as well.
And then, finally, it’s also that path forward for patients, residents to be united with their families, because that point-of-care testing could also enable visitors.  So we’re very excited about that.  We think this is going to be very important for our nursing homes.
And also, one of the other things that we’re doing with our nursing homes across the country is making sure that they have the support.  We’ve engaged our quality improvement organizations to go inside nursing homes.  So once inspectors have identified problems, we’re actually putting organizations on the ground to provide them the support, answer any questions, and make sure that they have a safe environment for residents.
The other piece that the Vice President mentioned today was the HHS Protect system.  And we announced this week that we are putting up a system which allows our hospitals to directly report information to HHS.  And they — the type of information that they’re reporting are their inpatient beds, their ICU capacity.  That gives us the ability to make sure that they have the supplies that they need, whether it’s remdesivir, whether it’s N95 masks.
Us understanding what’s going on in the hospital, in terms of their capacity, the patients they’re seeing, is so critical.  And we appreciate the hospitals across the country that have voluntarily provided that data to us.  And it’s just so critical to making sure that those healthcare heroes that are on the frontlines have the supplies and the support that they need.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Great.

5:10 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, and good afternoon.  Today, I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control.  It seems largely in Sun Belt but could be spreading.
My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package.  We’re working very hard on it.  We’re making a lot of progress.  I also know that both sides want to get it done.  We’ll call it “phase four.”  I think we’re going to get it done.  We’ll protect our workers, our schools, and our families, and protect them very strongly.
As one family, we mourn every precious life that’s been lost.  I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus.  We’re doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development.  But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders.  The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave.
My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important.  We’ve learned so much about this disease.  And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them.
And again, the vaccines are coming, and they’re coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years.  If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years.
The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we’ve learned a great deal about it and who it targets.  We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful.  We’ve developed them as we go along.  Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well.  It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better — something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.  It’s the way — it’s what we have.  If you look over the world, it’s all over the world, and it tends to do that.
The governors are working very, very hard, and we are supporting them 100 percent.  Everything they need, they get.  And we are taking good care.  We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it’s ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need.  So that’s a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards.
The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old.  Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care.  In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it’s heart or diabetes, but usually it’s some kind of a condition.  It seems that people have that.  And if they do, it’s a problem — no question about it.
Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms.  They won’t even know they’re sick.  They won’t have any idea that they have a virus.  They won’t have any idea at all.
America’s youth will act responsibly, and we’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask.  Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.  They’ll have an effect.  And we need everything we can get.
Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk.  99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults.  Think of that. So that’s much, much, much less than 1 percent for children, young people.
By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we’ve been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States.  In fact, we’ll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world.  We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment.  And we have many more happening and coming out.
We’ve learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we’ve shared them all over the world.  The relationship with other countries has been very strong.  We’re all working together.  This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment, including high-flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators.
And when you’re on a ventilator, we’ve learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator.  And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators.  But the doctors have become incredibly — and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure.
And allocating remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization.  And that’s something that they’ve really started.  They’re using it much earlier.  Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April.  It’s a great number.
As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit states, which you’re looking at right now, we’re surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics.  We again have tremendous amounts of supplies.  We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly.
Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world.  If you watch American television, you’d think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus.  Well, the world is suffering very badly.  But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they’ve been suffering from this virus for a long time.
We’ve done much better than most.  And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it’s something that we can talk about, but we’re working, again, with them because we’re helping a lot of countries that people don’t even know about.  I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators.  They need help with ventilators; they have to get them.  They’re very hard to get.  We’re making thousands now a month — thousands of ventilators a month.  It’s been quite amazing.
We keep doing the good job, and things will get better and better.  We’ll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success and, I guess you could say also, things that we can do better on.  But you’ll see them.  There’ll be put up as we go.
In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old.  Today, the average age is significantly younger.  Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April.  So the stays are about half.  The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced.  And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one half of what it was in April.
We’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it.  The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators but in many other things.  And things are happening too, like the remdesivir and other elements, steroids, et cetera.
But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus.  And that’s what we have — we have a relentless focus.  And it’s been that way from the beginning.  But we have learned so much.
As you know, in recent weeks we’ve seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our south — if you look at South, Southwest, and West.  This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18- to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic.
We’re also facing the challenge of a significant spice[spike] in virus cases across the rest of the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico.  Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard.  As you know, the president, a great gentleman, was here two weeks ago.  And they have really been hit hard.
Because we’ve achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in two months, we’re successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases.  Some cases so mild that you really don’t even treat them.  Some cases with children, where they don’t even know that they’re ill.  And I guess they’re not very ill because they recover almost immediately.
Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50 percent more tests than Europe, and we’ve conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the Western Hemisphere combined.  We’ll be over 50 million tests.  This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms.  So we know exactly where it’s going and when it’s going to be there.
We’re also working to reduce turnaround time.  My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt, and we continue to do so, working very close with all governors, but right now, in particular, those governors.
We’re coordinating closely with hospitals and governors.  In the last three weeks, I’ve sent senior officials into nine states to meet with governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the state, including hospital administrators, et cetera.
My administration currently has zero unfilled requests for — unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the governors.  No governor needs anything right now, and we think we’ll have it that way until the end, because, frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go.
We have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that’s helping us greatly.  I want to thank them very much.  The military has been fantastic.
We’re closely monitoring hospital capacity in these states.  Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures.  So hospitals are open for elective surgeries.
We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need.  All of the governors we’ve spoken with say they have enough bed capacity.  That’s a great thing.  Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators.
And a permanent shutdown was really never an option.  In terms of what we’re doing right now, this would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences.  There are consequences to shutdowns.
And we’ve saved, potentially, millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown, but now we’re very aware of this disease.  We understand the disease, to a large extent.  Nobody is going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we’ll end up with a cure, we’ll end up with therapeutics, we’ll end up with a vaccine very soon — all three.
We’re instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene — wash your hands every chance you get — while sheltering high-risk populations.  We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.  Be safe and be smart.
We’re surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases.  This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the South.  We’re being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes, because you know all of the problems that we’ve had with so many people — so sadly, they were infected — so that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else.  That’s really the high-risk people — the high-risk, wonderful people.
Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference.  Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic but to end it.  We want to get rid of it as soon as we can.  That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority.
Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month.  This was achieved in record time.  It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now.  Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks, and we’re mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately.
And logistically, we have the military ready to go.  We have great people — logistic, military people.  A wonderful general who’s waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time.  That’s what’s going to happen.  So our military is all set to go.  We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is that’s necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all.
And I’ll take a few questions if you’d like.
I will say this: I want to thank all of the staff — the White House staff, all of the doctors that we’ve been working with so closely.  And just a lot of very positive things are happening.  It’s a nasty, horrible disease that should’ve never been allowed to escape China, but it did.  And it infected the world, and the world is suffering.  But we’re going to get it taken care of, and we’re helping lots of other countries.

11:16 A.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good morning, everyone.  By any objective standard, the violence, chaos, and anarchy in Portland is unacceptable, yet Democrats continue to put politics above peace while this President seeks to restore law and order.
Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat — Governor of Oregon — said that the President should, quote, “stop playing politics,” called law enforcement officers “secret police,” and likened it to, quote, a “dictatorship.”  The governor also called on the president to get his officers off the streets.
Democrat mayor of Portland, Todd Wheeler, said the President is “trying to look strong for his base” while you had Democrats on the Hill, Nancy Pelosi, calling these officers stormtroopers and Jim Clyburn calling them the Gestapo.
This rhetoric is unhelpful and gives the violence we have seen a pass.  But President Trump will not give the violence a pass.  He will restore order where the Democrat governor and the Democrat mayor are unwilling to admit that they have lost control of their city.
The well-organized mob in Portland has become increasingly aggressive, especially against law enforcement officers. Individuals have thrown bricks, chunks of concrete, glass bottles, feces, balloons filled with paint, pig’s feet, slingshots to hurl ball bearings and batteries at federal agents and the courthouse.
Multiple attempts to barricade officers in the Hatfield Courthouse have occurred; attempts to start the structure on fire as well.  Use of eyesight-damaging laser devices have been used, and strobe lights against federal agents as well.  But according to Speaker Pelosi, when asked about the violent removal of statues, “people will do what they do.”
The Trump administration urges state and local officials to work cooperatively to restore law and order.  Operation LeGend is a great example of this.  At the governor’s request, we went into Kansas City and surged the area with federal assets — FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals.  This was named after LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old young boy who lost his life and was shot in his bed tragically.
This has been a successful operation that has been waged in his name, including the arrest of wanted fugitives.  Similarly, President Trump is taking action in Portland, even though you have a Democrat mayor and Democrat governor unwilling to work with us in this situation.  We are surging resources, along with Secretary Wolf at DHS, and augmenting the Federal Protective Service to safeguard federal property.
The bottom line is that this President stands with law and order, which leads to peace.  And we will not allow Portland to become the new CHOP, like what we saw in Seattle.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

2:30 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This afternoon, President Trump will deliver remarks on rolling back regulations to help all Americans.  Deregulation has been a top priority of this President.  The President reversed the disastrous over-regulation of the Obama-Biden administration.  Under President Trump, seven deregulatory actions have been taken for every one new regulation.  This amounted to $50 billion in regulatory cost savings.
And it is important to note that this deregu- — deregulation agenda lowers costs for every American.  The cost of these burdensome regulations fall disproportionately and benefit disproportionately lower-income Americans.  So this President took action to roll back the burdensome regulations that harm low-income communities and make sure that these lower-income Americans are taken care of.
For example, the President’s deregulatory agenda will boost household income by $3,100 annually.  Thanks to President Trump’s rolling back of the Obama-Biden-era CAFE standards, family — families will have access to cheaper cars.  The President’s healthcare deregulation will also save patients nearly 10 percent on prescription drug costs.
These real wins for the American people will disappear with a re-regulation agenda, which is why President Trump will continue to pursue his historic deregulatory activity.
On another note: We saw encouraging news yesterday on vaccines.  Moderna’s vaccine candidate is showing promising signs.  They produced a positive, neutral immune response among the 45 participants in the study.  This is comparable to what we see in recovered patients.  And the bottom line is that, so far, we are seeing exactly what you would hope to see in a vaccine.   They’re expected — the Moderna vaccine in particular is expected to reach phase three by late July, with 30,000 participants
And finally, on the therapeutics front, I just want to note: A very encouraging Regeneron contract.  A $450 million contract for a monoclonal antibody cocktail.  This is a bioengineered version of convalescent plasma, one of the several therapeutics available to treat COVID.  It can be used for prophylaxis and treatment.  And they say they could have up to 70 to 300 thousand doses — vials of this by the end of the summer or early fall.
So Operation Warp Speed continues.  We continue to see encouraging news on the therapeutics front.  And with that, I will take your questions.

Baton Rouge, Louisiana

3:00 P.M. CDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’ve had a very productive day.  I want to thank Governor John Bel Edwards for the briefings that we received today.  I also want to thank — I want to thank the entire team here at LSU for the hospitality.  We — it’s exciting to be in Tiger Stadium, but it’s inspiring to be on a campus and in a state that are making plans not just to open up the economy again, but to open up our schools again.  And we’re, we’re truly grateful — truly grateful for the time and the opportunity.
President Trump asked me to be here to send a very clear message to the people of Louisiana: That we’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you until we put this coronavirus completely in the past and we open up this economy, open up our schools, and we move this state and this nation forward bigger and better than ever before.
I’m particularly, as I said, grateful for Governor John Bel Edwards for the partnership that we’ve enjoyed over the past four months.  Louisiana is really in a unique position.  As we’ve seen rising cases across the Sun Belt, it was here in Louisiana that the people of this state, your state leadership, your healthcare workers have already demonstrated that people of Louisiana know how to slow the spread.  They know how to flatten the curve.  They did it before, and we’re very confident Louisiana is going to do it again, as we see rising cases now across the state.
I also want to express appreciation to Senator Bill Cassidy and Senator John Kennedy for their strong support.  The CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program, the direct support for families would not have been possible without their stalwart support in the United States Senate.
Let me also say how grateful we are to Louisiana’s House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise, for his great leadership, as well as other members of the delegation who have joined us for all of our discussions today: Congressman Garret Graves, Congressman Ralph Abraham, and Congressman Mike Johnson.
The people of Louisiana would be proud.  And President Trump and I are truly grateful for the spirit of partnership with your elected representatives in Washington, D.C., but also with your governor and with this administration.  It has — it has truly been inspiring, and we’re going to continue that partnership every day until — until we put this coronavirus in the past.
Let me be clear: The rising cases across the Sun Belt are serious, and we are going to continue to ensure that Louisiana and all of the affected states have the testing, the personal protective equipment, and the medicines to save lives, to slow the spread.
But while the rise in cases is serious, the people of this state and this nation deserve to know that our ability to respond to this pandemic is substantially better than two and three months ago, when the coronavirus first came to Louisiana.
Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, thanks to the strong partnership we forged with your governor, the support of these members of the Senate and the House, and the extraordinary healthcare workers here in Louisiana and all across this country, we are in a much stronger position to save lives, to protect the most vulnerable, to flatten the curve, and to continue to open up Louisiana and open up America.
Today, we had particular focus on education.  And as I said, being here at the LSU campus, we’re — we’re grateful for the innovative efforts that LSU and that Louisiana, broadly, are taking to open up our schools.
As President Trump has made it clear, as we — to open up America, we got to open up America’s schools.  We believe it’s absolutely in the best interest of students academically and in terms of every aspect of their personal wellbeing to get kids back in the classroom in K-12, and to get students back on campuses, like LSU.
And as we told the faculty here at this great campus, and we assured the governor today, we’re going to continue to make the testing and the PPE and the supplies available to support the reopening of schools all across this state and all across this country.
We’re also going to continue to scale supplies to meet this moment in Louisiana and beyond.  And in just the last several days, the Administrator of FEMA, Pete Gaynor, was here in Louisiana.  He’ll be visiting a local school, I’m told, with Congressman Scalise tomorrow.
This week alone, at the President’s direction, FEMA has deployed military medical personnel to some of the states most impacted.  And we learned today that Louisiana will be making a request for medical personnel, much like those we provided to Louisiana earlier in this pandemic.  And we’ll be moving quickly to respond to that.
We’ve been distributing medicines like remdesivir.  We’ve deployed 19 HHS teams to metropolitan areas around the country impacted by this pandemic.  There’ll be eight more teams deployed in the next several days.  And we’ve been expanding testing and the supplies that support testing.
At the present moment, with the great work of Admiral Brett Giroir, as a member of our task force, we’ve performed more than 40 million tests nationwide, more than — there was a day in just the last week when we actually performed over 800,000 desks [sic] — tests in a single day.  And we’re — we’re incredibly inspired by Louisiana’s innovation from very early on in expanding testing — well above the national average, and we’ll continue to support efforts in that regard.
Also, we were pleased to announce that we were unveiling three different surge testing sites in states around the country.  One includes four locations in Baton Rouge, including LSU’s Alex Box Stadium.  It’ll be for those with symptoms or those who believe they’ve been exposed.  And we’ll be doing a quick turnaround on testing.  This is part of our community testing and surveillance efforts.  And we’ve already deployed those personnel and resources here in Louisiana.
There’s one announcement we informed governors yesterday of that I want to ask Seema Verma, the administrator of the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and Admiral Giroir to step to the podium to describe.  We’ve often said the first mission of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, at the President’s direction, was to save lives.  Our mission today is to save lives, to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable, to open up America and open up America’s schools.
But one of the ways that we protect the most vulnerable is by ensuring, as you’ve done so here in Louisiana, to make sure that those who live in long-term care and nursing home facilities have the testing and the PPE support.  And we have a very significant announcement about the deployment of testing resources to our nursing homes, and I’d like to invite my colleagues on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to step forward and describe it.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  You know, from day one, as the Vice President said, we’ve had a focus on protecting the most vulnerable citizens, and that includes our nursing home residents.  And it’s been a very difficult time for them — restriction of visitors, restriction of activities.  But today’s announcement about providing point-of-care tests in every nursing home across the country is very significant.
This is going to allow our nursing homes to test their workers on a weekly basis and also test their patients as well.  And this is important because when they identify a patient that could be potentially — that is infected with the coronavirus or even a staff member, it allows them to do the important work around isolating that patient.  And this is also a significant step forward in reuniting patients with their families, because once we know that the facility is free of the coronavirus, it allows visitors to also come back in.  So this is a very important step.
And thanks to Dr. Giroir for his efforts to make this happen.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, Administrator Verma.  As a native of Louisiana, it’s always great to be back here, and I really feel just wonderful being here in Tiger Stadium.  I did want to say, by any measure, Louisiana, in terms of testing, is in the top 10 states nationally.  And by a couple of measures, they’re either number one or number two — not quite good enough for Coach O, but you’re going to be there very soon.  (Laughter.)
The announcement today is really significant, and let me amplify on Administrator Verma.  It’s very important to protect our vulnerable.  And we know that our elderly in nursing homes are among the most vulnerable, and that’s why we’ve leaned in so heavily with them.  In order to protect them, we recommend that the staff be tested once a week to make sure that they don’t bring, unintentionally, maybe even without symptoms, the virus into the nursing home.  That means 4 to 5 million tests per month.  And, as you know, the turnaround times — because there’s so much testing — is getting a bit longer, and it’s also very expensive.
What we’re talking about today is providing a point of care — that means a rapid, on-the-spot, 20-tests-per-hour instrument, along with tests, to every single of the 15,400 nursing homes within this country.  We’re starting next week with 2,000 of them, ranked by Administrator Verma and her team, that are at risk because of spread in the community.  Seventeen of those are right here in Baton Rouge.  We’re going to start that next week.  This is a very, very significant moment to protect our seniors.  Over the following ensuing weeks, we’re going to distribute to all the rest of the 13,400.
Just to make one comment: This is not an acquisition.  It’s not just writing a check and doing it.  This has been the culmination of about two months of work to develop the technology; to increase the sensitivity of the tests to make sure they’ll be highly protective of investments in manufacturing, in regulatory flexibility with the FDA; to bring it all together; and then, as part of a comprehensive plan, to protect our seniors.
So, I tell you, in the last two and a half years, I’ve been very honored to be a part of a lot of efforts of this administration.  I can tell you this one is going to save thousands of lives.  So this is a really historic moment.  It’s a great moment for our seniors and for those 17 nursing homes in Baton Rouge who will be getting it next week.  All hands on deck.  We’re here to support you.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
So before I turn it over to the governor, let me just — let me just say on behalf of the President and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, that: Governor Edwards, we support your efforts here in Louisiana to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable, to keep opening up your economy and opening up your schools.
But it’s important to remember we all have a role to play, so we want to encourage all the people of Louisiana and all those looking on to continue to adhere to the guidance of your state and local health officials.  Put into practice those commonsense steps that flattened the curve here in Louisiana before and will slow the spread and flatten the curve again: wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask.  Wear a mask whenever state and local authorities say it’s indicated or whenever social distancing is not possible.
Each and every one of us has a role to play.  And we’ll be able to continue to open up.  Now, Governor, I know you have made a decision to pause reopening, to stay at phase two, and we support your decision in that regard.  We’ll continue to flow testing and PPE and resources to support the implementation of your policy.
But I want to assure everyone in Louisiana and all those looking on that we’re opening up America again, and we’re dealing with rising cases across the Sun Belt.  It’s not either/ or.  We don’t have to choose between continuing to open up our economy, making plans to open up our schools, and doing what each and every one of us needs to do to slow the spread and flatten the curve.  Here in Louisiana, you did it before, and we’re very confident that you will do it again.  Because here in Louisiana, you know what the American people know: is that we’re all in this together.
I read a — I read a verse in my devotions this morning that we’re called to run the race marked out for us with endurance and with faith.  And I’m confident that with the endurance, the perseverance, and the faith of the people of this great state and this nation, that we’ll every day be one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past.
And we pledge to continue to work with your governor, with your leaders in Washington, D.C., and with all the great healthcare workers of this state to hasten that day.
Governor?
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I want to thank you for visiting Baton Rouge and Louisiana and bringing Ambassador Birx and Administrator Verma with you, as well as Secretary DeVos and Admiral Giroir.  And I want to thank our congressional delegation.
You know, talking about how we’re number one or number two, and so forth, in testing, I will tell you: It wouldn’t be possible without the support we’ve received from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
And I will tell you that, this week, we will exceed a million tests that we’ve conducted since the beginning.  We’re at 248,000 tests, to date, for the month of July, and that’s less than halfway through the month.  And that’s critically important.  But what the tests are telling us is we have more cases, we have rising positivity, and certainly we know from our hospitals that we have increasing hospitalizations as well.
And my commitment to the Vice President is the same as it is to the people of Louisiana: We’re going to do what’s required to get back in front of this virus and flatten the curve again, and make sure that we are protecting the most vulnerable, that we are saving lives.  And the way that we can reopen our economy, reopen our schools are to do those things that are essential to make sure that we can be successful.  And it’s — it’s really pretty simple at this point.
We don’t want to go backwards to phase one or to phase zero.  So we can — we can continue in phase two, but we are going to have to make sure that we wear the mask, that we social distance, that we limit our social gatherings in terms of the number of people.  And if we will do that, we’re going to be successful, and we don’t have to go — to go back.  And we are going to open our schools and so forth.
And everything we’re going to do, we’re going to do in consultation with the CDC guidelines, the guidance that’s put out by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and certainly working with our own professionals here at the Office of Public Health.  And we’re going to work with all of our local officials and the health community here, because they have been the true heroes.
And we’re going to be successful.  We are going to get back on top of this.  We’re going to flatten the curve.  And we look forward to the day, as the Vice President mentioned — he and President Trump are working — that we put this virus behind us.  And we’re going to work extremely hard.
And, please, Mr. Vice President, know we appreciate your visit.  I appreciate the attention you’ve paid to this state, to the time that you’ve given personally to speak with me anytime that I called, and for all of the assistance that we have received.  Our state is much better off today because of that assistance and because of your work and the work of your task force and our congressional delegation.
And while I know we have a lot of work to do ahead of us, I am optimistic that we’re going to get it done, and we’re going to come through this in fine fashion.  And I’m also praying for that result as well.  I believe in prayer, and I believe in work, and we’re going to do both here in Louisiana because that’s what we’ve done as long as we’ve been a state.
So I want to thank you again for being here.  And I believe, at this point, we’re going to hear from our senior —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible.)  Dr. Birx.
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  I’m sorry.  Dr. Birx.  I was going to say senior citizen, but she’s not a senior citizen.  (Laughter.)
DR. BIRX:  No, you had that right.
GOVERNOR EDWARDS:  Thank you very much, Ambassador.
DR. BIRX:  You had that right, Governor.  Thank you, governor.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you to our senators, our congressional members here today.  And thank you to Courtney Phillips and her public health team.
The epidemic you’re facing today in Louisiana is different than the epidemic that you had in March and April that was very much centered in New Orleans and a little bit in Baton Rouge.
This particular epidemic, although the cases are still low, is spread across the state of Louisiana.  And that’s why the Governor is correct: It will take everyone in Louisiana, every single person in Louisiana, to wear a mask.  It will take all of those residents to social distance, to practice personal hygiene.
And as Coach O has explained to me, he was able to keep his football players safe and healthy and well here, and tested, until some might have wandered off to a bar.  And after wandering off to a bar, they did become positive.  And so he’s made it clear that that is not on, any longer, the itinerary for practice.
And so we are really calling on all Louisianans to not be going to bars, not to be even going to bars in people’s houses.  Social gathering of more than 10 people right now is particularly difficult with the type of spread that you have.  But it is this public health group and this governor who was able to stop a very serious epidemic in New Orleans.
And it’s why these cases are still low that we have the opportunity to change the future for Louisiana and be able to decrease the number of cases every day if each of us wear our masks, stay out of bars, make sure you don’t have large gatherings in your households, and really protect one another, and do what we always have said: protecting the most vulnerable in all age groups that may have comorbidities because of their higher risk of severe disease.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
SENATOR CASSIDY:  I will speak as a physician who happens to be a doctor.  And I compliment — one, I thank you all for being here.  I compliment you for recognizing that this is a public health crisis, which has led to an educational crisis, which has led to an economic crisis, which has led to an employment crisis, a family crisis, if you will.  And we only get out of the economic, the educational, the employment, the family crisis if we do something about the public health crisis.
Now, there’s a lot to be said about that, but I’ll just give the local inflection today that I was particularly proud of: LSU and Southern spoke about their partnership, about how they would wish to safely reopen their schools so their children — the students can come back and graduate, but not just that: recognizing that some of the risk factors for having a worse episode of coronavirus infection — the obesity, diabetes, hypertension, minority race — are represented in our state.
We have the ability to not only keep our state healthier, but to learn lessons that will benefit the rest of the nation and the rest of the world.  And that will be our unique contribution to unraveling the public health crisis, which therefore makes the education, the employment, the employer, and all other aspects of this that much better.
So again, Mr. Vice President and your team: Thank you for coming.  And we, in Louisiana, just look forward to working with you for those solutions.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator.
SENATOR KENNEDY:  As I have said repeatedly today, Vice President Pence has been a powerful partner to President Trump, and he honors us with his presence today, as do — as does each member of his entire team.  I’ve gotten to know Mike Pence well.  He has been a rock, and he has been a rockstar for the American people.
Second and final point: Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Austria, South Korea, Japan, even Vietnam, for God’s sakes, have opened their schools, and they’ve done so safely.  And so can America and so should America.
We have lost 30 precious lives to the coronavirus of kids under the age of 15, and that is 30 too many.  But the point is: Our kids don’t seem to be as susceptible to the virus as adults.  If we used our head, we can open our schools safely.  I can promise you that not opening our schools will do our children so much more harm than the coronavirus ever can.
In Louisiana, for many of our children, our schools are the most stable things in their lives, and that’s what we need to work hard on every single day.
Finally, our universities can help us.  All of our universities in Louisiana are going to be open this fall.  Our public labs have done a wonderful job.  Our private labs have done a wonderful job.  Many of our university labs have done a wonderful job.  But I’m going to challenge our universities today, right here in Louisiana and elsewhere: Step up to the plate.  Help us do more testing.  That’ll get — help us get elementary and secondary education back on its feet.
Once again, thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to your entire team.  And to the governor, I want to thank all of them for giving so much to Louisiana and to America.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Please, Congressman.
REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE:  Well, I want to really welcome Vice President Mike Pence to Tiger Stadium.  As an Indiana Hoosier, we appreciate that he’s come here today.  But Vice President Pence has been here every time we’ve needed him.  The Trump administration, top down, every time there’s been — whether it’s a shortage of PPE, additional relief packages — the Trump administration and this task force led by Vice President Pence have been nonstop working to make sure that we have the things that we need to continue to confront this pandemic.
It’s still out there, but we also know that we’ve got to start safely reopening, as Governor Edwards has led the way to show that we can open our schools; that we have to open our schools.  It’s not a question of whether or not the schools will reopen; it’s how best to safely reopen.
And today’s roundtable was really informative, as we saw the heads of the LSU system, the Southern System, student body president representing the University of Louisiana system talking about the importance of safely reopening schools.  It’s got to be our challenge to ensure that we’re there for our kids to make sure that they can go back to school and they can go back in a safe way.  It’s not the same thing to be taught at home.
Not only do they need that instruction, but we’ve seen psychiatrists giving studies, we’ve seen pediatrics studies that have shown the damage it causes to our kids not being in school.  So it’s our challenge to make sure that we put the protocols out there to safely reopen.  And I appreciate Vice President Pence’s leadership in doing that.
And I also want to thank the Vice President and his whole team.  Of course, Admiral Giroir, good to see you back here in Louisiana, but you’re doing a great service to our nation.  And CMS Administrator Seema Verma — what they just announced today, don’t underestimate how important that is.  When you look at the crisis and the deaths: Over 40 percent of America’s deaths from coronavirus have happened to seniors in nursing homes.  They represent less than 1 percent of America’s population, yet account for over 40 percent of the deaths.  And as we’ve dug into the data to find out who to protect and how best to protect people all across the country, we know the most vulnerable.  And the fact that they’re going to be putting these testing facilities into every nursing home in America is a revolutionary breakthrough.
What you’ve done with Operation Warp Speed to find cures, to find vaccines, the testing that’s being done today, and the red tape that’s being removed by agencies like the FDA, I can’t thank President Trump and Vice President Pence enough for their efforts to lead us through this so that we ultimately find a vaccine, find a cure.  But in the meantime — and, by the way, over 70,000 vials of remdesivir that have been allocated to Louisiana from the National Stockpile; thank you for that, Mr. Vice President — but we’re going to continue working at warp speed to address this.
But it’s critical that we reopen our schools, and I appreciate the conversation we had here today to get that done, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Steve.  And before we go to questions, I’d like the Secretary of Education, Secretary Betsy DeVos, to step forward.  She has literally been traveling the country, working with states and school systems around America to get our kids back in the classroom.
Madam Secretary.
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you so much for convening us here today, for your and President Trump’s leadership during this time.  I will just reflect again what so many have said up here in the last few moments: that our kids have got to get back to school.  And it’s not a matter of if; it’s just a matter of how.
There are so many ways that we can think outside of the box how to address specific needs.  But as — as has been noted, the question of a child’s health is a multi-dimensional one.  And we know that too many kids today have been harmed by being at home these last several months.  Their mental wellbeing, their social-emotional growth, and particularly those that are most vulnerable among us have been harmed by not being able to continue their learning and continue to be in classrooms with their teachers and their peers.
So I know that Americans are a people of great determination and action and can-do spirit.  And this is a great opportunity for adults to step up and show and demonstrate and model grit and determination to ensure that kids can continue their learning come fall.  And I and my team and, I know, this whole administration stands ready to help and support in every way we possibly can.  And we look forward to all of the creative solutions that we’re going to see across this country.
So, thank you again, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of this task force and your and the President’s continued commitment to the future of this nation.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Madam Secretary.  With that, questions.  We’ve got time for a few questions before we have to go.
Go ahead.  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-baton-rouge-la/

1:25 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  President Trump will participate in a roundtable to hear stories of families positively impacted by law enforcement.  That will be taking place shortly after this briefing concludes.  The President stands with our police officers, our men and women across this country who valiantly patrol our streets and protect our protect our citizenry.
This President stands on the side of law and order to secure peace in our streets.  That has always been his priority, and remains so today.
Tragically, this weekend, we saw a devastating ambush attack against brave law enforcement officers in McAllen, Texas: Officer Edelmiro Garza, Jr., who was 45 years old, and Officer Ismael Chavez, who was 39 years old.  And while responding to a domestic disturbance call, Officers Garza and Chavez arrived on scene to protect the people that they serve.  They were met with gunfire.  They were ambushed by a violent and dangerous suspect who horrifically shot before they even drew their weapon or had a chance to call for backup.
We honor the lives and the service of Officer Garza and Officer Chavez.  This President will always stand on the side of law enforcement and the heroes who protect and serve.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

2:05 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  There has been no greater champion for rectifying racial and income disparities in America’s educational system than President Trump.
Every child regardless of race, income level, or zip code deserves an equal playing field of opportunity to access the American Dream.  Making that goal a reality begins in our schools.  The evidence is clear: An analysis of 41 major urban areas found that black and Hispanic students made the largest gains in educational access because of school choice, according to a CREDO study.
That is why President Trump has been clear in saying in his State of the Union: “For too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools.  To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships.  The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.”  Now I go — “I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity…Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act,” he said, “because no parents should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.”
Well, now, if Democrats have their way, children will not have access to schools at all.  And that is not acceptable to President Trump.  President Trump continues to fight for equal opportunity in our schools by boldly and firmly underscoring the absolute necessity of America’s schools to reopen this fall.  The data is clear: Sustained school closures hurt students who have fewer resources the most.
McKinsey and Co. created these models — I have some graphs for you — to estimate the potential impact of school closures, and they found this, quote: “How much learning students lose during school closures vary significantly by access to remote learning, the quality of remote instruction, home support, and the degree of engagement.”
As you can see in this chart, students who experience average-quality remote learning progress, but at a slower pace; students who are getting lower-quality remote learning stagnate at current grade levels; and students who are not getting instruction at home lose significant ground with some students dropping out altogether.
As you can see in the three scenarios mapped on this graph, if students return to school in the fall, the disparities are far less than if they return in January of next year or the fall of next year, where disparities and learning are enormous.
But school closures affect more than just learning.  As the NAACP has pointed out, “For students of color at all levels across the country, school closings create problems even more urgent than the interruption of their educations.  Schools also serve as a community nexus for food and for housing.”
Rest assured that President Trump knows more than anyone the importance of opening our schools, which is why he has been the most vocal advocate for reopening.  And President Trump’s America — make no mistake that he will continue to be the biggest fighter for equal opportunity in our schools and continued access to the American Dream for all.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-9-2020/

4:37 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Good afternoon.  Today, President Trump welcomed to the White House President López Obrador of Mexico.  The meeting reaffirmed the incredibly strong ties between President Obrador and President Trump.  The leaders noted that many people have bet against their ability to work together in a strong and productive fashion.  But rest assured, they work together, and they work together well.  The U.S.-Mexico relationship has never been stronger or more productive, thanks to the leadership of President Trump.
The USMCA, in particular, is a major win for our two countries and for America’s workers.  Under the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement, more than 4 million man — manu- — excuse me, more than 4 million manufacturing jobs will be regained that were lost under NAFTA.  This will be a huge influx of American jobs that were lost under the failed NAFTA trade deal that went into effect.
In addition, tens of thousands of manufacturing plants were lost because of NAFTA; we want to bring those on shore.  And the USMCA will go a long way in bringing back those manufacturing plants and those millions of jobs that were lost under NAFTA.
NAFTA was a bad deal for the American worker because it left American workers behind.  Many politicians forgot the damage wrought by disastrous trade deals such as NAFTA, but President Trump did not forget.  It took this President to change the status quo, renegotiate NAFTA, and secure a better deal for the American worker.
And here’s why: The USMCA alone will create 176,000 American jobs.  We believe the other trade deals that this President has negotiated will add to that number and help undo a lot of what NAFTA has done.  The USMCA will boost American manufacturing, including wages, new jobs, and exports.  And the USMCA will create 76,000 auto manufacturing jobs, crucial to the wellbeing of this country.
The USMCA is good for business, as President Trump rebuilds the strongest, most inclusive economy in history.  The USMCA will help jumpstart our economy.  The USMCA is projected to increase GDP by $235 billion.  This means jobs, jobs, jobs.
And during today’s meeting between the presidents, one official from Mexico noted that many considered the USMCA an 80/20 probability.  Now, it is 100 percent certainty.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-7-8-2020/

698,Trump,2020-07-08 06:41:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force | July 8, 2020",Nan,"Department of Education
Washington, D.C.
11:41 A.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good morning all.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, here at the Department of Education, as part of our ongoing effort to focus on a mission to save lives, meet the needs of our states and our healthcare workers, to protect the vulnerable, and to safely reopen America and reopen America’s schools.
As you will hear today from Admiral Brett Giroir, at this point, we have tested more than 39 million Americans.  Among those, more than 3 million Americans have tested positive and more than 1.3 million Americans have recovered.  Sadly, more than 133,000 Americans have lost their lives, and our sympathies are with all of the impacted families.
And while we mourn with those who mourn, because of what the American people have done, because of the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers around the country, we are encouraged that the average fatality rate continues to be low and steady.  And at days earlier this week, it was actually 90 percent lower than at the height of this pandemic.
Again, it’s a credit to the sacrifices the American people have made, to the extraordinary work that our healthcare workers are doing.  And we pledge that this task force, working in partnership with governors all across the country, is going to continue to work our hearts out 24 hours a day to continue to keep our losses low.
In just a few moments, Dr. Deborah Birx will outline the data that we’re seeing around the country.  We’re tracking literally state by state, county by county.  But as she will describe in a moment, we’re actually seeing early indications of a percent of positive testing flattening in Arizona and Florida and Texas.  Governors in each of those states have taken strong steps to flatten the curve.  And again, as Dr. Birx will describe, we’re beginning to see early indications that positivity is flattening, and in Arizona and Florida, we’re beginning to see declining numbers of emergency room visits as well.
We believe the takeaway from this for every American, particularly in those states that are impacted, is: Keep doing what you’re doing, because we’re starting to see the first indications that as we were able to do in the Northeast, as we were able to do in New Orleans and Louisiana and Michigan and other places around the country, we’re putting into practice those mitigation efforts and we’re beginning to see indications that they are having a good effect.
We are focused on the states where more than half of the new cases have arisen — Texas, Arizona, Florida, and California — and have received encouraging reports even through this morning: strong supplies of PPE in hospitals; hospital capacity remains strong.
The one need that we did hear from governors across the region is for personnel.  And over the last week, working through FEMA, the Department of Defense, and HHS, we’ve been processing requests to deploy over 1,070 doctors and nurses and medical personnel.  At this point, roughly 525 doctors and nurses are on the ground in Arizona, California, and Texas, and we’re processing a request from Florida for an additional amount.
We’ve made it very clear as we — if you’ll recall, we deployed, at the President’s direction, active-duty military medical personnel to New York, to New Jersey, to Connecticut, to Michigan, to Louisiana, and we’re in the process of doing that again just to make sure that those dedicated doctors and nurses and healthcare workers have the relief that they need as we see cases rising in various communities across the Sun Belt.  And we’ll continue to work that.
We had a conference call yesterday with the nation’s governors.  We are in the process of continuing to send, every week, detailed county-by-county summaries, analysis, and recommendations to governors that are being — that are being implemented and well received.
We also are issuing renewed guidance on preservation and reuse of PPE.  Again, what we’re hearing, in not just speaking to governors but talking directly to hospitals, is that, frankly, because of the historic effort that President Trump implemented to spin up hundreds of millions of supplies of gloves and masks and face shields and — as well as the construction of ventilators — we now have 59,000 ventilators in our supplies — PPE, we hear, remains very strong, but we’re encouraging healthcare workers to begin now to use some of the best practices that we learned in other parts of the country to preserve and to reuse the PPE supplies.
So our focus is to make sure our states have everything they need, when they need it.  And we’re working closely with all the governors to make that a reality.  But what brings us to the Department of Education is, as we — as we see to the needs of our states and we focus on the healthcare of the American people, we’re working to reopen America and to reopen America’s schools.
And yesterday, President Trump convened a summit of education leaders and health officials at the White House.  And as the President made clear yesterday: It’s time.  It’s time for us to get our kids back to school.  And the summit yesterday gave us an opportunity to outline and to learn what we might be able to do then.
In just a few moments, I’m going to ask Secretary DeVos to talk about the approach the Department of Education is taking to assisting local communities and states in bringing their schools back online.  And also, we’ll hear from Dr. Bob Redfield, who has been literally, since early in this pandemic, providing guidance to schools and will be issuing additional guidance next week.
I wouldn’t want to pass the opportunity, though, not just as Vice President but as someone who’s been married to a school teacher now for 35 years, just to say — to say thank you to all the teachers out there.  From early in this pandemic, teachers learned how to do the distance teaching and did a remarkable job, oftentimes having to care for their own families and make sure their own children’s studies were happening.  So to all of our — America’s teachers, we say thank you.
We also want to say thank you to the parents — the parents who had to step in and become educators for all of their kids.  It’s really been remarkable when you see what our kids have been able to accomplish during this difficult time.
But what we heard again yesterday from education officials and what we heard from the American Academy of Pediatrics: It’s absolutely essential that we get our kids back into a classroom for in-person learning.  We can’t let our kids fall behind academically, but it’s important that the American people remember that for children that have mental health issues, for special needs children, for nutrition for children in communities facing persistent poverty, the school is the place where they receive all those services.
And so this is not just simply about making sure our kids are learning and they’re advancing academically, but for their mental health, for their wellbeing, for their physical health, for nutrition.  We got to get our kids back to school.
And as you heard the President yesterday and even again this morning, we’re absolutely determined to work in partnership with our states to give the guidance for states and communities to be able to safely reopen our schools.  The CDC will be issuing new guidance next week — part of a five-part series of recommendations that will give all-new tools to our schools.
But what Dr. Redfield made clear yesterday I’m sure he’ll make clear again today, is: We’re here to help.  We don’t want federal guidance to be a substitute for state and local laws and rules and guidance.  We’re here to assist with the shared objective that I think is shared by every parent in America, which is we want to get our kids back.  We want to get them back in the classroom.  We want to get our teachers back in the front of those classrooms.  We got to get our kids learning, in person, once again.
As Congress is still in recess but will gather again soon, we already are in discussions about additional potential support, although we were able to remind governors that $13.3 billion is available in the CARES Act for states, to be able to assist them as they roll out and restart schools across the country.
At the present moment, we learned yesterday that only 1.5 percent of those funds has been drawn down by states, and we encouraged the governors to take advantage of that.
Our objectives, as I said, are to save lives, meet the needs of our states and their healthcare workers, protect the most vulnerable, and safely reopen America, and safely reopen our schools.
And the good news is we are — we are reopening America.  The jobs report last Thursday spoke for itself: Nearly 5 million jobs created.  And I can tell you, evidence all around the country is that the American people are finding a way to do their part to put the health of their neighbors first, even while we all find a way to get back to work, to worship, and to school.
And we all have a role to play to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable, and to safely reopen our country and our schools.  And so I would just — I would just close, before I turn the podium over to Dr. Birx for her report, just simply to say thank you to the American people.  Thank you for what you’ve done so far.  Thank you for the way you’ve put the health and wellbeing of not just family members and friends, but strangers — people you didn’t even know — first.
And we just encourage you to keep doing what you’re doing:  Keep heeding the guidance of state and local authorities.  Practice good hygiene.  Wash your hands.  Wear a mask wherever state and local authorities determine it’s indicated, or wear a mask where you can’t engage in social distancing.
This is the role each of us can continue to play, and we’re seeing some early indications in some of the most impacted states that Americans are doing just that.  So we want to encourage you on and tell you that we’re going to continue to do our part.
And I’m just absolutely confident — just as we proved when this pandemic was striking so deeply in the Northeast, when it was striking in Louisiana and in Michigan — the American people know what needs to be done, and we know we can do it.
And we flattened — we flattened the curve before, we slowed the spread before, and we can do it again.  But we’ve got to all do our part, and we’ll do it together.
With that, Dr. Deborah Birx.  And then we’ll get a report from Admiral Giroir before we move on to other reports.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  If I could have the first slide, please.  And I know some of you do watch what I wear, so I’m wearing this specially today.  This came from the Salt River tribe.  I just want to — masks can be a fashion statement.
And I want to thank the Salt River tribe.  It was a real pleasure to be out and speaking to individuals around the United States about the issues that they’re facing with COVID-19, to be able to meet with communities, hospital personnel, African American communities, Hispanic communities, and our (inaudible) tribal nations.  That was a privilege last week.
I want to start with Arizona, just to pick up where the Vice President left off.  That orange line is the number of tests performed, and the blue line is the test positivity.  Now, this is at the level of the state.  And Arizona does have three counties that we’re tracking very closely, obviously you know that the largest one being Phoenix and Maricopa County.  But this does show that the blue line, which is a five-day — a seven-day average — and thank you to the data team for these wonderful slides — the five — the seven-day average is showing some flattening, and we find that encouraging.
Also equally encouraging at this point — because we know that the test-positivity rate is the first thing to increase, and we’re hoping that it heralds a stability in Arizona of at least reaching a plateau in their curve.
The red line represents the emergency room visits for any of the COVID-like symptoms.  And this is also an early indicator, and we find that encouraging.
The next slide does show the counties that we’re tracking.  Obviously, the largest county being Maricopa County with the largest number of infections, but clearly there’s issues in Yuma and Pima.
The Vice President mentioned the weekly reports that go to governors.  This is what the report looks like.  It (inaudible) their full-side pages.
This is Alaska’s.  On the front page is our interpretation of what we’re seeing, relevant to their epidemic, with specific recommendations related to where we see them, as far as being in a danger zone.  They are coded by yellow and red.  And it follows that they see everything you’re seeing on that first report in boxes — warning boxes — and then each of the counties are represented so that they have, in one place, five pages from the White House and task force that summarizes what we’re seeing.  And that goes out weekly.
Next slide, please.
This looks at Florida, and you can see, in the same way, the red line — early suggestions of decreasing emergency room visits for the symptoms of COVID and some stability starting in that blue line.  Hoping that heralds stability in the number of daily reported cases.
We also understand that we went through a holiday weekend, and holiday weekends can impact datas on both ends: underreporting through the weekend and then catch-up reporting on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after a holiday weekend.
Next slide.
This shows the counties of Florida that we’re tracking.  These are the top 10 counties in Florida, and you can see each of them have a different profile.
I want to call your attention to the counties that are across the bottom there that are more difficult to see.  Some of those represent Jacksonville and other large metros, including Tampa.  When the governor talks about how they were “steady and low” for a long period of time after reopening, this is where that is reflected for almost five weeks after reopening.  Clearly, there was something that happened though.  And those that we’re looking into across the board — because whatever happened in Florida happened across the Sun Belt, and that all of the curves and all of the findings are mirrored.
If you remember early on in March and April, we were talking about, first, the New York metro, followed by Boston, followed by Philadelphia, then Chicago — and New Orleans was with the New York metro.  And so it was a series of individual curves.
In this case, whatever occurred occurred almost simultaneously across the South.  And so we’re investigating that very closely to really see the etiology behind that because that can help us as an early warning signal, but also help us in guidance to the American people of what we’re asking them to do.
Next slide.
Texas.  And you can see Texas is in a similar situation with their blue line.  And we’re watching this very closely across Texas.
Next slide.
But I think all of you know that there is a series of major metros in Texas with significant increase in cases from Houston to Dallas to San Antonio to El Paso and McAllen area.  And so the governors get this type of report with specific recommendations.
And then, finally, California, where you can see — next slide, thank you — again, a long time of stability, but then this increase in the number of test positives and rapid increase in cases.
Next slide.
And you can see the majority of the issue is in the Los Angeles area, although we see this through Riverside, Imperial, Sacramento, and now San Francisco with increased number of cases.
So I want to finish with where the Vice President started: about the sacrifices of the American people.  Because in that recommendations are very clear recommendations that when you have a county with these types of cases, we are recommending everyone using a face covering.  And I think the studies now that have been done, showing that cotton face coverings work, that does open up the ability for us all to have individualized face coverings that express our personality.
But in addition, I think the work that these governors have done to — and ask the American people is it’s stop going to bars, to close the bars, to move to outdoor dining, to decrease indoor — any kind of indoor gatherings again.  To all of the Americans out there that are in these four states and the states that have — in the report, were in the red zone — because there’s a series of other states that we have in that zone — is really asking the American people in those counties and in those states — in those states to not only use the face coverings — not going to bars, not going to indoor dining — but really not gathering in homes either and decreasing those gatherings back down to our phase one recommendation, which was 10 or less.
So, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Admiral, report on testing.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Since we’re bragging on our face coverings, this was made by a small religious community in Pennsylvania, who were helped by the Public Health Service, and they hand sewed these for a lot of our officers to match our operational dress — those blue uniforms.  So, I wear this proudly, and I think of that community every single day — everybody pitching in across America to help us all.
So, in terms of testing, I want to cover three quick topics.  First one is just where we are numerically.  The Vice President has already said, we are now topping 39 million tests across the country.  The states really crushed their goal in June.  The state goals was about 12.9 million in June; CDC numbers have finalized that at about 16 and a half million tests for June.  So, congratulations to almost all of the states who made their goal and exceeded their goal.
We’re doing very well right now, between 6- and 700,000 tests per day.  We did top the 700,000 mark last week, and we’re averaging about 620-630,000 tests per day.  We continue to ship.  We are ripe with swabs and media.  So the states tell us what they need.  We work with them to set those goals, based on their state testing plans.
After technical assistance by the CDC and my office, FEMA ships those every week.  Now that’s along with ASPR — the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response — at HHS.  So that’s sort of the overall general view.
We announced, yesterday, what we talked about a little bit last week, and that is federal surge sites.  We opened these in three communities.  There was a list of communities identified by Dr. Birx and her team that had certain characteristics of their infection trend, but also met certain characteristics of numerical numbers in isolation that surge testing might have an impact over a short period of time.
So our goal, in those communities, is to do at least 5,000 tests per day.  And those are in Baton Rouge, Jacksonville, and McAllen — the McAllen in Texas.  And we have many other sites that we’re working with.  Again, this is a partnership with the state and local governments to make that happen.  They’re up and running and testing in all three sites.  Baton Rouge started yesterday, the other two sites start today, and we already have almost 6,500 appointments already made this morning.  So that’s going very, very well.
The last thing I wanted to talk about is Phoenix.  And I don’t know if we have the slides for this.  I get just a little bit concerned when I hear things in the news, like “we’re doing nothing for Phoenix” and “the federal government hasn’t been doing anything with Phoenix.”  Because that really is not correct, and it undermines a lot of the things that we’re doing.
I’m going to show you some slides.  I didn’t make these slides up.  My team — this was part of a 55-slide deck — 55-slides slide deck just on Phoenix, where we understand the demographics, the health disparities, the income levels, the racial and ethnicity backgrounds, where the tests are done, where the resources are.  This is how we really work the issues.
So, first of all, we’re in constant contact with Governor Ducey and his team.  His state health officials are outstanding.  We not only talk on the calls, but we have frequent calls.  And I know Dr. Redfield does this as well, and Ambassador Birx does this as well.
Number two, we provide support according to the state plans.  Just in the last two months, we’ve shipped over 500,000 swabs and media to the state to fulfill their plans.
In terms of Phoenix — if I can get the first slide back, please — I just want to say that, yes, we have lots of support in Phoenix.  This is the community-based testing locations.  I didn’t decode this because it’s right out of my slide deck.  Phoenix has three federally funded retail sites.  This is paid on a per-capita basis.  You come up and get a test.  These sites — not these three sites, but this overall program has tested just under a million individuals, and they’re located specifically in communities of high social vulnerability.  We have three there.
We also have 13 — what we call “3.0 sites.”  These are retail pharmacies that, because of our regulatory flexibility, they can do that without a federal stipend or grant.  They do this just through the insurance Medicare and Medicaid billing system.  So, those are 16 federal sites we have in Phoenix.
Next slide.
I don’t know if there’s a map to go with that, but under the leadership of Secretary Azar, we’ve really surged into FQHCs — Federally Qualified Health Centers.  This is where you really want testing to happen because these are medical homes for those who are indigent and underserved.  We have 28 FQHCs sites performing testing just in the Phoenix area right now.
Next slide.
We don’t have that slide, but let me talk about — we’ve also identified every single testing machine in Phoenix.  So there are testing machines to do tens of thousands of tests per day.  And we’re sending at least 100,000 — okay, maybe it’ll come up, maybe it won’t, but at least 100,000 assays to the Phoenix area every week.
So these are all the things we’re doing in the background, that happen on a regular basis, that we do community by community by community.
Now, two days ago, I heard that Mayor Gallego was unhappy because there was no federal support.  I heard that on Monday — on Monday morning.  I was on the phone with the FEMA representative in the afternoon.  It was clear to me that Phoenix was not in tune with all the things that the state were doing.  We convened a call last night, where we had Governor Ducey’s people on the phone, where we had the mayor’s people on the phone, where we had various health officials on the phone.  We got everybody together, understood where the gaps are.  There’s a surge from Arizona State.  There are a surge in testing sites that are state testing sites in Phoenix that are up there.
And this morning, Governor Ducey looked at everything, thought a surge site would be helpful in west Phoenix.  He requested that, and we’re contracting that right now.
So I just wanted to give you that example because it really pains me when somebody says the federal government isn’t doing anything, when we have 41 federal sites there.  We’re sending supplies, we’re sending tests.  And we work with the governor every day.  And if there’s an appropriate request and it’s on the list for Dr. Birx, which it was, we will send a surge site.  And that’s what we’re doing; we’re contracting that this afternoon.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good job, Brett.  Thank you, Admiral Giroir.
As we said, the focus today is on safely reopening our schools.  And as we discussed yesterday at the White House summit, from very early in this process, the Centers for Disease Control has been issuing guidance for schools and for childcare services, in early March — March the 12th, to be specific.  And when we first published the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” and encouraged people to engage in schooling from home, wherever possible, from that point forward, CDC has published decision trees about how schools can begin to develop reopening plans, and just last week, published new guidance for K-12 schools.
But next week, as Dr. Redfield can elaborate in a few moments, they’ll be issuing five new documents that’ll range from preparing communities to return to school safely, to decision-making tools for parents and caregivers, and to create symptom screening considerations as children and teachers return to school.
But as we made clear yesterday, we’ll make clear again today: We’re here to help.  And none of the CDC’s recommendations are intended to replace state and local rules and guidance; that what we’ve made clear to governors and to state and local health officials is CDC stands ready to work with local officials as they tailor their plan for reopening their schools.  But we’re all committed to getting our kids back in the classroom and getting them back in the classroom this fall.
With that, I want the Secretary of Education to reflect on the efforts she’s making here at the Department of Education, then we’ll hear from Dr. Redfield, and then a few wrap-up comments from Secretary of HHS before we go to questions.
Madam Secretary?
SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thanks, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President.  Thanks for hosting the task force here today.  We are so grateful to the President and to you for your leadership on doing what’s right for students.
Yesterday we had a really good and important conversation at the White House with local leaders and great teachers and parents.  It was insightful and inspiring.  And as Mrs. Pence noted, these past few months, parents have worn multiple hats.  They really are our unsung heroes, and I might add, as the Vice President noted, as are the teachers who were often playing dual roles as parents themselves and continuing to help their students learn.
She also said — Mrs. Pence also said that as we reopen businesses, restaurants, theaters in our country, we simply can’t leave out our schools, and that is so correct.  Students can and must continue to learn full-time.
I’ve been really inspired by the innovative teachers, schools, and their communities that have kept learning going through this past few months, and they’re getting ready to do it again this fall.
A couple of great examples in Harlem and the surrounding boroughs in New York: Success Academy moved to distance learning in one week, using multiple technology platforms.  Teachers there insisted on learning new materials, right along with their students.  The students were still graded.  They made sure all the students had the needed tech that they did not maybe have at home, initially.
Miami-Dade County used its existing instructional continuity plans to make a seamless transition to distance learning.  They added interventions for students who were struggling already before the pandemic.
The International Leadership Academy in Texas started from the mindset that not learning wasn’t an option for any student.  They delivered multilingual and special education curriculum to all of their students.  There were a number of schools and districts across the country that did an awesome job of transitioning this spring.  And there were a lot in which I and state school leaders were disappointed in that they didn’t figure out how to continue to serve their students.  Too many of them just gave up.
The Center for Reinventing Public Education said that only 10 percent across the board provided any kind of real curriculum and instruction program.
And, as I said, I’ve talked to all of the state school chiefs at least once, most of them more than once, and they’ve told me that while many of their districts in their states have done well through the past several months, a number of them, they were very disappointed in, in doing next to nothing.
And then we see as we talk about reopening schools, there are some creating false paradigms for the fall.  And here, right in our neighborhood, the D.C. area, Fairfax County, which is one of the most well-funded — I would call it an elite public school system in America — offered families a so-called “choice” for this fall: either zero days in school for their students or two days.  And their springtime attempt at distance learning was a disaster.  I have to — I give this as an example because things like this cannot happen again in the fall.  It would fail America’s students, and it would fail taxpayers who pay high taxes for their education.
Ultimately, it’s not a matter of “if” schools should reopen, it’s simply a matter of “how.”  They must fully open, and they must be fully operational.  And how that happens is best left to education and community leaders.
I really appreciate something that Secretary Azar reiterated yesterday at the White House.  It’s the Surgeon General’s prescription for healthcare, and I’m going to repeat it again because it bears repeating:
First, ask yourself what’s your individual circumstance.  Are you or is someone in your home vulnerable?  Second, what’s going on in your community?  Is the virus widespread or is it isolated?  And third, think about the kind of school activity that you’re talking — that you’re thinking about how to — how to accommodate and deal with.
What needs to be in place for things to be successful: Education leaders need to examine real data for their own states and communities and weigh the risks.  Local leaders in every community need to ask these questions and consider all the risks.  Physical health and safety are factors — so is mental health; so is social emotional development; and importantly, very importantly, so are lost opportunities for students, particularly the most vulnerable among us and students with disabilities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics noted: Keeping schools closed “places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.”  The Pediatrics guidance concluded that everyone “should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.”  “Fully open” and “fully operational” means that students need a full school year or more, and it’s expected it will look different depending on where you are.
What’s clear is that students and their families need more options.  I’ve talked a long time about the need to rethink education and the — to expand education options for all students.  This moment really demands action, and America always was, and is, and always will be a country of doers.
We are confident that with grit and determination and a measure of grace, we can and will do what’s right for all the students in our nation.  Thanks very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  First and foremost, I want to make it very, very clear that the guidance that CDC continues to put out for schools K-12 and higher learning is intentional for reopening and keeping our schools open.  That’s its purpose.  We recognize that there’s a variety of unique circumstances for different schools and different school districts, and so we’ve outlined a number of strategies that those schools, those administrators can use to accomplish this goal safely.
But I want to make it very clear that what is not the intent of CDC’s guidelines is to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed.  We’re prepared to work with each school, each jurisdiction to help them use the different strategies that we propose that help do this safely so they come up with the optimal strategy for those schools.
I think it’s critical — and it would be, personally, very disappointing to me and, I know, my agency — if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools.
I think there’s a series of different additional guidelines that we are about to put out to help, really, with the K-12 community, particularly at the community level, to help open safely.  Guidelines also that come out were consideration documents for parents and caregivers; guidelines for schools to help them understand how best to do symptom surveillance and characterize symptoms in the schools as a tool; and guidelines to really work out how — and the ins and outs of using face mask in the school setting; as well as, finally, some guidance and to help the schools have systems which they can monitor their programs.
But I want to close by just reiterating again: The purpose of CDC’s guidance is — remember, it’s guidance; it’s not requirements — and its purpose is to facilitate the reopening and the keeping open the schools in this country.  Because as the Vice President said, it is critical that we get these schools open and do it safely.  We’re prepared to work with all the school districts and schools to help them facilitate their development of their own unique plan to accomplish that.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Dr. Redfield.  Opening up schools is the right thing to do for our kids so they don’t fall behind academically and also so that children that are in need of services — special-needs children, children with mental health issues, nutrition needs — have the support that they receive at the schools.
It’s important, though, for parents and for working families.  And we — I asked Secretary Scalia to be here from the Department of Labor to speak about the impact on — as we put America back to work, making it possible for us to have single parents back in the workforce, it’s essential that we get our schools open as well.
And so I wanted Secretary Scalia, and then of course Secretary of HHS, to finish our remarks before we go to questions.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY SCALIA:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  It’s good to be with you all today.  For reasons that Secretary DeVos has mentioned and that the Vice President mentioned, of course, having our schools open is so important to our children’s education.  But as the Vice President has said, it’s very important as well to working men and women across the country who need to be able to structure their workdays in a predictable manner.   And the expectation that schools will be open and their children will be able to be in school so that the parents, in turn, can have a predictable schedule that they bring to the workplace, of course, that’s important to our business places as well.  And in that sense, it’s really critically important to our national reopening.
One study has suggested that if we closed all our schools and daycare for just a month — just, hypothetically, if we did that — the impact on U.S. productivity would be in the order of $50 billion.  That gives you some sense of the impact having our schools closed can have on our national recovery.
I did want to mention a couple of groups in particular to whom this is very important.  First: lower-wage workers.  One of the great triumphs of the economy that we enjoyed until the virus came was how well lower-income men and women were doing in the workplace.  We, as you know, had unemployment that tied a 50-year low.  We had record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and others.  And we had rising wages; wages actually rose about 15 percent for lower-income men and women during the first three years of this administration.
Unfortunately — and a number of people have observed this — it’s the lower-income workers who’ve been particularly adversely affected by some of the shutdowns that we’ve had in response to the coronavirus.
Unemployment among the lower-income workers has been higher than for other populations.  And therefore, for them, having schools reopen so that they can themselves have predictable schedules, be able to return to the workplace, is going to be very important.  They hold jobs that are less likely be jobs by which you can telecommute.  I think many of us know that, even telecommuting, there are burdens being placed on mothers, fathers who are getting up a little bit earlier or staying up a lot later to get work done, to plan around caring for their children in the interim.  But for lower-income men and women, that option often is not even available.
And then, second, let me comment briefly on working women, who — studies show and I think the experience of many of us reflects that it’s women in the household who quite often bear the larger burden when it comes to caring for children.  Studies show this.  And again, prior to COVID, another great success of the economy we were enjoying was the employment rate for women.  The unemployment rate for women was actually lower than for men, right before the virus came.  But unfortunately — and this is a statistic we’ve been tracking — we see that the unemployment rate for women now is higher than it is for men.
Now, we made great progress in June.  The Vice President mentioned the extraordinary jobs report.  We’ve put seven and a half million Americans back to work in just two months, and the unemployment rate for women dropped nearly 3 percent in June.
But still, we have important work to do, and we know that working women will have a harder time getting back to the workplace.  They continue to cite childcare at a much higher rate than men do as a reason that they’re not able to work.  And so for them, too, reopening our schools will be very important.
Look, just to wrap up — and it’s such an important sense the pace and structure of our national life is built around the expectation that our young people will be in school, in person, during the school year.  That’s so important for them, but it’s also vitally important for their parents, and in that sense, so critical to this reopening that is proceeding very well, economically.  But to keep going, we need our schools open in the fall.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Gene.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the President’s all-of-America approach to combatting the virus and for the focus that you’re now putting on getting our kids safely back to school.
From HHS’s perspective, reopening schools safely may be the single-most important thing that we can do to support healthy families during this pandemic.  All decisions about undertaking activities during COVID-19 have to look at risk as a continuum, not a binary question.  States and school districts can think about the same things that we urge individuals to think about.
As Secretary DeVos noted, our Surgeon General has come out with his “prescription for health.”  Ask yourself three critical questions: Where are you?  Is there significant community transmission of the virus in your area?  Whom are we talking about?  Children are much less susceptible to severe outcomes from the virus than adults.  And what activities are we looking at?
There are more and less risky activities for schools, like keeping kids in the same classroom versus changing classes, avoiding large gatherings, and doing activities outside whenever possible.  Reopening schools comes with some risk, but there are risks to keeping kids at home too.
At home, kids aren’t benefitting from social stimulation.  They may be falling behind with learning.  They may be more vulnerable to abuse that goes unreported by the mandatory reporters in our school system.  They may not be getting special services they may need.  They may not be getting the nutrition that they get at school.  And it may be difficult for parents to get back to work, as Secretary Scalia noted.
This issue, like so many considerations around safely reopening, isn’t about health versus the economy, but about health versus health.  All of this is why the American Academy of Pediatrics has strongly recommended beginning with the goal of having students physically present in school.  This goal is the right way to use the extensive guidance that CDC has put out to help each state and school district think through a safe reopening.
Last week, we put out guidance around testing for K-through-12 schools.  This guidance, like our guidance for colleges and universities, offers recommendations for how and when students, teachers, and staff should be tested.
While CDC does not make a recommendation in favor of universal testing, it’s a perfectly appropriate surveillance technique where the capacity exists, and capacity is growing all the time.  We’ve talked with colleges and universities that are able to use their research lab capacity with pooling of multiple samples to test their whole student bodies and staff frequently, thanks to regulatory flexibility that CMS and the FDA have provided.
Many of the leaders we heard from yesterday at the White House School Reopening Summit are doing testing before returning to school, and then sentinel surveillance.
On top of that, the measures we recommend universally — like keeping a distance, wearing a face covering, and frequent hand washing — are effective and can be applied in the college or the K-through-12 setting.
We put out the CDC guidance to enable and support states and school districts in reopening safely.  We want them to use the tools available to reduce risk, and we’ll be putting out more guidance on how schools can use each of these tools, such as face coverings.
On top of that, I will reiterate that our set of tools is expanding all of the time.  Just yesterday, we signed a new agreement with Regeneron to provide nearly half a billion dollars in support for a promising therapeutic, all the way to manufacturing hundreds of thousands of doses for the American people.  The initial doses, pending approval, would be available as soon as the end of this summer or early fall.  That is the first of a number of therapeutic agreements that we will do under the President’s Operation Warp Speed initiative.
Promising therapeutics are already being administered every day by our heroic healthcare workers.  I want to thank these heroes who continue to put themselves at risk, caring for those suffering from the virus.  We know many frontline workers have gotten sick, and we know some have given their lives, including some of my employees in the Indian Health Service, and America is deeply grateful.
It is because we are making progress against the virus and learning more about it every day that we can talk about how to bring America’s kids and teachers back to school safely.  We have the tools to do it, and it has to be a top priority.
So thank you to President Trump and the Vice President for putting such a focus on this very important aspect of our road to recovery.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.

1:29 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  All right.  Hello, everyone.  Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future.  The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities.  President Trump said, “After all, what do we want?  We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order.”  He went on to say, “We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities.  And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world.”  He went on to say, “We should all want the same thing.  How can it be any different than those things?”
This message is now more important and more timely than ever.  Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials — everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi.  Misguided movements, such as “Defund the Police,” seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever.  Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country.  An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families.  Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, “Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential.  Never forget: We are one family and one nation…We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so…they can build its future.”
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it’s an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

University of South Florida
Tampa, Florida
3:38 P.M. EDT
GOVERNOR DESANTIS:  Well, I want to thank the Vice President.  I want to thank Secretary Azar, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Birx for coming down to Florida, and also just for all the help that they provided throughout these many months.
You know, we are now in a situation where we are testing a lot more.  We also have a greater percentage of people testing positive.  I mean, throughout May and early June here in Hillsborough County, for example, I think they were testing at about 3 or 4 percent would test positive.  Now, we’re looking at places like Hillsborough and in Orange County, no longer 3, 4 percent but now 15 percent of folks are testing positive.  Obviously when you’re testing about 60,000 people a day — we’re getting results like that over the last week — that’s going to generate a lot of additional cases.
So we were discussing some of the things that we may be able to do going forward, including pooling, types of testing in conjunction with our universities — which I think will be really, really good.  We also spoke with some of the hospital systems here — Tampa General, BayCare — about other ways that we could be helpful.
You know, one of the things — if you go back to March when we, kind of, faced the initial wave of this, I mean, we had very few tests relative to what we have now.  Now hospitals test — anyone that comes in for something, they can test.  You know, we, between the state, we’re doing 10 to 15 thousand tests a day at all the different sites.
There was a question about PPE.  We’ve got PPE; hospitals have it, the state has it.  You know, we’re good to go there.  There was no treatment of any kind, really, for this.  It was totally novel.  The physicians have learned a lot.
And then, through Secretary Azar and HHS — I remember coming down, I think at the end of April, to visit Tampa General.  They asked about remdesivir.  We called Secretary Azar; they’ve been sending a bunch of the remdesivir down.  So the physicians are using that.  They’re using convalescent plasma.  And they are having definitely better results.
And then we also — even though we took a lot of action early to protect the long-term care facilities — since March, we have increasingly brought on COVID-only dedicated nursing facilities.  And so we now have 12 of these facilities throughout the state of Florida.  We have one in Pinellas, one in Polk, which the Tampa Bay hospitals can use and nursing homes can use.
And basically, the idea is: If you have somebody test positive in a nursing home, you don’t want that to spread to the other residents.  That individual is medically stable; they can be transferred to the COVID-only facility.  If they need hospitalization, obviously they go to the hospital.  But if they end up becoming stable while in the hospital, rather than be discharged back to that facility, which would create problems, you have a place to go to be able to discharge that.
So all around the state now we’ve got 750 beds in COVID-only nursing facilities.  And so we just brought one on in Miami.  We now have one in Broward, two in Palm Beach, two in southwest Florida, Brevard County, Jacksonville, Escambia, and Tallahassee.
So, pretty much anywhere around the state, if you have somebody who is a resident of a long-term care facility, that’s in the hospital, that’s medically stable but still contagious, you have a place where they can be safely transferred.  So we think that that’s something that’s very, very significant.
The message that we’ve really been sending for folks in Florida: I think because we had such a quiet May — because, you know, the positivity was so low, the caseload was so low — it kind of fell out of the news at the end of May, beginning of June, and I think people weren’t as focused on it anymore.  And now, obviously we’ve seen these cases.  So I think people are more focused on it.
But basically, the message is, you know, for those folks who are 65 and older, people that have significant underlying medical conditions, you know, do your best to avoid crowds and minimize close contact with people outside your home right now.
We have the virus community transmission, particularly with younger people.  If you look at where — you go back a month, the median age of our cases was in the 50s.  Now the median age of the cases here in Hillsborough County for the entire pandemic has dropped to 34.  And there’ll be days where we’ll get cases in Hillsborough County and the median age will be under 30.  In Orange County, the median age for the whole pandemic is now 32.  There’s days where it’ll be 28 and 29.  So it’s been a huge shift.
The case growth has really been in that 18 to 34, 35 age group.  Now, those are folks that are, by and large, going to be much less prone to significant consequences.  Nevertheless, with the increasing positivity rate, it’s clear that you’re seeing more and more community transmission really being driven by that age group.
And so if you’re someone in one of the medically vulnerable conditions or you’re an older person, you know, just understand that that’s out there, continue to be vigilant.  I think folks in Florida — the seniors — have been very, very vigilant throughout this whole time.  We still want to ask people to be able to do that going forward.
And then for, kind of, the general public, you know, we’re telling people to avoid the three Cs: you know, closed spaces.  In Florida, it’s hot.  People don’t want to be outside in 95-degree heat.  Just understand, if you’re getting together in closed spaces with poor ventilation, that is going to be a much better vector for this virus to be able to spread.
We’re also saying avoid large crowds.  Now, we had for a long time a 10-person gathering limit.  We’ve advised, you know, not to do more than 50.  But I would say the smaller the group, the better for that.
And then also, the close contact.  If you’re in really close, sustained contact with somebody, you’re going to be more apt to see transmission of this virus.
So avoid the three Cs.  Stay safe and take care of yourself during this holiday weekend.
I want to bring up the Vice President just to thank him.  He came down, I remember, at the very beginning of this in March.  We went down and met with the cruise line folks.  He’s always been there to help us as we’ve needed different things, and, you know, we have needed things from time to time.  And so I really want to thank him for being a friend to the state of Florida, being a friend to the people of Florida, and really never leaving this fight.
I mean, even as we saw numbers go down across the country in May, you know, now we see a Sun Belt resurgence, and he’s been, I think, all over the Sun Belt just in the last few days.  So we’ve already discussed ways that they can help Florida going forward, and I know that they’re going to be able to deliver on that.
So I want to — it’s my, really, honor to be able to welcome yet again to the state of Florida, our Vice President Mike Pence.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Governor DeSantis.  Thank you for your leadership.  The people of Florida deserve to know that from the very beginning of this pandemic, Governor DeSantis and his healthcare team have formed a seamless partnership with our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force.
And whether it be in testing, whether it be in personal protective equipment, whether it be in the distribution of therapeutics like remdesivir, or whether it be in advancing the kind of mitigation efforts that have kept Florida low for a long time until just a few short weeks ago — Governor, I want to thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and your partnership.
And I want to thank all the people of Florida for all of your efforts over the many months, and to say to each and every one of you, what we said to the Governor today is: We’re with you.  And at President Trump’s direction, we’re going to make sure that your governor and the state of Florida have what you need, when you need it, to meet this moment of rising cases across the state.
We really are here to assure the people of Florida that, as we — as we see the rising cases not only in this state but across the Sun Belt, that we’re going to do whatever it takes to make sure that our extraordinary healthcare workers have the resources and the support and supplies.
The Governor and I talked today about personnel, and we’ll be considering a request from the state of Florida about medical personnel that we’ll be processing in very short order.
But, Governor, I also want to thank you for your efforts.  I want to thank you for your efforts to open up Florida again.  We had good news this morning as a nation: Nearly 5 million jobs created in the month of June, including many here in the state of Florida.  It was the largest one-month increase in history.  And Florida, being an economic engine for the United States, played a key role in that.
But I also want to say, Governor, that we fully support your prudent steps in working to slow the spread and the rise in cases that are impacting Florida today.
As we said at a task force meeting not long ago, it’s — and I’d say to the people of Florida: It’s not an either/or choice.  If all of us will put into practice the guidance from state and local officials — which is wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask when it’s indicated by local officials, or wear a mask when you can social distance — we know that we can do what Florida did for those many months and what other impacted areas around the country did.  We can slow the spread.  We can flatten the curve.  But it’ll take all of us to do it.  And I just want to reassure you, Governor, that we’re going to be working with you to make sure that Florida has all the resources.
The economic comeback that’s underway is a — is a demonstration that we don’t have to choose between opening up America and the health of our people.  We can do both.  And that’s the challenge that we face today across the Sun Belt.
And we just want to encourage, with great respect, all Floridians to put these principles into practice and know that we’re going to stay with you every step of the way.
I do want to say that we’re encouraged today to hear a report from the Governor that, particularly in the category of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, that Florida’s hospitals are in good shape.  We also are pleased to hear the hospital capacity remains strong in this state.
We’re informed there’s about more than 13,000 total hospital beds available at this time.  Availability, 22 percent of hospital capacity.  Ventilators, which were an issue before our nation four months ago, at the beginning of this pandemic, are in abundant supply.  We’re told that there’s more than 5,500 ventilators available across the state of Florida.
And at President Trump’s direction, we worked with companies across the country.  We’re well on our way to manufacturing 100,000 ventilators in 100 days, and in just a matter of the next two weeks, we’ll have 50,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile.  And should the need arise anywhere here in Florida, we want to assure you, Governor, and all your healthcare workers that the resources will be there.
We’re also encouraged to hear that personal protective equipment remains in abundant supply in the state.  The federal government has shipped literally millions of N95 masks, surgical masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves, but we’ll continue to make sure that those resources flow to the great healthcare systems that we had the opportunity to meet with today.
As you’ll hear in a moment, too, from the director of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, we’re also making steady progress in distributing therapeutics, or medicines, to treat people that are suffering the symptoms of the coronavirus.  And I’m pleased to report to your governor today that, just yesterday, the latest shipment of remdesivir arrived in Florida — 34,000 vials of remdesivir that’s — that will literally treat thousands of patients in this state.
That, combined with other innovative treatments like steroids and convalescent plasma, we literally are — we’re in a much better place than even two months ago to be able to treat people who have contracted the coronavirus.
And I hope that — I hope that that message, more than anything else, comes through today to the people of Florida — is to understand that we are, because of all we’ve done as a country, because of President Trump’s leadership in standing up a whole-of-America approach — manufacturing supplies, innovating in testing, developing therapeutics, and well on our way to developing a vaccine — we hope and trust, perhaps even by the end of this year, that we are in a much better place to confront the rising cases that are impacting here in Florida and all across the country.
And so I want people to be vigilant, but we want people to be encouraged that we’re going to make sure your governor and the state of Florida has everything you need to meet this moment and do what Florida has been doing from the very beginning, and that is putting the health of the people of this state first.
And let me also say, with great admiration to the people of Florida, that the record of Florida in protecting the most vulnerable is among the best in the nation.  And, Governor, your steps — your steps to protect residents of long-term care, to create those COVID-only facilities, to do the kind of testing that’s — the record in Florida really speaks for itself.  And we commend you for that, and we’ll continue to support your efforts.
Governor, President Trump and I are absolutely committed to supporting your efforts to respond to this outbreak in Florida, to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable, to get our kids back to school, and to keep opening up our economy.
But lastly, let me say to all my fellow Americans all across Florida: We all need to do our part, and we once again want to specifically encourage younger Americans in Florida.  It’s one of the unique things — I was in Arizona yesterday, I was in Texas over the weekend, and as we discussed with your governor, it’s a truism of this moment in the pandemic that some 50 percent of all the new cases are Americans under the age of 35.
And to each and every one of you, let me just say from my heart: I know you know that without a serious underlying health condition, that the threat of the coronavirus to younger Americans is very, very low.  But no younger American would ever want to put at risk a grandmother, a grandfather, a mom, a dad, an elderly neighbor, or a friend by inadvertently exposing them to the coronavirus.
And that’s why we encourage you to be vigilant, to heed state and local guidance, and to respect those who are most vulnerable, in particular.  And just know that if all of us do our part, we’ll get through this.
I can’t help but feel that the resilience and the strength and the character of the American people shown forth today, that even in these challenging times, we’re continuing to see America’s economy coming back and America going back to work.
And I’m just absolutely confident, if all of us do all that we need to do, we’ll do what we’ve done before in other parts of the country and what Florida did for so many months: We will slow the spread, we will flatten the curve, we will save lives, and we will bring Florida and America’s economy back bigger and better than ever before.
With that, I’m going to invite to the podium a couple of members of our team.  Dr. Deborah Birx has been the White House coordinator, been our lead scientist on all matters.  And after her, we’ll hear from the Secretary of HHS briefly, and the head of the FDA, to share with you what we heard today and what we’re seeing.
But, Governor, once again, thank you for your leadership.  And to all the people of Florida: We’re with you, and we’re going to stay with you until that day comes that we put the coronavirus in the past here in Florida and all across America.
Thank you and God bless you.
Deb?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  It’s a pleasure to be here with all of you today.  And I want to start where the Vice President left off: that we all have a critical role to play in the next few weeks.
We were watching this area, Tampa, very closely — through March, through April, through May, through your reopening.  And for days after days, weeks after weeks, we saw you sitting at 4 percent, which everybody, including the World Health Organization, said is a safe place to be.
At end of May, we began to see your numbers increase and go from a very low of 4 percent at the end of May to this high now of 17 percent.  So this virus came to Tampa and spread through Tampa sometime along the end of May, and then spread through the asymptomatic groups that don’t, as described, get symptoms and constantly spread, and to the point where you have this number of cases today.  And we all have a critical role to play over the next two to three weeks to stop that spread.
To every Floridian: We know what works, in addition to the hand washing and the social distancing, wearing masks, and not having large gatherings inside, not having large gathering outside.  But if you participated in a large gathering in the last four weeks, we ask all of you to come forward and be tested because of the level of asymptomatic spread.
So we’re asking for everyone under 40 that, if you were in a gathering, please go and get tested.  Please wear a mask.  Please do all of the hygiene issues.  And please stay away from those who have comorbidities.
Of course, the governors and mayors are all acting together to really extend and stay safe for everybody in Florida.  But also, the federal government has a role, and that’s why it was exciting to be here today to talk to the University of South Florida and your brilliant scientists and physicians here to really start to implement pooled testing.  That is our breakthrough that we’ve been working on for three weeks.
We think that Florida and this university and this particular county is a great place to start.  How can that be utilized?  It can be utilized three ways.  One way is going into neighborhoods and testing whole families into a single tube.  And then if anybody is positive, you would go back, use your contact tracing to test everyone in the household.
It is easy for them to test themselves by just the front of their nose into the transport media, coming back here, working with your research community to run those tests, going back then and testing the positive households and ensuring those that are positive remain quarantined and isolated for the next couple of weeks.
It’s the role for the federal government to support that enhanced testing.  FDA has put out new guidelines to encourage it.  We have put guidelines up on the White House website.  They’ve been there for three or four weeks, but we really need to act on them and have a partnership, like here today, bringing together community with scientists and the medical field to really take that next step.
That can also be used in screening large numbers of school students, because you can put 10 into one tube.  So you can do a classroom with retest.
This is groundbreaking for putting people back to school and keeping universities open, where you could test an entire dorm probably with 10 to 15 tests, always with the ability to go back and do individual diagnostic tests for the pools that are positive.
We think that this is a critical breakthrough.  As the FDA continues to bring new testing online, this would allow us to go from 5,000 tests a day to 50,000 tests a day.  And for in Florida, that would be a log increase that we could support and continue, and we want to encourage that but we want to work alongside you.
And as the Vice President said, of course we are here to support your medical community — and you’ll hear from Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar — but we’re here also as the federal government so that you know that you have our continuous support.
There are things that we have to do together as individuals that established this great nation.  It’s a privilege to wear red, white, and blue today.  I don’t often get — you only get to do that a couple of times a year, so it’s a privilege to be here celebrating the birth of our country and asking each American citizen, particularly Floridians, to do the responsible thing of wearing a mask, protecting others.
And we, as a state and local, and federal government, will walk beside you and help with all of those innovations to bring us to a different place — lower those cases and stop the spread.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, Governor DeSantis, thank you for having us here and for welcoming us again to Florida and for being here in Tampa.  Boy, I learned a lot.  I learned a lot from the University of South Florida and Tampa General.  Got a long list of actions coming out of this really tremendous session that we get so much value from.
And thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of our all-of-America approach to defeating this virus.
I want to begin by thanking the healthcare workers and also the members of the HHS team that are working here in Florida and across the country to beat this virus.  They put themselves in harm’s way every day to help their fellow citizens, and we owe them all a deep debt of gratitude.
Thanks to the President and the Vice President’s leadership over the past several months, we at HHS and across the administration have built a six-point, all-of-America strategy to protect our country from the virus and, in time, defeat it.  And in each of these domains, as the Vice President said, we have advanced dramatically over just the last two months.  That’s surveillance, testing, containment, healthcare system resilience, therapeutics, and vaccines.
Here in Florida, thanks to the strong work by the state, we now have far more ability to track the spread of the virus than ever before.  We know that cases are rising quickly in parts of the state, but with the right data, as Dr. Birx said, we can target our approach and respond.
To support testing and containment, this week, CDC put out guidance around testing for higher education, as well as for K-through-12 students.
On therapeutics, we’ve distributed nearly 7,000 remdesivir treatment courses to Florida.  And this week, the President secured access to another 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir over the next three months, which will be allocated based on data that we continue to collect about the virus.
We’ve put out treatment guidelines for the use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids.  And we’re seeing promising data on the use of convalescent plasma, in terms — in the treatment of tens of thousands of patients.  These are three therapeutics that likely have already saved thousands of lives.
On vaccines: This week, the FDA put out guidance to accelerate progress toward a safe and effective vaccine.  Before a vaccine is ready, we’ll be working with states like Florida to plan for what distribution will look like.
Now, individuals will have a key role to play in our strategy.  You can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community by assessing the risks that you face.  Just think about three questions: First, who am I and whom do I live with?  Do age or underlying conditions put me at a higher risk?  Second, where am I?  Is the virus spreading where I live, and what are the recommendations of state and local authorities where I am?  And third, what am I thinking about doing?  Going to a crowded indoor place is riskier than an outdoor activity.
Practice physical distancing.  When you can’t keep a distance, wear a cloth face covering.  Always practice good hygiene, including hand washing.  These simple steps will make it much easier for us as a country to defeat the virus together.
So thank you all very much for being here, but thank you for everything that the people of Florida are doing not just to protect yourself and those you live with, but if you’re young, as was said earlier by the Vice President, you know the risk to you are quite low.  But you’re protecting vulnerable people in your household.  You’re also protecting the stranger standing next to you in the grocery store line, and you don’t know if that person is vulnerable, and you don’t want that on your conscience.
Practice social distancing, wear face covering, and practice good personal hygiene.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Stephen?
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the coronavirus task force.  It’s really been remarkable.  And, Governor, just, again, a remarkable effort, particularly protecting seniors in your state.
So I came to the job as FDA Commissioner after being a cancer doctor for over 30 years.  And I know the power of hope, but I also know that false hope can be damaging.  And what I saw today, the partnership of Tampa General and University of South Florida, gives me great hope.
What I saw was a partnership that developed a care plan that really accelerated and advanced the care of the patients with COVID-19 — something that we’re seeing across the country.  That is something that gives me great hope for Americans who might be afflicted with COVID-19.
President Trump asked the FDA to reduce regulatory barriers to getting medical products out to Americans during this time of a public health emergency.  And we set up something called the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.  And what we’ve seen over the last several months is just the incredible American biomedical research engine go forth.  We now have a number of therapies that are available for patients, and that also gives me great hope.
We have remdesivir, that’s been mentioned, which has been shown to reduce the stay of hospitalization in sick COVID-19 patients.
We’ve seen a trial that’s shown us that corticosteroids, dexamethasone, and others have the potential for reducing mortality by 30 percent in sick hospitalized patients.  And that has been mentioned here.  We have convalescent plasma, and convalescent plasma, of course, has been used for years for patients who’ve had infectious diseases, where you take the liquid protein portion of a blood that has the immunity, the natural immunity from someone who’s recovered from COVID-19, and you give that to someone who’s sick.
We’ve seen some early encouraging results in 20,000 patients that’s been shown to be safe.  And we have more than 28,000 patients in the U.S. who’ve been treated with convalescent plasma.  And we’ll get some relatively — we’ll get some news relatively soon on the data on the effectiveness of this.
But one thing I want to tell Americans: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, you should contact your local blood bank, the American Red Cross, because this could be lifesaving for someone with COVID-19, and it would be great for you to go and to donate and provide that opportunity to someone who’s afflicted with the disease.
Just a moment to tell you about other things: There are 141 clinical trials that are currently ongoing and overseen by the FDA.  There are more than 300 applications for therapeutics at the FDA right now.  So, again, this great American biomedical research engine continues; the pipeline is robust.
A little bit about vaccines: I want to congratulate Secretary Azar and his incredible leadership of the Operation Warp Speed.  In addition to Operation Warp Speed, there are a number of other vaccine manufacturers around the world that have vaccines that are in development.  We’ve authorized to proceed in clinical trial four vaccines, another six manufacturers are with us with applications, and another a dozen or more are actually talking to us about vaccines.
So in, record time, from identification of this virus, which we have to remember occurred in January, we have a vaccine that now is in the middle stages of clinical trials, and we expect two of have them to be in the later stages of trials — phase three trials in July.
As was mentioned, we did issue guidance with respect to vaccine development.  And one thing I want to assure the American people is that your FDA is on the job.  We will not cut corners in our assessment to the vaccine.  Our solemn promise to the American people is that we will look at the data associated with the vaccine, and we will make a decision about the safety and effectiveness of that vaccine using our typical high standards.
And so we all want, urgently, a vaccine.  I think we’re making really good progress.  I am cautiously optimistic, but FDA will be on the job, with respect to assessing its safety and efficacy.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Questions for me, any member of our team, or the Governor?  I think we’ve got a little bit of time.  Anyone?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-governor-desantis-florida-members-coronavirus-task-force-tampa-fl/

4:43 P.M. EDT
     MS. MCENANY:  So I am pleased to inform everyone that Seattle has been liberated.  The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, otherwise known as “CHAZ” — I think they switched their name to “CHOP,” but I’m told they went back to “CHAZ” — was a failed four-week Democrat experiment by the radical left.  And the results are in: Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured. 
     While the Democrat mayor of Seattle proclaimed that CHAZ was to be, quote, “the summer of love,” in fact, it was not.  And other failed Democrat politicians also remained passive, or even silent, in the face of anarchy.  But while that happened, President Trump set the tone: Law and order must prevail to preserve peace in our streets. 
     The President is not the Democrat governor of the state of Washington.  The President is not the Democrat mayor of Seattle.  But, nevertheless, the President must lead by example and be prepared to act in the face of failed Democrat leadership, which is what we saw in Democrat Seattle and Democrat Wisconsin.
     President Trump has always stood on the side of law and order, and we are pleased to report that law and order has prevailed, and Seattle has been liberated from the anarchists.
     In President Trump’s America, autonomous zones will have no sanctuary.  The BHAZ, B-H-A-Z — which stood for the Black House Autonomous Zone, across from the White House — was swiftly dismantled.  One hundred anarchists were arrested for rioting and destruction of federal property here in D.C; I believe that number is now above 300.  Four men have been charged in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  And there are 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. 
     You contrast the President’s vision of law and order to that of the failed CHAZ experiments and anarchy, and here’s what you find in the failed Democratic experiment that took place out in Seattle: The Seattle Times said the shooting at Seattle’s CHOP protest tragically killed a 16-year-old boy, leaving a 14-year-old “seriously injured.”  That’s what happens in an autonomous zone. 
     The police chief, Carmen Best, who did a marvelous job winding down the CHOP zone noted that CHOP has become “lawless and brutal” and “enough is enough,” and she took action.  According to reports, quote, “Police also investigated several vehicles circling the CHOP zone” with “people inside carrying firearms and wearing body armor.”  This was no, quote, “summer of love,” as the Democrat mayor in Seattle said.
     And President Trump compelled action.  He has said, “Take back your city NOW.  If you don’t do it, I will.”  He has said, “This is not a game.  These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY.  MOVE FAST!” 
     And finally, the Democrat mayor in Seattle, who was long delayed, finally gave the order to dismantle the CHAZ.  And it was an admission — it was an admission that President Trump’s vision is right, that anarchy is wrong, and that law and order bring peace.
     And with that, I’ll take questions. 
     Kristen.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-070120/

720,Trump,2020-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Governor Ducey of Arizona on COVID-19 | Phoenix, AZ",Nan,"Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
Phoenix, Arizona
12:57 P.M. MST
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon.  We just completed a thorough briefing with Governor Ducey and his healthcare team here in Arizona about this state’s response to the rising number of coronavirus cases, and I’m going to share a few reflections on what we’ve heard and that’s what we’re determined to do. 
But before that, let me take a moment to reflect on another aspect of this day — a huge win for the people of Arizona, for American workers, farmers, and ranchers — and that is that, as of today, the USMCA has taken effect.  It is, I am told, it — this state in particular sees trade with Mexico and Canada support 228,000 jobs, $20 billion annually.
And I want to take this opportunity particularly to thank Governor Doug Ducey for his efforts in moving the USMCA through the Congress.  As a candidate, President Trump committed to renegotiate NAFTA in a way that put American jobs, American workers, farmers, and ranchers first, and we’ve done that.  And that promise was kept when the USMCA took effect today.  So, Governor Ducey, you have our sincerest thanks.
President Trump asked us to be here today, with the dramatic rise of coronavirus cases in Arizona, to receive a briefing from Governor Ducey and the healthcare team about this state’s response to this pandemic. 
And I want to say, first and foremost, to Governor Ducey that, from the very first days of this pandemic, your leadership and your entire team in Arizona has really formed a seamless partnership with our administration, with the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  And up until roughly three weeks ago, Arizona had literally set the pace in slowing the spread, in flattening the curve.  And we’re grateful to you, to your team, and to all the people of Arizona for all of their efforts over the past four months.
But with cases rising dramatically — and not just here in Maricopa County, but all across Arizona — we wanted to be here to get a report from the ground.  We’ll take back what we heard here today.  We’ll ensure with the team that we brought with us, including the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security who oversees FEMA, to make sure that Arizona has what you need, when you need it.
We told the governor today and we say to the people of Arizona: We’re with you, and we’re going to make sure that Arizona has whatever it takes to meet this moment, to slow the spread, to flat- — flatten the curve, to save lives.  That’s our commitment to each and every one of you.
We also brought along Admiral John Polowczyk, who has coordinated all of the PPE supplies, the construction of ventilators.  And while we are encouraged to hear today that’s the — the hospital capacity here remains strong on supplies and equipment, we did hear in the briefing today for the need for personnel.
We’ve already responded.  Sixty-two medical personnel arrived this week in Tucson.  But the governor conveyed to us an additional request for another 500 personnel, and I’ve instructed the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security to move out immediately on providing the additional doctors and nurses and technical personnel.
We want to say to all the incredible healthcare workers here in Arizona: Help is on the way.  And we’re going to spare no expense to provide the kind of reinforcements that you will need all across this state should this — this coronavirus pandemic continue to expand in Arizona.
As I said, we were encouraged to hear that hospital capacity remains manageable: 88 — 85 percent of medical beds and only 88 percent of ICU beds.  But the governor and I also spoke today about two additional facilities that were already reviewed and developed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the governor knows that we’re prepared to stand those surge facilities up in very short order if the need should arrive.
We’re going to make sure that that Arizona continues to have the healthcare capacity in this state to render to everyone who contracts the coronavirus the level of healthcare that we would want any one of our family members to receive.
And finally, let me say: The President and I couldn’t be more grateful for Governor Ducey’s leadership throughout this coronavirus pandemic.  But with cases rising in the last several weeks, we want to make it clear that we fully support the steps that Governor Doug Ducey and local health officials are implementing here across the state of Arizona to slow the spread.
Arizona flattened the curve early on in this pandemic, but we all noted something changed about the middle of May.  And that’s why this governor has stepped forward, took decisive action to put the health of the people of Arizona first.  And President Trump and I fully support the responsible steps that he’s taken to limit large gatherings; to pau- — pause operations of bars and gyms, movie theaters, and waterparks; and delay the start of school until August 17th. 
President Trump and I and our entire task force are absolutely committed, Governor, to supporting your efforts to respond to this outbreak, to slow the spread, to protect the most vulnerable so that we can keep our economy moving forward and get our kids back to school. 
The CDC just today posted new guidance for getting our kids back to school; yesterday posted new guidance for opening up colleges and universities.  The governor and I discussed today the paramount importance of us moving forward in a way where we can get our kids back into the classroom come this fall. 
It’s been — it’s been tremendous leadership here in Arizona since the first days of this pandemic.  Your healthcare workers have done a remarkable job, particularly in recent weeks and at this very hour, caring for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus.  But I want to say to all the good people of Arizona: We all need to do our part.  And we want to encourage every Arizonan to adhere to the guidance that the governor has issued and also the guidance of local authorities. 
We issue a particular plea to young people.  I was informed today by the Maricopa County Department of Health that more than 50 percent of all of those who are testing positive in Maricopa County are under the age of 35.  And young people know that, without an underlying health condition, that the threat to them of a serious outcome for the coronavirus remains low.  But we want to remind our young people: As you see the measures that the governor has put into place and you hear about the call for commonsense personal hygiene and the wearing of masks that this is about protecting our most vulnerable.
I’ve got three 20-somethings in my family, and I know that no young person here in Arizona would want to inadvertently expose a grandmother, or a grandfather, an elderly neighbor, a mom, or a dad to the coronavirus. 
And so to each of them, we want to commend all the steps the governor has put into place.  But we want to remind you that now is the time for all of us, particularly the young among us, to remember to wash your hands, practice good hygiene, wear a mask when indicated by state or local authorities or when social distancing is not possible.  We can all do our part to slow the spread, to flatten the curve, to save lives. 
And remember, it’s not an either/or.  Dr. Fauci said, not just a few short days ago, that we shouldn’t look at these public safety measures as an impediment to continuing to open up our economy; we should look at them as a vehicle to opening up.  The more we all do to support the public health measures that have put into effect, the quicker we can get Arizona’s economy growing, get our kids back to school, and that’s we’re determined to do. 
We’re all in this together.  And together, I’m very confident that, as all of us do our part each and every day, we’ll slow the spread, we’ll flatten the curve, we’ll save lives all across this state, and we will lay a foundation to bring this state’s economy back bigger and better than ever before.
So thank you very much.  And, Governor Ducey, thank you for an important and informative briefing.  We’re with you.
GOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President. 
I want to say thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership and your partnership throughout this pandemic.  It was great to see you today in person, but I’m able to see you at least once or twice a week on the constant communication that we have from the Coronavirus Task Force.  We very much appreciate it — your commitment and President’s — Trump’s commitment to serving Arizona and helping us solve the issues that are in front of us today.
I also want to thank the Coronavirus Task Force — to have Secretary Chad Wolf here today; Rear Admiral Polowczyk, who is talking to us about supplies; and Dr. Deborah Birx, who has been with us for several days in Arizona, meeting with leaders, decision makers, and influencers in the healthcare industry across our state, and actually seeing what’s happening across the Southwest, including New Mexico and Texas.  We’re grateful for what she has been able to contribute to the discussion, the questions she was able to answer, and guidance that she was able to clarify. 
I also want to thank General McGuire and Dr. Cara Christ, who are working with their counterparts in the federal government, and the hard work that they have been doing. 
And most of all, I want to say thankful — thank you to our healthcare workers who are on the front lines — our doctors, our nurses, our hospital staff, and all of our caregivers.  The decisions that we are making are to help you help the people in Arizona that need it. 
So our message is clear, in terms of where Arizona is today: You are safer at home.  We want to slow the spread of this virus and protect the most vulnerable.  We have taken the steps to temporarily close bars and gyms and waterparks, tubing, and movie theaters. 
We focused for a long time, and have done a very good job, on our most vulnerable — those that are 65 years or older and at high risk or with chronic health issues.  We now need the message to spread far and wide that we all can contribute to slowing the spread of this virus and have Arizona a safer place by following the fundamentals of masking up, washing your hands, maintaining that physical distance between others, and when you’re sick, staying home.
If we commit to that, and we do it with increased intensity over the next several weeks, we’re going to be in a different and better position in Arizona. 
So with that, again, I want to thank our federal partners, Vice President Pence and President Trump.  Whatever we have asked for and needed — whether it was increased testing or further support on contact tracing, personal protective equipment from face guards to gowns — the answer has been yes, and with urgency, in addition to helping clarify some federal guidance that will help our hospitals here on the ground with support and resources.
So I couldn’t be more grateful for your partnership and leadership in this battle.  It’s something we need to remain vigilant on, and also have flexibility to work with our local leaders across the state who have done an incredible job communicating the benefits of putting on a mask and how that can help our fellow citizens slow the virus and protect the most vulnerable. 
And with that, I want to turn the podium over to Secretary Wolf of Homeland Security, who has been an incredible partner as well on everything that Arizona has needed — not only with the focus from FEMA, but whatever issues we’ve had at the border, as well.  For that, we’re grateful.
Secretary Wolf.
SECRETARY WOLF:  Let me first start off by again thanking the Vice President for his leadership of the Coronavirus Task Force and the team that he’s really put together, several of which are here today.  It’s really been outstanding.
Let me also thank Governor Ducey, again, for your leadership throughout the pandemic, but particularly over the last several weeks as you’ve seen cases increase here, and again, for the team that you’ve pulled together as well.
DHS continues to proudly support Arizona and all the states that are continuing to respond to the pandemic.  We have done so.  We have obligated more than 90 million to the state of Arizona for National Guard operations, for alternative care facilities, other emergency protective measures, and we’ll continue to do that.
Let me also say that, again, through Admiral Polowczyk’s great efforts, we’ve been able to send over 318 million units of PPE to the state of Arizona as well, and we’ll continue to surge as we need to do that as well.
The Governor mentioned the border.  We continue to look at any threats that are coming across the border, and we put in some essential restrictions several months ago to make sure that we slowed the spread while keeping essential traffic and that trade occurring across your southern border — our southern border — Arizona’s southern border. 
It’s absolutely critical to the economies along that border into the U.S. economy, and we want to make sure that we get that right.  We’re continuing to assess that on a day-by-day, week-by-week basis to see if there’s any changes that we need to make.  And we’ll certainly talk about that at the task force.
But let me just end by again thanking the governor for his efforts throughout the pandemic.  And I will say, as we deal with the pandemic, we’re also dealing with other incidents that are going on throughout the country. 
So the governor’s strong support for law and order is vitally important in these days as the department is the country’s largest law enforcement agency.  And so we stand ready to support our state and local partners as we’re protecting federal facilities, we’re protecting monuments and statues, and the like.
So I want to again thank the governor for his outstanding work as well.
DR. BIRX:  Mr. Vice President, Governor Ducey, it’s been a privilege to be with the people of Arizona for the last two or three days.  What has been remarkable to me is watching the people of Arizona respond to the “Mask Up” Arizona guidelines that made it clear that we respect one another by wearing masks.  I saw that wherever I went for the last several days in Maricopa County, and I want to thank the people of Arizona for showing that respect for each other.
We know this virus is circulating actively in several counties.  We also know that there are other counties at risk, and I want to call on all the county leadership and the individuals in each of these counties that, as soon as you see an increase in your test positivity rate, to put on a mask, protect one another.
Governor Ducey’s directive is to really increase our — not only our respect for one another, but that clear communication coming from his health team that made it clear that wearing a mask will change the spread of this virus.  And also making it clear that, with this moment in time, closing the bars, decreasing restaurant spaces, and the other actions will really dramatically having an impact.
To all of our Millennials and Gen Z, thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and showing how important the mask and social distancing are, and that communication that you’re having with your parents and your grandparents to protect them. 
But I also want to call on you to be aware that there are people in your age group — people in your age group, every day, that have preexisting conditions that you may not know about — that may have diabetes, that may have hypertension, that may have a weight issue.  These individuals, no matter what their age, are susceptible.  And you can see it in the hospitalizations here in Arizona.  So you’re not only protecting those we totally respect in the over-65 age group, but you’re protecting one another.  And I appreciate that. 
Yesterday, I got to meet with an entire group, and it showed the Governor’s commitment and the health commitment of Dr. Christ to understanding guidelines don’t work unless they’re translated and working alongside community members. 
So in that meeting — for community members from the Hispanic community, from the African American community, and today I got to meet with the tribal nation leaders — understanding that messages are not a standalone; that they have to translate into the very fabric of our communities so that people understand what their risks are, so that people can get tested, and so that people understand the importance of wearing a mask. 
I also saw incredible innovation of the American spirit.  We heard from your universities and we heard from your hospitals of the advances that you’re taking into the field and care for those who need us the most, and the innovations coming out of your universities to provide innovations and testing and really expanding testing. 
We talked about how to 10x testing through pooling and communities — communities that are in multi-generational households — bringing testing to the community and to those households, and using household pools to be able to test in 100 percent of the community. 
I want to thank the African American leader I met yesterday from the community who set up an African American task force to really make sure that messages from the Governor and the health team were being translated at the level of the people who needed to hear it. 
I thank you for bringing together and understanding that words that aren’t translated into actions will not stop this virus.  But I am encouraged and I am hopeful, and I am hoping we will see the dramatic impact of you all taking responsibility and wearing masks, so when it comes to August, we can open the schools and open the universities because we know we can stop the spread by utilizing masks and making these small adjustments into our lifestyle and show respect for one another. 
So thank you, Governor Ducey, for your leadership, for your looking at the science and the data and the evidence.  Thank you to your health team and the brilliant Dr. Christ.  It’s been a pleasure to spend time with you and your amazing county public health leaders who understand how to get into the community.  Thank you for your time and the respect that you gave me by wearing masks in public. 
Thank you.
GOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you, Deb.

Rockville, Maryland
4:32 P.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for joining us.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but it is a particular honor to be here at the headquarters of the United States Public Health Service to make an important announcement on the establishment of the Ready Reserve Corps.
And also, on behalf of the President and on behalf of entire team, to express our gratitude to the women and men who wear the blue uniforms across the country and have served our nation with such distinction and compassion over the past four months.
I’m — I’m here with several members of our team, who you will hear from in the course of this briefing.  But as we gather here today, more than 2.6 million coronavirus cases in the United States; sadly, we’ve lost more than 129,000 Americans.
The data report that we received today from Dr. Deborah Birx — who is, as we speak, in Arizona, briefing with Governor Ducey and their team — is that, at this moment, we have 12 states with rising cases and percent-positive cases — a combination of both rising cases and rising percent positive.  Beyond that, there are another 28 states that either have rising cases or rising positives but do not have a combination of those two things.
We also continue to see that roughly 50 percent of all the new cases are taking place in four states.  And so, as you would anticipate, we’re — we are working with governors and state health officials in all of the states that are impacted, but we’re particularly focusing on the four states that are generating the majority of the cases which, of course, are California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.
I’m pleased to say that, while there are 29 states that have — don’t have a combination of rising positivity and rising cases, we also have an additional 10 states that are either entirely stable or have numbers that are so low that they’re de minimis.  So our focus, particularly at the task force today, was on the 12 states that have the combination.
Beyond that, while one life lost is too many and we mourn the loss of every American and grieve with every family that lost a loved one, because of the dedication of our healthcare workers, because of our response and the response of the American people, we are grateful that, today, fatalities are at the lowest level since the end of March.
We continue to be vigilant as we see rising cases.  We understand that that could — that could change.  But again, to see the precipitous decline in fatalities is a tribute to the healthcare workers in this country and to the cooperation and the compassion of the American people.
Our message to every American in the states that are most affected by rising cases and rising positivity rates is: We are with you.  We are working with the governors in your state to ensure that they have the resources and the support to meet this moment and provide the level of healthcare that any one of us would expect for a member of our family.
But to all of the American people, I say, on behalf of the President of the United States and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that because of all that we’ve done over the last four months, we’re ready.  We’re in a much better place than we were four months ago or even two months ago.  And part of our briefing today will focus on the progress that we have made and our ability to respond to the outbreaks that we’re seeing occurring in states, particularly across the south.
I’ve been traveling across the country — I was actually in Texas over this past weekend; received a full briefing from Governor Abbott about their response — and I will be traveling to Arizona tomorrow, meeting with Governor Ducey.  And I’ll be able to confirm to him that we were informed today that a team deployed by FEMA of 62 Disaster Medical Assistance personnel are on the ground in Arizona.  We’re also currently processing a request from Texas, and we’re in consultation with other states.
As you will hear in a moment, with regard to testing, with regard to personal protective equipment, with regard to ventilators, with regard to therapeutic medicines, we are in a strong position all across the affected areas of the country to meet this moment.  But in consultation with the states, we’re — we’re going to make sure that they have the reinforcements in healthcare workers.  And I’m pleased to confirm today that 62 DMAT, or Disaster Medical Assistant Team, members have arrived in Arizona.
I’ll also be traveling later this week to the state of Florida, where Dr. Birx and I will also receive a briefing, along with Secretary Azar, about that state’s response.
At the present moment, all 50 states in the country are reopening and have done so in one degree or another since the beginning of May, when we issued our Guidelines to Open Up America Again.
At this moment in time, because of the rising cases, at least four states have taken action to close down bars, limit capacity in restaurants, and another 10 states have slowed down or postponed certain reopening efforts.
And let me make it very clear that we fully support the new guidance that’s been issued by the governors in these states.  We truly do believe that these prudent measures and additional guidance and steps will make it possible for us to continue to move our nation forward, to continue to reopen in a safe and responsible way, while putting the health — the health of our citizens first.
I thought Dr. Fauci put it well in a recent task force meeting when he said, and I think also testified today, that we “should not look at public safety measures as an impediment to opening up America, [that] rather, we should look at them as the vehicle to opening up,” as we see rising cases in particularly those 12 states where we have a combination of rising cases and positivity.
The American people deserve to know that our best health experts say it’s not an either/or.  It’s not whether we continue to open up or whether we move in an opposite direction, but rather it’s whether we take these prudent measures that will slow the spread and put the health of our citizens first.
Our governors in the affected areas and their public health officials are making — are taking strong action to keep their states open, while slowing the spread and putting the health of their citizens first.  And they have our full support.
Let me say again, as I said at the outset: The American people deserve to know that we’re in a much better place today, thanks to the whole-of-government approach, the whole-of-America approach that President Trump initiated at the very outset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The — working in cooperation with agencies across the federal government, working with the private sector across this country, we literally have scaled — now 33 million tests have been performed across the United States.
And as Admiral Brett Giroir will detail momentarily, we’re — we’re testing between 500 and 600 thousand Americans every single day, with the capacity to significantly increase that through the innovation of what is known as “pooling.”
And when it comes to medical supplies, FEMA has facilitated the delivery of literally billions of gloves and gowns and masks.  And as Admiral Polowczyk will detail in just a few moments, we are in continuous contact with not just states, but with hospitals in states across the country.  And we continue to receive very strong reports about the support they’ve received and the supplies that are available to meet this moment.
Also, we’re in a much better place because of the availability of what’s known as therapeutics or medicines to treat people that have contracted the coronavirus and are experiencing severe symptoms.
Now, Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA is here, and he will speak about the progress that we are making, whether it be the availability of remdesivir, which we’re distributing another tranche this week; the use of blood plasma, of steroid treatments; and — also, we continue to hear very hopeful signs about the continuing — continuing progress for developing a vaccine for the American people.
And so, with that, I’m going to — I’m going to yield to the team here to give you updates.  I’m going to begin with Secretary Azar, who will update us on our national response, including important work the CDC did today with regard to opening up our schools again.  And then Admiral Giroir will update us on testing, Admiral Polowczyk on supplies, and Dr. Hahn on medicines.  And then, finally, we’ll hear from Dr. Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General of the United States, who will give counsel to every American in the states that are impacted and all across the country about best practices.
So to every American in states that are seeing rising cases and rising trends in positivity: We want — we want to assure you we’re with you.  And we’re deploying, at the President’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to meet this moment and working in strong partnership with your state and local officials.
And to every American: We want to assure you that we’re ready, more ready than ever before, to meet this coronavirus pandemic because of the — because of the resources that our President, that agencies at the federal government, the steps deployed and efforts at state government, and mostly because of what the American people have done and demonstrated that they have the ability to do.
I mean, the truth is, while we’ve made great progress on making availability of testing and supplies and medicines, we all need to do our part.  We know how to slow the spread.  And the commonsense measures that we outlined in our phased approach to open up America again, the guidelines that apply to all of the phases are — ought to be embraced by every American: wash your hands, practice good hygiene, and wear a mask.  Wear a mask when — whenever your state and local authorities say it’s appropriate.  It’s always good idea to wear a mask when social distancing is not possible.
We’re all in this together, and we have every confidence that as we met the moment before when we saw this pandemic first strike in the northwest and then strike so hard around the Greater New York City area, then New Orleans, then Michigan, that with a with a — with a whole-of-government approach, a whole-of-America approach, cooperation of the American people, we’ll do what we did earlier on in this pandemic: We’ll slow the spread and we’ll save lives.
And with that, Secretary Azar and members of the team will brief, and then we’ll have time for questions.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President, for honoring HHS and the Commissioned Corps with your presence today.  And thank you for your leadership of the President’s all-of-America response to COVID-19.
I’d also like to thank Admiral Giroir and Vice Admiral Adams for their service during this crisis and for their dedication to strengthening the Commissioned Corps.
The men and women of the Commissioned Corps have been and will continue to be central to our COVID-19 response and on all six points of our strategy to defeat the virus: surveillance, testing, containment, healthcare capacity, vaccines, and therapeutics.
To every member of the Commissioned Corps who’s gone into harm’s way in this crisis, who’s spent time away from home and loved ones, we are deeply grateful.
I want to mention one particular step forward we took today to help Americans get back to work and back to school while protecting us from the virus: new guidance from the CDC as to how higher education institutions can protect students and their employees.  In particular, it offers recommendations for how and when testing should be used for students, faculty, and staff, including both testing for symptomatic individuals and testing for asymptomatic individuals who’ve had possible exposure to the virus.
The guidance also notes that in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, where resources allow, colleges and universities can work with local health officials to consider testing asymptomatic students and staff who have no known exposure.  This may make sense in order to identify outbreaks and inform control measures, and would especially apply to groups like those living in congregate housing.
This guidance relies on what we’ve learned about the virus in recent months.  In the very near future, we will also be releasing similar guidance around K-through-12 schools, recognizing how important safe schools are to reopening our country.
These are just two examples of the science-based resources that we’re providing for state and local health departments and other institutions as they work with federal assistance to continue the fight against the virus and to reopen our country.
We need to reopen America.  We have to get back to work, back to school, back to worship, back to healthcare.  But we must all play our individual parts to enable this reopening.  We can reverse these outbreaks and prevent future ones by doing what the President has called for since the beginning in his guidance: practice social distancing, wear facial coverings where social distancing is not possible, and practice good personal hygiene.
By doing so, you protect yourself, you protect vulnerable household members, but you also protect the person you may be standing next to in the grocery line.  And you don’t know whether they’re vulnerable.  You have no way of knowing whether they’re at high risk of severity, hospitalization, or fatality.  You protect them.
There’s just three simple steps to keep reopening: social distance; wear facial coverings when you can’t social distance; and practice good personal hygiene.  It’s all we need to do to keep reopening.  We can work, go to school, go to worship, reengage with healthcare, if we all, as individuals, practice good, responsible behavior to protect each other and to protect ourselves.
So thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well done.  Admiral?
ADMIRAL GIRIOR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mr. Secretary.  Again, you did us an incredible honor by being here and honoring and appreciating the 6,100 women and men of the Commissioned Corps.  We do say women and men; we are a 55 percent female service and the most diverse within the country.
I’m going to take a few minutes and talk about testing.  As both the Vice President and the Secretary said, we’re a world different than we were in March.  At that time in early March, we’d only done a few thousand tests.  Now we’re doing 550, 600 thousand.  We’ve actually gone over 600,000 per day, on occasion; over 33 million tests.
And I think all of you know there’s some components to this.  There’s, sort of, the front end — somebody to take the swab or to supervise you doing that swab.  You got to have the supplies there, you got to have the machines, and you got to have the laboratory tests.
So on the front end, way back in March, this had to be done by a practitioner, with a very deep nasal pharyngeal swab in full PPE.  We could not get to where we are today, from there, without a lot of science and a lot of collaboration from the FDA.
Because we’re able to validate nasal self-swabbing, those 41 sites turned into what you saw today, in the press, over 600 retail pharmacy sites that have now been extended for several months, continuing from their first June 30th closure now, at least through August, where there’s supervised self-swabbing.  That has translated into another 1,400 CVS sites.  So now 2,000 retail pharmacy sites, born from those first 41, in over 1,300 federally qualified health center sites.  Again, most of these focused on the most underserved communities and vulnerable communities.
So we’re scaling that, and every week we’re getting new authorizations from the FDA to take it the next step further, and that’s home self-swabbing.  There are some authorizations that are home self-swabbing and some that are video assisted, so we could eliminate a lot of the whole front-end problem where we are.
As I said many times, we’re scaling testing on a routine basis.  And I’ve told you that, assuming no technological innovations, we will easily be at 40 to 50 million tests available by September.  That’s a very conservative estimate — very conservative estimate — because the industry tells us we’ll be at a much higher place.
But what are some of the innovations we’re seeing right now being implemented, again, under the guidance of the FDA, validated, high quality?  And that’s pooling.  You’ve heard — you’ve heard something about pooling.  Pooling is very helpful because it could combine more than one sample in a single laboratory assay.
So imagine this situation where I wanted to know if all of you were potentially negative, and I thought you were probably negative because you don’t have a history, you’re not febrile, you haven’t been in contact with anyone.  So you could collect your own swabs, you can put them in tubes, and we can take all of those tubes, or at least 10 of them, and put them into a simple tube and do that assay.  If that one single assay is negative, then you’re all negative, if you do it appropriately.  So you can leverage 2 times, 5 times, possibly even up to 10 times or even more.
This is being done now in many universities and many commercial laboratories, and we are absolutely working with everyone in the community to do this.  It’s not right all the time, but it’s right a lot of the time.  So of those 18, 20 million tests per month that we’ll probably be doing in July, or out of those 35 to 50, 60 million tests we’re doing in September, you can do the math and multiply at least a portion of those by two, three, or even five.  So that’s where pooling is going to get us.
The final thing I would like to say is, the RADx program, that’s the diagnostics program at NIH, as well as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, are really making great inroads to innovation.  This was funded to sort of get us to the next step, to provide more rapid tests, higher quantities of tests, completely different kinds of tests.
Now, again, we’re not assuming any breakthrough innovations, but there’s going to be some, and I’m very excited about that.  The NIH Director Francis Collins, the BARDA Director Dr. Gary Disbrow, and I work on literally on a daily basis to make sure that the innovations that come on will be translated immediately to our public health system.
So I’d be happy to take your questions later on today.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Admiral Giroir, and thank you for your great efforts.  I know I speak for people all across this country when I express how proud we are of the extraordinary progress.
And the way we’ve scaled testing across America is historic.  When I was tapped to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we had done less than 8,000 coronavirus tests.  And to think that, in the intervening months, now 33 million tests and the ability to scale beyond that, it’s a — it is a great comfort to the American people and a great tribute — a great tribute to the public-private partnership that President Trump forged early on.
I think it’s also been historic to see the progress that we’ve made on personal protective equipment and particularly for Americans in the four states where 50 percent of the cases are occurring, or the 12 states where we’re seeing a combination of rising cases in positivity.  We want the American people to know that the personal protective equipment for our healthcare providers is also at a historic level.
And I’ve asked Admiral John Polowczyk to come and to articulate where we stand to date with the hospitals and healthcare facilities in the impacted areas, and our ongoing effort to ensure that the extraordinary doctors and nurses and healthcare workers that are, at this very hour, ministering to Americans struggling with the coronavirus have the masks, the gowns, the gloves, the ventilators, and all the personal protective equipment they need to render that care.
But Admiral Polowczyk?
ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you Mr. Vice President.  Back in March, mid-March, when I was moved from the Pentagon to FEMA, the President gave me one task: Provide our healthcare workers the supplies they need, what they need, when they need it.
And I’m going to give you a short update today, and I think the theme is: “We have more” — “They have more.”
So, from that time in March, mid-March until now, we are in a fundamentally better position.  I’m going to go through some details that makes me that confident.  And personally — those that personally know me, I’m a my glass half full type of person.  And so for these — these details I find very encouraging.
As we, over the last few weeks, tried to ascertain how well states and hospital networks are preparing, and preparing for the summer into the fall, we held a round of state calls with every state emergency manager and every state health official facilitated by the FEMA regional administrator.  So we went through every region and every state, and had a discussion about what we were doing for the National Stockpile and what they were doing for their states.
That call led me to believe that 65 to 70 percent of the states have at least 30 days of supply on hand, if not 60.  There are many states that have more than 60, that have targets of 90, and looking to achieve that.  Those state calls have made me confident of the numbers that we’re putting into our modernized National Stockpile.
Here in recent weeks, with the uptick in cases, where Dr. Birx has highlighted down to the county level, my team has called those hospitals.  And I am here to provide a synopsis of that.  We’ve talked to hospitals in Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, and on down the line.  Many of them are reporting 30 to 40 days of supply on hand.  Now, there are some sporadic shortages, but mostly in the size of — the size of masks.  “Could I have more small masks?”
So we took that information, and I talked to 3M today, as a matter of fact.  And they’ve already changed — based on the discussions with my team, they’re already changed their production to produce more small and extra-small masks.  So essentially, almost an even split — 40, 45, 50 percent were smalls, to then the — to the rest to normal supplies.
So states are saying they have supplies.  Hospitals and areas where there are outbreaks are having more supplies.
Another data tool: The National Health Safety Network, where — the CDC-run network where hospitals report days of supplies on hand across the nation — those supplies, back in March — there were many hospitals that were saying that they had less than three days.  Now folks have multiple weeks — the majority of hospitals.  So we are — we are fundamentally in a different place.
One of the things we did was we assembled all of the business-system data for the medical supply chain — for the commercial medical supply chain.  I have that (inaudible) at FEMA.  And I can see the demand from hospitals and the supply to them.  And those numbers are coming together, where supply is getting much closer to demand — all at the same time that states are stockpiling, municipalities are stockpiling, hospitals are stockpiling, and the federal government — with the Health and Human Services, Strategic National Stockpile — is being replenished.
So let me — let me shift topics to the nursing home project just real quick.  We’re on our second round of the nursing home project.  You know, those give a little bit more than a week’s worth of supply each.  Each round has, you know, almost 2 million sets of eye protection; 14 million masks; 63 million gowns — gloves; and 13 million gowns to get to the 15,000-plus nursing homes.  We’re 60 percent through this second round, and 45 percent have been delivered.
And finally, let me just touch on ventilators.  So back in March, the National Stockpile had approximately 19,000 ventilators.  Today, ready for deployment, we have 48,000.  By next week, if the production schedules hold, we’ll have 55,000.  So we are — we are in a fundamentally different place for supplies than we are.
Pending your questions later, Mr. Vice President, that’s all I have.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you.
And one other area where we’ve made great strides and we hope and pray to make good strides in the months ahead has been in the area of therapeutics and in the headlong pursuit of vaccines.  And when we see the extraordinary decline in fatalities over the last two months, it is a tribute, first, to our healthcare workers, to all that they’ve done — but it’s also a tribute to the availability of what are known as therapeutics — medicines like remdesivir; the new steroid treatment that you all have heard about; the availability of plasma treatments.
And I wanted to Dr. Steve Hahn of the FDA to update us on the medicines, as well as where we stand on vaccines.
Dr. Hahn.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  President Trump asked the FDA early on in the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce any unnecessary regulatory barriers to get medical products into the hands of Americans.  And FDA created an emergency review and development program for therapies called the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, and we have supported that program since that time, and it continues to this day.
I’d like to first start by telling you that the pipeline of therapeutics treatments that we see across this country — the great academics, researchers, private sector — that pipeline is very robust.
Currently — currently, as a recent count, FDA is monitoring more than 144 active trials of therapeutic agents for COVID-19, and another 457 development programs for therapeutic agents is in the pipeline.
So we’re at a vastly different place than we were three months ago, two months ago.  The nation’s work is paying off, as we saw the positive results of the recent National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease trial of remdesivir in certain hospitalized patients with a significant 30 percent reduction in the length of hospital stay for severe COVID-19 patients.
We also recently updated the clinical guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, with the addition of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids, with a trial that reported a 30 percent reduction in mortality in severely ill patients.
Those two therapies alone will have a significant impact on the natural history and the course of this disease, and provides great hope for those who get sick with this and are hospitalized.
But our work isn’t done; more is in the pipeline.  As I mentioned, over 25,000 patients in the United States have been treated on our expanded access convalescent plasma program.  Now, just as a reminder, that’s where we take antibodies — the antibodies that are naturally developed by someone who has gotten the COVID-19 virus and then has recovered — and then we administer that to someone who’s sick with COVID-19.
This has worked in other diseases in the past.  We have some preliminary safety data in over 20,000 patients.  It shows that this therapy is safe.  And we’re currently evaluating the efficacy of this — the effectiveness of this program.  We have great hope for that.
Now that information will tell us a lot about, if a person develops antibodies, how protective are those antibodies — what level do you need.  And it also gives us information for the next set of therapeutics that are coming down the pike.
Already, in clinical trials, we have a number of agents called “monoclonal antibodies,” which are synthetic forms of antibodies — so, genetically engineered antibodies that can then be given.  Again, these have been used in other infectious diseases, and we have hope that they would also work in these disease — in COVID-19.  And we expect the readout of those trials over the next several months, possibly late summer and early fall.
So I just want to switch gears to talk about vaccines.  Under the leadership of Secretary Azar and Operation Warp Speed, we have seen the sponsorship of a number of different vaccines.  But we know that vaccines are being developed around the world, and FDA has received applications from a double-digit number of sponsors regarding vaccines.
Four vaccines have been approved for moving into clinical trials — that is, authorized to go into clinical trials so we can get the data on those vaccines — and another six are in the pipeline for us to review.
We’ve seen recent reports of interesting and, I think, positive data regarding the immunogenicity — that is, how well these vaccines stimulate an immune response in people and also regarding their safety.
More work needs to be done, but I think we’ve seen some positive results to date.  And obviously, we need to make sure that those studies mature so that we can have the data we need.
Now, FDA recognizes the need and urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19, and we’ve been working collaboratively with all industry and all of our partners in academia, as well as in government, on that.
Today, we took additional action to facilitate the timely development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 by providing new guidance with recommendations for those developing COVID-19 vaccines.  And the goal of this guidance is to assist in the clinical development, and ultimately, hopefully the licensure of a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
Now, it’s very important to have this guidance because it provides regulatory transparency and clarity to the developers — what is FDA expecting to see in terms of data and science in the context of clinical trials — so that we can make the absolute best decision for the American people.
Now, while the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in order to approve a vaccine, and we will make clear through this guidance what data are needed to meet our regulatory standards.
I remain cautiously optimistic about our timeline with respect to vaccines.  We will see what the data show.  But clearly, from a therapeutics point of view, there are more tools in the toolbox for the great providers of this country to treat patients with COVID-19.
And then finally, I’d like to add to what the Vice President said, and that is: Mask wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene, and other forms of hygiene — this is how we’re going to keep America open again.  I’ve heard from colleagues around the country, my former colleagues in cancer care, from friends and families — nobody wants to shut down again.  Our way of keeping open is with these public health measures.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Hahn.
And as you can see, we’re in a much better place, whether it be testing, whether it be personal protective equipment, whether it be ventilators, or whether it be the availability of medicines that are speeding relief to Americans struggling with coronavirus.
And I — and I promise you that, as the President has directed from the very beginning, we’re going to continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of governors and states that are being impacted by the latest outbreak of the coronavirus.
But as we said at the beginning, we’re all in this together and we all have a role to play.  And so I wanted to ask the Surgeon General to bring a few remarks about — about how every American can play their part to slow the spread, to put into practice the kind of personal habits that will ensure not just that they protect their own health or the health of a family member or friend, but most especially, as has been said already, we see that roughly half of the new cases in Texas and Florida, we are told, are among Americans under the age of 35, for whom the threat of serious outcomes from the coronavirus is fairly low.
But it’s not just about protecting yourself as a young person; it’s about making sure that anyone who is vulnerable to a serious outcome with the coronavirus is protected.  No one of any age would ever want to inadvertently expose a mother, a father, a grandmother, or a grandfather.
And what the Surgeon General will share with us are the kind of practices that will make it possible for all of us to do our part to slow the spread, to heal our land, even as we continue to open up America again.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Good evening, everyone.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here at Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Headquarters today.  We very much appreciate it.
And I just want to start off by saying that we absolutely cannot afford to lose focus on the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on vulnerable communities, particularly communities of color.
Compared to whites, American Indians and Alaskan Natives are hospitalized at five times the rate; black Americans hospitalized at four and a half times the rate; Hispanics three and a half times the rate.
The fact is, this virus is exploiting and exacerbating preexisting health disparities, and these disparate outcomes and equitable opportunities for health are part of the anger, the frustration, and the fear that we’re seeing manifest in protests around the country.
The fact is, social justice and social injustice often reveals itself through health inequities, and the administration and my office are using our unique levers, including the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, to ensure that every American has the opportunity to be healthy.
At Secretary Azar’s direction, we’ve been working at HHS to address these disparities long before the pandemic.  But in response to the pandemic, we’ve taken a number of additional immediate actions.  And as we’re talking about both the burden of disease in our communities, but the resources that are now available to folks to help respond, I want to quickly run down some of these efforts.
Admiral Giroir has led our increase in community-based testing — over 600 sites.  Seventy percent of them are in communities that have a high social vulnerability index, which means they’re disproportionately serving people of color.
CDC now requires all testing data reported by states to include information on race, ethnicity, and ZIP Code.  This mandate will help us better understand who is most affected and how to target interventions on the hardest-hit communities.  HHS recently allocated $15 billion to Medicaid providers and $10 billion to safety-net hospitals which serve large numbers of our most vulnerable Americans.
The administration has also invested critical resources in community health centers — which I often say are our best kept secrets — ensuring that 28 million people living in medically underserved areas have access to care and testing that they need.  We don’t want our federally qualified and community health centers to be secrets to the people who most can benefit from the care that they receive there.
And Secretary Azar — and I want to thank you for this, sir — has instructed my office to expedite calls to action on hypertension — which is the number one risk factor for COVID complications — and maternal mortality, both of which disproportionately impact people of color.  And I am very worried about infant mortality and maternal mortality going up in the midst of COVID because women are scared to go out and get care.  We need to safely reopen so that people can get the care that they need beyond COVID.
Last week, you heard Admiral Giroir announce that Morehouse School of Medicine was awarded $40 million as part of a cooperative agreement with the Office of Minority Health.  This effort will be a major leap forward and help us achieve our goal of delivering important COVID-19 updates and information in ways and through channels that best reach minority communities.
And speaking of reaching minority communities, we’re really digging into engagement with other folks.  So I had a phone call, last week, with over 100 different organizations that are embedded in communities.  Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the National Hispanic Medical Association, the National Association of Black Nurses, and over 100 other organizations were the phone call.  This administration — HHS — we’re committed to outreach to make sure that we can get the information to the people who most need to benefit from it.
And to the point of the VP’s visit here today.  One of the reasons I’m proud to be a leader in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is our mission to serve the underserved.  Having a Ready Reserve, which is the announcement that we made earlier today, will augment our efforts to eliminate health disparities and ensure everyone has the best chance at a long and healthy life.
One of eight uniformed services, the Public Health Service is the only one dedicated solely to protecting and promoting America’s public health.  By a number of metrics, we are the most diverse uniformed service.  Over 50 percent of our officers are female and only 40 percent identify as white and non-Hispanic.
We provide essential health services where most others do not go — dare not go, in some cases — to provide care for vulnerable and underserved populations.
The bulk of our officers are at Indian Health Service’s — Health Service’s facilities, and we have a large number of officers in the Bureau of Prisons — two communities that have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19.
We serve on the frontline of public health emergencies.  My first deployment was to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after three Category 5 hurricanes in a row hit those unfortunate territories.  We respond quickly to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and global public health emergencies like Ebola, as well as serve on humanitarian missions.
We also advanced innovation in science and work at the forefront of medical challenges like COVID-19, cancer, and the opioid crisis, providing new treatments and cures.
Which leads me to my finish.  We are in a much better place to treat COVID than what we were two months ago, four months ago, even just a few weeks ago.
You heard Admiral Polowczyk talk about how we are better supplied than what we were.  Doesn’t mean that it’s mission accomplished, but we are in a much better place now with PPE and with other supplies.  With steroids, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma, if you get COVID-19, we are in a much better position to get you out of the hospital safely.
But public health is all about prevention.  And I’m a leader in the Public Health Service Corps.  So, I want to talk about prevention.  My Surgeon General’s prescription — which I first announced to you all way back in March — three things: Number one, know your risk.  Are you at high risk?  Are you at low risk?  Are you at intermediate risk for COVID-19?
Number two, know your circumstances.  Are you in a community where rates are going up?  Are you in a community where rates are going down?  Are you going to a place where you can take precautions like being outside and social distancing?
And number three, know how to stay safe.  And that includes everything from making sure we’re taking basic precautions, to staying home if you’re at high risk or you’re going to a high-risk place.
The fact is, we’re seeing an increase in cases and an increase in hospitalizations in those under 40.  So we need everyone to follow our preventive guidelines.  Stay home if you’re sick.  Stay at home if you’re vulnerable.  And again, we know people are more vulnerable as they get older, but they’re also vulnerable if they have hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.  Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently went out.  Maintain six feet of distance between you and others when you’re out.  And please, please, please wear a face covering when you go out in public.  It is not an inconvenience.  It is not a suppression of your freedom.  It actually is a vehicle to achieve our goals.  It adds to your convenience and your freedom because it allows us to open up more places and it allows us places to stay open.  When you do not wear your face covering, we end up in a situation where you see higher rates of disease spread and you end up having to close places.  This mask, this face covering, actually is an instrument of freedom for Americans if we all use it.
Young people, I just want to close by asking you to work with us, please.  Work with us because I know that many of you feel like you’re not at risk or you’re not as high of a risk, but we need all of you to help protect the most vulnerable, but also to protect yourselves and to give you more options.
If you want the return of college football this year, wear a face covering.  If you want a chance at prom next spring, wear a face covering.  I had a interview earlier with a North Carolina radio station; if you want to see North Carolina beat Duke in person this year, wear a face covering.  And I grew up in Maryland and in Indiana, so sorry, Duke, but I — as long as somebody beats you, I’m okay with that.  (Laughter.)  If you want to go on spring break next March, next April, wear a face covering.
I want you all to understand that this is not meant to be pessimistic.  I am actually confident, based on the data we’ve seen around the country and around the world, that if we do the right things, we actually can reopen and stay open.
COVID time is a long time.  In just a few weeks, we can drastically see things go in the wrong direction, but we also can drastically see things improve.  If you all will commit to wearing these face coverings and taking basic public health precautions, as the nation’s doctor, as America’s doctor, I want you to know I have every confidence that we can very quickly see these new case counts go down, and we can reopen, we can get back to school, to work, to worship, and to college football.
But we’ve all got to do our part.  It’s up to you, America.  If you join in and we all do our part, we all win.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Adams.  Thank you so much.  We’ve got time for a few questions.
Great.  Mario.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-rockville-mdxz/

3:49 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  The front page of the New York Times is not the venue for discussing classified information.  The White House podium is not the venue for discussing classified information.  We are here today, having this discussion, because of an irresponsible, anonymous leak to the New York Times.  There is no good scenario as a result of this New York Times report.
Who’s going to want to cooperate with the United States intelligence community, who’s going to want to be a source or an asset, if they know that their identity could be disclosed?  Which allies will want to share information with us if they know that some rogue intelligence officer can go splash that information on the front page of a major U.S. newspaper?
Specifically, there are two bad scenarios that emerge from this report: Number one, this report makes it more difficult to come to a consensus on this matter, to verify intelligence.  And number two, this level of controversy and discord plays directly into the hands of Russia and, unfortunately, serves their interests.
Since before President Trump assumed office, damaging and oftentimes erroneous leaks seeking to undermine or delegitimize the duly elected president have been published.  According to the DOJ, classified leaks surged in this administration.  There were, under President Obama, just 39, on average, criminal leak referrals.  In this administration, we’ve seen 100 criminal leak referrals to the DOJ in 2017, 88 in 2018, and 104 on average per year.
We have seen targeted leaks of classified information against this President, and it is irresponsible: phone calls with foreign leaders, meetings with government officials, and now reports of alleged intelligence.  Make no mistake: This damages our ability, as a nation, to collect intelligence.
As the National Security Council noted just yesterday, “To those government officials who betray the trust of the people of the United States by leaking classified information, your actions endanger our national security.”
The ODNI said, “The selective leaking of any classified information disrupts the vital interagency work to collect, assess, and mitigate threats, and places our forces at risk.  It is also, simply put, a crime.”
And finally, the CIA said this: that “Leaks compromise and disrupt the critical interagency work to collect, assess, and ascribe culpability.”
To the anonymous sources who leak classified information, you should know this: You may seek to undermine our President, but in fact, you undermine our country’s safety and our country’s security.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

1:25 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Law and order are the building blocks to the American Dream, but if anarchy prevails, this dream comes crum- — comes crumbling down.  Anarchy in our streets is unacceptable, and anger is not enough.  You have a President committed to action.
The DOJ has arrested over 100 anarchists for rioting and destruction of federal property.  The DOJ has also charged four men in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  The FBI has over 200 open domestic terrorism investigations ongoing.  AG Barr has created a task force on violent anti-government extremists led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Northern Texas.
With 200 Trump-appointed judges confirmed, the rule of law will be upheld.  Democrats at all lev- — at all levels — federal, state, and local — have done nothing.  Senate Democrats blocked bipartisan police reform.  Minnesota’s Democrat governor failed to urgently deploy the National Guard — it took President Trump for that to eventually happen; his suggestion — and the ultimate descendance into chaos there in Minneapolis.
Three Democrat Minneapolis councilmembers voted to abolish the police, while they themselves were getting a private security detail.  That’s quite rich.
Democrat mayor of Seattle called the CHOP zone — the autonomous zone — “the summer of love.”  It is anything but that with one dead, multiple shootings, and desperate pleas for help unanswered by business owners and others.
Eleven people were shot in 12 hours this weekend in the Democrat-run New York City.  And 61 people were shot in Democrat-run Chicago, and 15 fatally killed — a Democrat state, a Democrat city.
President Trump stands against defunding our brave police officers, caving to mob rule, and cancel culture which seeks to erase our history.
Let’s be clear: The rampant destruction of statues is not a part of any ideology, but this anarchy is aided by failed Democrat leadership.  And as President Trump has tweeted, these statues, quote, “are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage, both the good and the bad.  It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and to learn from them.”
So let’s stand for law and order, for peace in our streets, and against anarchy.  This is President Trump’s vision for the future.
And with that, I’ll take questions.

MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  This past Father’s Day weekend, we saw violence across the country, but we saw scant media coverage of this violence.
Let’s be clear here: The states are responsible for policing their streets.  The governors, the mayors are responsible for ensuring that our streets are safe, that the American people are protected.  And what we have seen is, in far too many Democrat-runs states and Democrat-run cities, we have seen violence and chaos and nothing like the law and order that we saw here in D.C. when President Trump stepped in and surged the National Guard.
In Chicago, for instance, we saw over 100 people were shot and 14 tragically killed, including a three-year-old was among the victims.  And one local news outlet tragically reported that multiple teenagers were killed in Chicago this weekend as well.
In Minneapolis, 11 people were shot and one person killed.  One individual was a father of two who worked as a barber and our hearts break for this family.
Also in Democrat-run New York City, we saw that the New York Post reported that there was one shooting per hour this Saturday — absolutely inexcusable — with 24 people shot on Saturday alone.
And then in Democrat-run Seattle, we’ve seen the autonomous zone, otherwise known as “CHOP” — C-H-O-P.  One person was shot and killed in this autonomous zone run by radical anarchists.  And also, we saw another shooting there yesterday as well.  And the Democrat mayor of the city called CHOP, quote, “the Summer of Love,” but it has been nothing of this sort, clearly, with two individuals shot, one person shot and killed.
It is the responsibility of governors to protect their states, to police their streets.  The police power rests at the state level.  And we expect mayors to step up and to do their job, and governors to step up and do their job in the mold of President Trump, who secured D.C. after a night of lawlessness two weeks ago.
Finally, the Defund Police movement is misguided.  It will only hurt the vulnerable citizens of American cities the most.  It’s sad, and it is shameful.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-062220/

1:34 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon everyone.  The great American comeback is underway.  Just before joining you all, we learned from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that unemployment has fallen in 43 states in May, as Americans are going back to work.
Also, I would like to reemphasize the numbers that Director of the NEC Larry Kudlow shared with you all yesterday that the CBO predicted that, in the third quarter, we will get plus-20 percent GDP.  They’ve predicted in Q4, we will be at plus-20 percent GDP.  And top economist Ed Hyman says that, in Q1 of 2021, he is predicting plus-5 in GDP.  And this would put GDP above its 2019 peak.  That’s right.  So pre-coronavirus numbers, should those predictions pan out.  We are back and we will be booming.
Finally — well, second to finally, we are encouraged that we continue to gather positive data on a number of therapeutics.  Heparin, dexamethasone — or steroids, is as it’s more commonly known; convalescent plasma; and remdesivir have all shown promise in treating coronavirus.  Preliminary findings in a large, UK-based recovery trial found that when steroids were used, there was a 30 percent reduction in death for coronavirus patients on ventilators.  The FDA is reviewing this recovery trial data now.
Additionally, on convalescent plasma, there is more encouraging news.  In partnership with Mayo Clinic, the Trump administration moved very quickly on this therapy in its earliest days, recognizing that it showed promise.  Though the — through the FDA, Mayo Clinic, and the administration’s work and our hand-in-hand partnership, we’ve found that this treatment is very promising.  This has shown that the administration has left no stone unturned in looking at every possible treatment at the very earliest stages.
The lead investigator of this Mayo Clinic study, Dr. Michael Joyner, summed up his work, in saying that convalescent plasma, quote, “continues to look promising,” end quote, noting the, quote, “excellent news” of this study, which covered a diverse population of patients.  About 20 percent were African American, nearly 35 percent Hispanic, 5 percent Asian, and 40 percent women.
Prior experience with respiratory viruses in some data that have emerged globally suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness caused by COVID-19.  The results from Mayo underscore that promise.
As you can see, the Trump administration and FDA lead on identifying convalescent plasma as a therapeutic and the results are encouraging.
Finally, I wanted to share some words from President Trump:  Juneteenth reminds us of both the unimaginable injustice of slavery and the incomparable — incomparable joy that must have attended emancipation.  It is both a remembrance of a blight on our history and a celebration of our nation’s unsurpassed ability to triumph over darkness.  That ability is rooted in the fundamental goodness of America, in the truths upon which we, as a nation, declared an end to our status as the subjects of a monarch and emerged as a free and independent people — those truths that all men are created equal by the hand of God, endowed by our Creator with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.

MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Great to join you today.  So, five years ago today, nine innocent parishioners of a historically black church were killed during an evening Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina.  We all remember that tragedy, and this was a despicable act of evil that happened five years ago today.  So we remember that somber day at that Charleston church, as our hearts still break for the victims and our prayers go out to the families.
Yesterday, President Trump led and brought our nation together behind real, meaningful, substantial change to ensure that we have safe streets and safe policing.  Part of that was having an incentive structure to implement the highest professional standards in our police departments through an accreditation process.
This accreditation entails making sure you have de-escalation practices in place, use of force tactics in place.  Part of that is prohibiting chokehold, except in the event where lethal force is used.  It also incentivizes information sharing and makes sure that if they have an officer who’s had multiple uses of excessive force, that that information is sent to a national database.
And then, finally, another prong of this was having co-responders, who are experts in mental health, going alongside law enforcement, because we know law enforcement officials often have to deal with mental health, homelessness, and addiction.  And having a co-responder, who is an expert in this process, will go a long way.
This is project — progress.  It’s tangible action.  And it’s solutions.
And today, Senator Tim Scott said this is “not a binary choice” between supporting police officers and between supporting victims of grave injustices, like George Floyd.  It’s not a binary choice.  There are not sides here.  This is about America coming together.  This is about human decency.  And this is about justice.  And when we see injustices, we recognize them.
As President Trump said yesterday, all children deserve equal opportunity because we are all made equal by God.  That is so true.
First, let me point out that I have sat across from a police officer family that lost their loved one.  I saw a little girl named Charlie, who will forever grow up without a father; who will forever grow up without a father for prom, for the father-daughter dance.  And it was heartbreaking to know that she lost her father, who was a valiant hero.
But yesterday, I sat across from families who lost their loved ones in mass instances of injustice.  And it was heartbreaking to hear their stories.  It was a real tragedy.  It was a tearful moment.  It was an emotional moment.  And it’s one that the President, when I asked him in the Oval Office about it afterwards, he said this: “I love those families.  I want to help those families.”  And President Trump means that.  Because this is about humanity.  That is ultimately what this is about.
And Senator Scott shared a very beautiful Bible verse with those families yesterday, and I just want to read it here, to close.  Romans 8:28: “And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to his purpose.”  He shared that Bible verse with those families, and it was particularly meaningful to me and, I think, to the families, as well.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-061720/

2:48 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, I’m sorry we are very late, you guys.  I’m sorry to keep you waiting.  I was working with the President on something, and he wanted me to hand this out to you all.  And I have it here, so I want to read it to the American public, directly from the President:
“It has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our legendary military bases, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina; Fort Hood in Texas; Fort Benning in Georgia.”  And the list goes on.  “These monumental and very powerful bases have become part of a great American heritage and a history of winning, victory, and freedom.  The United States of America trained and deployed our heroes [here]…and won two world wars.  Therefore, my administration will not even consider the renaming of these magnificent and fabled military installations.  Our history, as the greatest nation in the world, will not be tampered with.  Respect our military!”
So that was directly from the President.  And we spent some time working on that, and I wanted to deliver that to you.
Also, I wanted to take us through a few other things relating to the coronavirus.  First, the coronavirus task force briefing was held yesterday.  I was in it, and there was some very good news that I’d like to share with you.  I don’t know if you all saw; there were two studies that came out — very strong studies — in the journal, Nature.  And in Europe, which had a very similar epidemic profile to the United States, 3.1 million lives were saved due to mitigation and the efforts taken by the European governments.  And as Dr. Birx noted to me — she sent this to me just before I walked out here — she said it suggests that the United States also prevented over 3 million deaths, thanks to the efforts of President Trump and the American people.
Another study found that the shutdown efforts prevented 50 million additional coronavirus cases.  So those are two very encouraging studies underscoring the work of the American people.
Also, the Washington Post noted that these two reports use completely different methods to reach similar conclusions.  They suggest that the aggressive and unprecedented shutdowns were effective at halting the exponential spread of the novel coronavirus.  So thank you, Washington Post, for that good reporting.
The Department of Agriculture, Secretary Sonny Perdue also had some very good news in the task force briefing I was at yesterday.  America’s meatpacking facilities — at one time, it looked like they were going to need to close; that was unacceptable to the administration.  So we took action — the coronavirus task force took action — and now I’m pleased to report that these meatpacking facilities are operating at 95 percent capacity compared to 2019.  We have beef operating at 98 percent capacity, pork at 95 percent, and poultry at 98 percent.
Throughout America’s extraordinary efforts to slow the spread, President Trump ensured that the meat supply chain stayed functional and robust by directing these meatpacking facilities to safely operate in accordance with the CDC and OSHA guidelines.  His efforts secured America’s continual access to a steady food supply chain.
And then, finally, and very importantly, I have some great data points to share on coronavirus testing capacity and minority communities.  Admiral Brett Giroir shared this with me yesterday and last night as well: He said that when we look at testing sites, President Trump’s public-private partnership with retail companies has proven quite successful.  Testing sites are operating in 49 states with 70 percent of these sites located in communities with moderate to high social vulnerabilities.  And social vulnerability takes into account race, ethnicity, housing and economics, language barriers, and other factors.
Also, federally qualified health centers — they’re FQHCs — serve 29 million patients in 12,000 communities across the nation.  They provide care to one in five of those uninsured, one in five rural Americans, one in five of — one in three of individuals below the poverty line, and more than 1.3 million homeless men and women, and nearly a million migrant agricultural workers.  And 92 percent of these FQHCs now offer COVID test.  And we’ve awarded them $583 million to 1,385 of these facilities.
And finally, finally — I promise my last announcement:  The HHS Office of Minority Health issued a competitive funding opportunity to build a strategic network of national, state, territory, tribal, local, and community-based organizations that deliver vital health information and support linkages to services for racial and ethnic minorities.  And this — this announcement — this network is scheduled to be awarded at the end of June and is expected to reach at least 40 million individuals from racial and ethnic minorities.
These updates, I was told by Brett Giroir, were received very well at the Senate hearings.  And we thank the Vice President, Mike Pence, for doing an amazing job leading our coronavirus task force, and to President Trump, who has led in bringing America through the coronavirus pandemic.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-061020/

MS. MCENANY:  Hello everyone.  The transition to greatness has officially begun.  Friday’s jobs report was encouraging, to say the absolute least.  The jobs in this country — we had more than 2.5 million added.  The prediction was that 7.5 million jobs would be lost.  This was a 10 million swing toward the positive side and, in fact, the greatest number of jobs created in a single month on record.  That is extraordinary.  225,000 manufacturing jobs, 464,000 thousand construction jobs, and 1.2 million leisure and hospitality jobs were all added in May.
Beyond that, the number of workers who reported being on temporary layoffs decreased by 2.7 million in May.  And more than that — and this was a great number that was pointed out to me today by the CEA — 300- — 300,000 jobs were created for black Americans in particular.  That’s in May, and that was a 1.7 percent increase.  So very encouraging numbers there from the CEA that they highlighted for me — BLS numbers that they highlighted.
May’s jump in average weekly hours also was an encouraging sign because increasing hours is a sign that employees need to hire — employers need to hire more workers to meet demand.  For all private-sector employees, average weekly hours increased by 0.5 percent to 34.7 hours — the highest level since the series began in 2006.  Seventy-three percent of small businesses are open.  That is up from the 52 percent right before the April jobs report reference period.  Also, workplace visits are up roughly 40 percent from its pandemic low.
The stock market is absolutely soaring.  We saw with the S&P that it had its greatest 50-day rally in history.  The Dow, likewise, is also booming.  The markets clearly have confidence in President Trump — the jobs President who created the hottest economy in modern history once and will do it again.
Also commentators and economists have noted how great this jobs report was.  Yesterday, we saw Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, say this will go down in history as the biggest positive data shock for the markets and the economy.  And you saw how surprised the markets were.  They surged on Friday, capping a strong week, with the NASDA","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060820/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  So I’m going to start with a few housekeeping announcements.  First of all, the President’s annual physical results are ready for release.  The full memo will be released shortly.  But in summary, the President remains healthy.
Also, I’d like to congratulate the winners of last night’s primary elections.  President Trump has now endorsed candidates and has a 64 to 0 record in congressional, special, and primary election races since the midterms, demonstrating the strength of and support for the President’s agenda across the country as evidenced in the 64 consecutive congressional, special, and primary elections over the past 13 months.
So, next, I want to transition to talking about some of the things going on around the country.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to riot.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to loot.  The First Amendment doesn’t give anyone the right to burn down buildings.  The First Amendment does not give anyone the right to deface property.  And it does not give anyone the right to assault private citizens and to assault police officers.
The First Amendment, however, does give you the right to peaceably assemble.  And the greatest example that we have seen of peaceful protest, an absolute embodiment of the First Amendment, is the March on Washington.  On August 28, 1963, a quarter of a million Americans gathered at the Lincoln Memorial and peacefully made a powerful march and a powerful point: that all Americans should be treated equally; that racial discrimination was unacceptable, abhorrent, and that it needed to be rectified.
And in the famous “I Have a Dream” speech by Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, he said this: “We must not allow our creative protest to de”- — excuse me, “to degenerate into physical violence.  Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.”
And soul force is exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. met the nation with when he said this: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”  Important words, important actions from an American hero who contributed to making this nation the greatest on Earth.
With that in mind, we must remember to recognize the lives lost, the passing of George Floyd who was killed unjustly — in a horrific video that we all have seen.  And we must also remember the passing of police captain David Dorn yesterday, who was shot and killed by looters in St. Louis, in an absolute tragedy.  A retired officer, 77 years old, whose wife was also a police officer herself.  Dorn was a hero and an unfortunate casualty in the riots we have seen.  Our hearts are with his family.
We are all Americans.  We must come together.  We must unify.  And we must have law and order.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  Weijia.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060320/

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  The President has made clear that what we are seeing on America’s streets is unacceptable.  Violence, looting, anarchy, lawlessness are not to be tolerated, plain and simple.  These criminal acts are not protest.  They are not statements.  These are crimes that harm innocent American citizens.
The First Amendment guarantees the right of the people to peaceably assemble.  What we saw last night in Washington and across the country was not that.
To that end, President Trump is demanding action to protect American citizens, to protect American businesses.  Seventeen thousand National Guard are deployed in 24 states, but according to General Milley, only two states have deployed more than 1,000.  There are 350,000 National Guard available overall, and for the lawlessness we are seeing, far more needs to be done.
Governors across the country must act, deploy the National Guard as it’s fit, and protect American communities.  As President Trump has said repeatedly, it’s very important that we have peaceful protesters and support the rights of peaceful protesters, but we cannot allow a situation like what happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-060120/

2:14 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, I want to start by acknowledging the horrific tragedy in Minnesota of George Floyd.  The death of George Floyd is absolutely tragic — that video that we saw, that I saw, that my staff saw, that the President saw.
And the President put out a statement last night that, “At [his] request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd.  I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by law enforcement.  My heart goes out to George’s family and friends.  Justice will be served!”
I can tell you that as I’m briefing you at this moment, the President is receiving a briefing from the Attorney General, Bill Barr, on this and the Deputy Director of the FBI, as that is ongoing on as I began this briefing.
Secondly, I want to transition into some news from SBA and Treasury that was announced, that today, the U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, announced that it is setting aside $10 billion of round two funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to be lent exclusively to CDFIs.  Those are community development financial institutions.  CDFIs work to expand economic opportunity in low-income communities by providing access to financial products and services for local residents and businesses.  So we’re encouraged to see that.
And then, finally, before taking your questions, I wanted to address what has been going on on Twitter and with social media.  I believe it is time to, quote, “get the facts” about Twitter and other social media platforms targeting their bias against President Trump and conservatives online.
If we were to judge the bias of Twitter and its top employees by their own words, the case would be an easy one to make.  Twitter’s head of site integrity has tweeted that there are, quote, “actual Nazis” in the White House, and no fact-check label was ever applied to this absolutely outrageous, offensive, and false claim made against the White House and its employees.
But let’s judge Twitter based on their actions, not based on the words of its top employees.  And its actions are no better.  President Trump recently received a so-called “fact check” label for a tweet.  It was a false fact check, an inaccurate fact check, but nevertheless, Twitter moved forward with it.
Dan Scavino, the Deputy Chief of Staff here, was the first user in the history of Twitter to receive a so-called, quote, “manipulated media” label for posting a video that played a verbatim clip.  It is no coincidence that these two unbelievable interventions by Twitter were targeted against the President of the United States and one of the President’s top advisors.  This is bias in action.
And while big tech is quick to censor the President, quick to censor some of his top employees, they — they are very reluctant, it seems, to label some of the actions by Chinese officials, some of the misinformation that has been spread by China.  For example, to move off of Twitter and move to Google, they created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party, which blacklisted searches for human rights and allowed for easy surveillance.
Facebook and Twitter have both taken paid advertising that spread disinformation about China’s mass imprisonment of religious minorities.  And Twitter has allowed Chinese officials to use its platforms to spread misinformation about the coronavirus, undermine the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and more.
And then, back in March, a Chinese official began spreading a conspiracy theory on Twitter — an egregious one — that our U.S. military was responsible for the spread of the coronavirus.  And that tweet, that disinformation, it took all the way until today, when we raised concerns about it, to get a fact check.
So they appear to be very hastily eager to censor President Trump and some of his employees but a little reluctant when it comes to China.  It’s a bit befuddling.
But no one believes in the First Amendment more than the President.  The President will take action to ensure that big tech does not stifle free speech and that the rights of all Americans to speak, tweet, and post are protected.
And finally, I just want to note one other action of Twitter that I learned just before walking out here: that, on the Mueller report, their anti-Trump headlines were anti-Trump by a ratio of 76 to 1.  That’s extraordinary.  And it’s not just bias aimed at President Trump and his employees, it’s also aimed at everyday Americans.  It’s aimed at the movie “Unplanned,” as Twitter suspended their account and then came up with an excuse in the aftermath.
And then, just another example that liberals are allowed to incite violence against the Covington kids who were, in the end, proven right and their video was taken out of context, and yet these individuals were led — were allowed by Twitter to incite violence.  It’s very disturbing to see.
So those are some of the President’s concerns.  And with that, I will take questions.
Jim.  That’s a very nice tie, Jim, by the way.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052820/

Also skilled nursing facilities — there was an announcement that I just want to underscore that $4.9 billion in additional relief funds were distributed to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities, and these funds are provided under the CARES Act.
So just those two items for you this morning, and we’ll go ahead and we’ll start with questions.

1:48 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith.  I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they’ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time.
Today, I’m identifying houses of worship — churches, synagogue, and mosques — as essential places that provide essential services.
Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship.  It’s not right.  So I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.
I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now.  If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call.
These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united.  The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque.  Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life.
The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams, and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray.  I know them well.  They love their congregations.  They love their people.  They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else.
The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend.  If they don’t do it, I will override the governors.  In America, we need more prayer, not less.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
MS. MCENANY:  All right, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to join you today.  That was a great announcement from President Trump.  I’d like to introduce Dr. Birx right now.  She has a wonderful presentation pursuant to reopening America, and some great data to share with you.
So I’ll let her kick this off.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Kayleigh.  If we can have the first slide, please.
I wanted to start out with a summary of the number of Americans we have lost to date.  But the exciting thing for all of us is the decreasing mortality over time, and I think it both is a real aspect of the amazing healthcare workers on the frontline, the ability of people to share at the frontline how best to care for the patients and the continuous decrease in mortality over time.
Next slide.
The other thing that has decreased significantly over the last month is new hospitalizations.  We can see now that there’s over a 50 percent decline in new hospitalizations.  Although every region of the country is different, we are encouraged to see these new hospitalizations declining.
Next slide.
I’ve talked before about the extensive surveillance that CDC has made available to this country.  This is looking at their syndromic surveillance from emergency rooms.  You can see that both COVID-like illnesses shown in the orange, and shown in the blue, influenza-like illness — taking up both of those cases together — you can see significant declines week over week of number of people coming to the emergency room with these illnesses.  That goes along with our new hospitalizations.
What we like to do is triangulate data, put data together from multiple sources, to see if we’re seeing the same trends so that we can ensure that we’re making progress together.
Next slide.
This is their influenza-like illness surveillance system that has been up and running for more than a decade now.  You can see each of the influenza peaks of this last year.  I think that’s very important to remind people of because we had influenza A, influenza B, and then we had COVID-like illness.  And while we know it’s COVID — that’s the last orange peak — what we really find encouraging is, across the country, we are below baseline.  Why is that particularly important?  Now, these are reported state by state, county by county.  So each county will be able to see precisely where they are.  And then if there is changes in this, it becomes yet again an early alert system.
So I’ve showed you two early alert systems: one of them emergency rooms visits based on our syndromic illness qualifications that the CDC has up on their website, and then the influenza-like illness.  And again, to the American people, all of these are available on the CDC website under “COVID-19 Cases and Surveillance.”
Next slide.
Now, I want to show you — I’m going to go through these very quickly.  This is where we started; this is influenza-like illness, the red.  And the darker the red, the more significant the influenza-like illness is in that state.  So you want to get to green.
So this is the week ending March 28th.  I think many of us can remember what that week was, and this was when we were at the very beginning of our acceleration into logarithmic phase.
Next slide.
This is April 4th.  You’re starting to see some of the states already turn green.
Next slide.  April 11th, more of the country.  Next slide.  April 18th.  Next slide.  April 25th.
Next slide.  May 2nd.  And you can see — and I really call your attention to — there’s a orange area on this slide, and you can see that it’s the Maryland area, and we’ve been calling that out for a while, the high plateau in Maryland.  You can also see Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Next slide.
And then you can see Wisconsin still.  You can see Maryland is yellow.
Next slide.
And I want to turn just a moment, and I know that took you through a lot of slides quickly, but I think we can see, as a country, we have decreasing amount of illness, both at the emergency room and reported through the influenza-like illness.  Two of the surveillance systems at the CDC has up and running.  These come from the states; they come from the counties.  And many of the states have these also on their websites.
We talked earlier about how we had prioritized testing to the area that had the most significant disease.  And you can see now Rhode Island has led all of the states.  It’s almost up to testing 12 percent of all of their citizens.  It’s followed by New York, and you can’t see New York, but that’s the very next one.  New York and then North Dakota.  And so you can see that.  Well, you could.
Yeah, you could see that most of the high-burden areas of the United States had more than 6 percent testing.  That’s when I think you heard from Admiral Giroir we wanted every state to test at least 2 percent of their population during May.  You can see 100 percent of the states now are over 2 percent of their population.  And we’ll fix this slide so you can see every state, but many of the states now are over 4 percent.  And this is just after getting all the materials to ensure that they have adequate transport media and swabs.
So we’re encouraged by the progress that many of the governors and states have made in their testing of their population.  It is also why we took the opportunity to really encourage governors, and it was to encourage governors to test 100 percent of the nursing home residents and staff, because many of our outbreaks that we have seen over the last two months have started in nursing homes.
Next slide.
Now, this is a complicated slide, but this is trying to show you how we triangulate data.  So I took you through our surveillance systems.  I’m taking you now into the start of how we use laboratory data to really understand what’s happening, both in the metros and at the state level.
This is every single state.  And you can see the triangles — the top part that you can see, the little triangle-ly pieces or the diamonds — that is where the states were in the number of positive tests.  This is the nucleic acid test.  This is diagnosing virus in your nose.  You can see where it was 30 days ago and where it is now, by the red squares.
You can see a dramatic decline across the states.  And indeed, New York City, just six weeks ago, was almost 40 percent.  It is now, for the first time, as a New York — as a New York State, under 10 percent.
And so this is the progress that we’re making in both expanding testing, finding more people, but ensuring that we’re getting testing rates of about 10 percent.  This line is 10 percent.  So 42 states are — now have less than 10 percent test positive on a rolling seven-day average.
Now, again, I’m going to call your attention to the top three states — the top three states with the largest percent.  And this is so you can all make your decisions about going outside and social distancing, potentially playing golf, if you’re very careful and you don’t touch the flags and all of those issues; playing tennis with marked balls with just one other person so you’re only touching your ball.  We found, really, people who enjoy sports have been able to really adjust to social distancing.
But you can see the top three states are Maryland, the District, and Virginia.  And so there is still significant virus circulating here.  That is followed by Nebraska, Illinois — because of Chicago — and what we’ve talked about before about Minnesota.  So those are our top states as far as still having high number of test positives.
When I say high number of test positives, they’re all under 20 percent.  If I had shown you this slide four weeks ago, half of the country would have been over 20 percent.  So this also shows progress, but also very clearly about the region we’re living in right now with disease.
Next slide.
Now, I wanted you to see this as a metro, because that’s as a state level.  So we look at this in multiple different ways.  The number one metro with the highest positivity rate is the District of Columbia, which includes Northern Virginia and Maryland — Montgomery County and PG County.  That is followed by Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis.  And so these are the places where we have seen really a stalling or an increase of cases, as in Minneapolis.
You can see all the other metros — all the other metros are almost all exclusively below 10 percent.  So we see this as great progress across the board in the metro areas.
Next slide.
So we also look at daily cases and daily case numbers.  And I know that you all know that that’s a very erratic — and it depends sometimes on how the tests were reported, how the cases were reported, and so you often have to look at it over a three- or seven-day period.  This is looking at daily cases on a seven-day rolling average.  You can see the number one — the top peak that has now come down dramatically — is the New York metro area.
Underneath that, you can see our concerns about Chicago and our concern in the yellow line of the Washington, D.C. area, because these are two areas that went through the logarithmic  phase and are now at a high plateau with an unchanging number of cases day over day.  That’s the orange line and the yellow line.
You can see that the daily case numbers, per hundred thousand, are below the yellow line and the orange line of Washington, D.C. and Chicago.  And that’s New York, Boston, and many of the others.  Providence is also up as a per hundred thousand.  And that’s the way we like to look at it, because we can really then understand it in relationship to population.
The other groups that have very low levels that once had a peak — this is Detroit, a very low level now.  This is Boston in the gray, which has come way down also.  And you can see down here is Atlanta and Miami.
Next slide.
Now, sometimes, and I think recently, there have been publications about where the world was before we started the Stop the Spread and before many states shut down.  And to just to take you back to that moment: On March 14th, before Stop the Spread, this is showing New York.  I didn’t even put March 14th on there because New York, on March 14th, had less than 50 cases reported.  Chicago had less than 10.  Washington had less than 10.  LA had less than 20.  The large state, at that time, that had a significant number of cases was the Washington area — Washington State, which had 100 cases.
On March 14th, we had about 500 cases distributed around the United States, not in any dramatic hotspot per se, but the majority of those cases and the hotspot at that moment was Washington State.  This is how the New York metro area, which includes obviously northern New Jersey, northern parts of Pennsylvania, parts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and the dramatic decline that they’ve had in the number of cases.  And I know you know that also mortality has started to decrease in that northern New Jersey and New York area.
Next slide.
But I wanted you to see how we bring all this information together on a daily basis.  The red line in this graphic are the emergency room visits.  So those are the syndromic visits that I discussed with you at the beginning.  The blue line is the test positive.  And again, it’s very erratic because of the reporting of when cases sometimes from the entire weekend are added on a Monday morning.  And then you can see the actual case numbers in the black bars.
And so that’s how we bring everything together.  And what we want to see is all of the — all of the items trending down.  We want to see the number of positives that you find, because we really have states now looking for asymptomatic cases.  So we want to ensure that both asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases are all declining as shown in the blue line; that emergency room visits are declining; and the actual case numbers are declining together.  And of course, then there’s mortality behind that in the green lines that are — green bars that are hard for you to see.
Next slide.
But this is the Washington area.  And so that’s why I wanted you to see that contrast.  You can see there’s not been that dramatic decline in the blue line.  There’s not been that dramatic decline in the black bars of cases.  And there’s not been a dramatic decline in the emergency room visits with COVID-like illnesses.
So even though Washington has remained closed, LA has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases.  And I’ve asked the CDC, and the CDC is working with the local areas in Chicago, in this area, and LA to really understand where are these new cases coming from and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.
Next slide.
This is Chicago.  Again, just to show you going up into this high plateau that has been fairly persistent.
Next slide.
And this is Los Angeles.  So you can get a flavor of where we have concerns, of where cities have remained closed and metros that have remained closed but have still persistent high number of cases.
Next slide.
So then I wanted to talk to you about outbreaks, because throughout this all, there’s been a large part of America that has been — and many states — that have been really finding their outbreaks, containing those outbreaks by testing everyone, and doing contact tracing, and then stopping them and stopping those outbreaks in their tracks, what we have been talking about everybody being able to do across the United States.
And so this illustrates the counties that have had 100 percent increase in new cases over the last few days — over the last three days.
Now, the reason I wanted to show this is because I see more and more graphics out there that talk about cases going up versus cases going down.
Just to give you an example of Wyoming — and I think many of the groups now have Wyoming as a red state of cases going up.  Wyoming, three days ago, had five cases confirmed and today had — yesterday had nine.  So they qualify, almost, and show up as this large increase.  We — it’s a good alert for us.  We immediately look and look and see what exactly is happening at the state website.
But you can see, when you have very low number of cases, you can have a doubling from 5 to 10 number of cases and show up as 100 percent increase.  And so each of these have to be investigated separately to really understand what this is.  It is the way we find outbreaks in prisons.  It’s the way we have been finding outbreaks in nursing homes.  And we have this graphic.  It goes through all of the counties as well as — next slide.
So this is one state’s analysis.  And what they have shown — and they have been able to find each of their outbreaks, contain every one of their outbreaks, close those outbreaks, and call them closed cases.
In this case, the dark blue is community spread.  The rest of it, 50 percent of their cases, have been coming from outbreaks that they’ve been able to contain.
The largest group in this is meatpacking plants.  And what they’ve been doing is going in and testing 100 percent of the individuals in the meatpacking plant, and also finding 100 percent of the individuals that are associated with those individuals in the meatpacking plant.  They’ve been able to go into group housing, social gatherings.
So just as we discuss all of this, and when you go out for this weekend, Memorial Day, and you want to do some kind of social gathering, it’s very important to maintain that six-feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance cannot be maintained.
But it also talks about long-term care facilities.  Now, interestingly enough, 50 percent of their total cases, since they’ve been tracking, came from these outbreaks.  Almost 70- plus percent — 76 of all their mortality, though, came from these outbreaks.
And this is why we have been really pushing both in the original Opening up America Again, in the testing blueprint.  We talk about proactive surveillance, proactive monitoring and testing in areas that you know are particularly susceptible to outbreaks.
Every state has this knowledge now and this type of analysis.  And so when they have these kinds of analysis, what we’re asking them to do is proactively go and test everyone in meatpacking plants, to proactively go and test 100 percent of the residents and workers, and then a follow-up of the workers in every single long-term care facility.
And this is to find the asymptomatic cases.  I know CDC yesterday released that they thought 35 percent.  We started with the understanding that we thought it was around 11 to 15 percent, based on the experience with one of the Princesses.  But now we know it’s at least 35.  It may be greater than that because it may be so age dependent that there may be a lot of people under 30 that have the virus and are shedding the virus and aren’t aware that they have the virus.  And so, proactive monitoring, proactive testing will become absolutely critical to find these asymptomatic cases.
Next slide.
So this is my last slide.  And this is just to show you what an outbreak looks like.  So if you look at this axis, it’s normalized through 100,000 population.  But you can see — this is what we want to see.  We want to see very low case number.  We want to see that they’ve identified an outbreak, they tested 100 percent, they’ve contained 100 percent, and then they don’t find any more cases.
And so this is what’s happening across the country, county by county — this is a county map — to really show you the work that’s going on.  And since the last two months, we’ve gone from, I think, less than 4,000 contact tracers to nearly 50,000 contact tracers.  And this is what’s been happening behind the scenes.
But I really want to applaud the governors and state and health and local — the health — the health commissioners and the local health departments who have really been working quietly, in an unassuming way, to really find these cases, track these cases, isolate these cases, and ensure there’s no additional spread.  And you can see, in many of these instances, they’ve gone more than two weeks without any additional spread.
And so this is what we are hoping goes across the United States.  Now, we all have to admit, it’s going to be much more difficult in metro areas because you have to really identify where are those asymptomatic cases and how will you find them.  And it’s why there’s been a lot of additional resources go in — going into disadvantaged areas, into the federal community clinics to be able to proactively be able to test for this virus and find asymptomatic individuals.
When someone gets sick with COVID — excuse me — when someone gets sick with COVID, you’ve — you’ve heard the cases; some of them have very high fevers, and so they’re not out walking around.  So they may have been shedding virus for one or two days before they got significantly ill and they had to be in bed because they felt so terrible.
Now, think of that.  They were maybe out two days.  And so if they’re 50 percent of the cases, they’re only out for two of the days that they may be spreading virus.  An asymptomatic individual that doesn’t know they have COVID, they may be spreading and shedding the entire time that they’re in the community.  So instead of two days, it may be six days or it may be seven days.
And so when we talk about proportions, 35 percent that are asymptomatic, that are out in the community, is very — is much more opportunity for transmission than someone who is getting sick and is only out in the community for two days.  And so we know we have to find both, and we’ve been working with states about what proactive surveillance would look like in this case to find people who are asymptomatic.
But it’s also why we continue to recommend to the public, very clearly, that you can’t tell who’s infected.  And so that’s why you have to continue to social distance, that why — that’s why you need to continue to maintain six feet apart.
I remember in the early days of HIV, people told me all the time that they could — they knew who was infected.  And I would say, “You don’t know who’s infected.  I could be infected.  You’re just saying you don’t think I’m infected because I look healthy.”  There’s a lot of healthy people out there with COVID that look healthy.
And so we’re asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend, to play golf, to hike, as Dr. Fauci said, to play tennis with marked balls, and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with, and to even consider sharing social distance space, as long as you have utensils that are — belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately.  There’s a lot of things to think through.  I know you can do this.  I know the American people can do it.
And so, please, as you go out this weekend, understand you can go out.  You can be outside.  You can play golf.  You can play tennis with marked balls.  You can go to the beaches if you stay six feet apart.  But remember that that is your space, and that’s the space that you need to protect and ensure that your social distanced from others.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052220/

3:35 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to begin by detailing the historic private-public partnership effort launched by the Trump administration to combat the coronavirus.  As both a businessman and as President, you’ll all remember then-candidate Donald Trump, now President Donald Trump, being adamant about bringing manufacturing jobs back to America.
President Obama and the Democrats had given up on manufacturing with President Obama’s erroneously prediction that Trump would need a magic wand in order to bring back American jobs.  Not so.
The reality is President Trump revived manufacturing in this country, and he tore up disastrous trade deals that hemorrhaged American jobs, like NAFTA and like the plan that was in work, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Instead, he put in place better trade deals to bring back American jobs and to bring back American manufacturing.
And in the battle against the invisible enemy, President Trump took action to shore up our domestic supply chains in order to deliver the necessary PPE and other medical equipment to the states.
Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are currently promoting a 3-trillion-dollar liberal wish list, among a litany of Democrat priorities immaterial to the coronavirus crisis, are embedded in this, and one would require the President to appoint a, quote, “medical supplies response coordinator” who would, quote, “serve as the point of contact for the healthcare system, supply chain officials, and the states on medical supplies.”
I’m happy to report this individual already exists.  This bill ignores reality, because the medical supplies official is in existence; he’s been working on this since March to deliver, to date, over billions and billions — more than 1 billion, I should say, pieces of PPE to countries and hospitals across the country.
Since March 29th, Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, Vice Director for Logistics for the Joint Chiefs, has been on the job as the head of FEMA’s Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force.  This is a historic partnership with the private sector, and under the leadership of President Trump, FEMA directed the greatest mobilization of the private sector since World War Two.
Rear Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA quickly realized the power of the private sector in addressing the coronavirus, recognizing that the six largest private sector medical distributors would have the ability to source, procure, manufacture, and deliver as many as 1 billion pieces of PPE in a single week.  That is an extraordinary volume by our private sector.  And at the direction of President Trump, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA were able to harness this power.
Every day at 9:00 a.m., Rear Admiral Polowczyk’s team huddles with these six large private sector medical distributors and, together, they review data compiled by Dr. Birx, as well as information provided by the CDC, to set priorities and ensure sufficient levels of supplies go down not just to the county level but to the hospital level.
After focusing geographically, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and his team orients the data to set point-of-care distribution priorities for public hospitals, VA and DOD facilities, private hospitals, nursing homes, acute cli- — excuse me, acute care clinics, first responders, and labs.
In just two and a half weeks, Rear Admiral Polowczyk and his team were able to combine data streams, utilize supply chain visualization tools from DOD, and input data into the cloud.  This system is now available to generate reports for governors showing what their state received from the federal government and commercial partners all the way down to the hospital level, as I noted.
And thanks to President Trump and his administration, governors now have visibility as to where their supplies are sent and where they’re received.  And from March 1st through May 10th, this public-private partnership has led to the delivery — and these are extraordinary numbers — of over 113 million N95 respirator masks, nearly half a billion surgical masks, nearly 18 million face shields, and over 12 billion gloves.  That is a lot of PPE, and we thank our private sector partners for engaging in this effort with us.
Also, I just wanted to note that, earlier today, the President held an hour-long call with thousands of Hispanic community, business, and faith leaders across the country.  He recognized the many contributions of the Hispanic community to our country and addressed important issues, like how to reopen their businesses and build the greatest economy in history again.
And finally, before I take questions, I just wanted to note on a separate note that I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Ravi Zacharias, a renowned Christian apologist who left this world yesterday.  Our prayers are with Ravi’s family during this time.  He meant a lot to a lot of people around this administration.  And as my father said, Billy Graham was the great evangelist and Ravi Zacharias was the great apologist.  And we are all thinking about him and holding him close to our hearts and his family today.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-052020/

2:40 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Sorry we’re a little late today.  As you know, the President had two events this morning, so we didn’t want our unprecedented transparency to get in the way of lunch, so we’re glad that you all had a few moments there to eat.  So our delay was hopefully useful and helpful to you guys.
I have an announcement on the Trump administration’s unwavering support for our farmers.  Today, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and senior advisor Ivanka Trump announced the launch of the Farmers to Families Food Box program.  This is a $3 billion program to support farmers and provide food to our most vulnerable communities.  Senior advisor Ivanka Trump and Secretary Perdue are doing very good work.
Now I would like to focus on the Trump administration’s unprecedented coronavirus response.  Some have erroneously suggested that the Trump administration threw out the pandemic response playbook left by the Obama-Biden administration.  What the critics fail to note, however, is that this thin packet of paper was replaced by two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.  So we exchanged this one, which I will hand over to my assistant, Lyndee, for these two pandemic response plans.
In 2018, the Trump administration issued our Pandemic Crisis Action Plan, one of the binders that I just handed to Lyndee.  Further, from August 13th to the 16th, the Trump administration conducted the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise.  This was a pandemic stimulation [simulation] to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak.
In January of 2020, HHS issued the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise After-Action Report.  That was one of the additional documents that I just handed over.  This exercise expounded upon — exposed, rather, the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response, beginning as early as January.  And those legacy planning document shortcomings were, in fact, the papers that I just handed over, that were provided to us by the Obama-Biden administration.
For example, President Trump’s Crimson After-Action Report highlighted that the Obama-era policy directive from November 2016, quote — and I’m quoting from the document — “Does not provide the requisite mechanisms or processes to effectively lead the coordination of the federal government’s response.”  Instead, President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force and put Vice President Pence in charge of the interagency response.  These were effective decisions, and they undoubtedly enhanced our response to the coronavirus.
Furthermore, what Crimson Contagion taught us is that President Trump was right all along about misguided economic and trade policies that left Americans vulnerable to pandemics.
In June 2016 — so, many, many years ago — then-businessman Donald Trump said this: quote, “America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer…I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.  Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.  This is not some natural disaster.  It is politician-made disaster.”  That was then-candidate Trump, who has now implemented those policies as President Trump.
And this forward-thinking vision contrasted with that of President Obama who said, quote, “Trump just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’  Well, what — how exactly are you going to negotiate that?  What magic wand do you have?”  That magic wand was ripping up Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It was ripping up NAFTA.  It was replacing it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a great deal for automakers and our farmers.  And it was ending China’s predatory trade policies and negotiating a historic phase one China deal.  That is what this President has done.
Yesterday, President Trump went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and visited Owens & Minor, Inc.  This was a clear example of domestic manufacturing at work.  You saw this administration taking action to restructure and secure our stockpile of medical supplies.  President Trump released a plan to restructure the Strategic National Stockpile yesterday, and he signed an executive order providing the authority to ensure America is producing critical goods necessary to build up our strategic stockpiles.
The President’s trip was an example of what he’s been saying all along: that America must manufacture, that America must produce, here, in our interior.
Additionally, the President launched Project Air Bridge to bring supplies from all over the world to support America’s frontline healthcare workers.  The administration partnered with the private sector to secure donations and production of PPE and other medical supplies.  And President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act, otherwise known as the DPA, to mobilize our country to manufacture and secure massive amounts of PPE and ventilators.
Through Project Air Bridge, to date, more than 1.4 million N95 respirators have been delivered, as well as 90- — 921 million gloves, 17.1 million surgical gowns, and more.
The Trump playbook and the whole-of-America response to this pandemic has far exceeded what this administration inherited.
And finally, President Trump took action before the pandemic to anticipate and game-plan such scenarios.  President Trump streamlined the National Security Council in 2018 by creating a counter-proliferation and bio-defense directorate.  This directorate combined NSC experts focused on biological threats under a single and more senior leader, and did away with a confusing organizational chart that required some experts to report to two bosses simultaneously.
In short, the NSC retained the same number of experts focused on biological threats that the Obama administration had, but honed them in and focused them more and house them in a more coherent structure and with a more senior leader.
I’d also note that this directorate, which exists today, is the same office that critics allege, to this day, that President Trump eliminated.  I hope in your reporting you are now able to debunk this claim.
Recognizing the seriousness of biological threats, President Trump released a series of strategic documents to transform our preparedness for biological incidents, including pandemics.  In September of 2018, President Trump released the National Biodefense Strategy.  In May of 2019, he released the Global Health Security Strategy.  And in September of 2019, he signed an EO to modernize influenza vaccines.
His leadership is evident in the early days of this pandemic and in the preparation before that.  And these actions I’ve outlined today, these plans I noted, helped us as we approached what was an unprecedented crisis.  It helped us to deploy our resources and to deliver what I believe is the one of the best responses we’ve seen in this country’s history.
And, with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-051520/

2:40 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  Sorry we’re a little late today.  As you know, the President had two events this morning, so we didn’t want our unprecedented transparency to get in the way of lunch, so we’re glad that you all had a few moments there to eat.  So our delay was hopefully useful and helpful to you guys.
I have an announcement on the Trump administration’s unwavering support for our farmers.  Today, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and senior advisor Ivanka Trump announced the launch of the Farmers to Families Food Box program.  This is a $3 billion program to support farmers and provide food to our most vulnerable communities.  Senior advisor Ivanka Trump and Secretary Perdue are doing very good work.
Now I would like to focus on the Trump administration’s unprecedented coronavirus response.  Some have erroneously suggested that the Trump administration threw out the pandemic response playbook left by the Obama-Biden administration.  What the critics fail to note, however, is that this thin packet of paper was replaced by two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.  So we exchanged this one, which I will hand over to my assistant, Lyndee, for these two pandemic response plans.
In 2018, the Trump administration issued our Pandemic Crisis Action Plan, one of the binders that I just handed to Lyndee.  Further, from August 13th to the 16th, the Trump administration conducted the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise.  This was a pandemic stimulation [simulation] to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak.
In January of 2020, HHS issued the Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise After-Action Report.  That was one of the additional documents that I just handed over.  This exercise expounded upon — exposed, rather, the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response, beginning as early as January.  And those legacy planning document shortcomings were, in fact, the papers that I just handed over, that were provided to us by the Obama-Biden administration.
For example, President Trump’s Crimson After-Action Report highlighted that the Obama-era policy directive from November 2016, quote — and I’m quoting from the document — “Does not provide the requisite mechanisms or processes to effectively lead the coordination of the federal government’s response.”  Instead, President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force and put Vice President Pence in charge of the interagency response.  These were effective decisions, and they undoubtedly enhanced our response to the coronavirus.
Furthermore, what Crimson Contagion taught us is that President Trump was right all along about misguided economic and trade policies that left Americans vulnerable to pandemics.
In June 2016 — so, many, many years ago — then-businessman Donald Trump said this: quote, “America became the world’s dominant economy by becoming the world’s dominant producer…I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.  Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.  This is not some natural disaster.  It is politician-made disaster.”  That was then-candidate Trump, who has now implemented those policies as President Trump.
And this forward-thinking vision contrasted with that of President Obama who said, quote, “Trump just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’  Well, what — how exactly are you going to negotiate that?  What magic wand do you have?”  That magic wand was ripping up Trans-Pacific Partnership.  It was ripping up NAFTA.  It was replacing it with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a great deal for automakers and our farmers.  And it was ending China’s predatory trade policies and negotiating a historic phase one China deal.  That is what this President has done.
Yesterday, President Trump went to Allentown, Pennsylvania, and visited Owens & Minor, Inc.  This was a clear example of domestic manufacturing at work.  You saw this administration taking action to restructure and secure our stockpile of medical supplies.  President Trump released a plan to restructure the Strategic National Stockpile yesterday, and he signed an executive order providing the authority to ensure America is producing critical goods necessary to build up our strategic stockpiles.
The President’s trip was an example of what he’s been saying all along: that America must manufacture, that America must produce, here, in our interior.
Additionally, the President launched Project Air Bridge to bring supplies from all over the world to support America’s frontline healthcare workers.  The administration partnered with the private sector to secure donations and production of PPE and other medical supplies.  And President Trump effectively leveraged the Defense Production Act, otherwise known as the DPA, to mobilize our country to manufacture and secure massive amounts of PPE and ventilators.
Through Project Air Bridge, to date, more than 1.4 million N95 respirators have been delivered, as well as 90- — 921 million gloves, 17.1 million surgical gowns, and more.
The Trump playbook and the whole-of-America response to this pandemic has far exceeded what this administration inherited.
And finally, President Trump took action before the pandemic to anticipate and game-plan such scenarios.  President Trump streamlined the National Security Council in 2018 by creating a counter-proliferation and bio-defense directorate.  This directorate combined NSC experts focused on biological threats under a single and more senior leader, and did away with a confusing organizational chart that required some experts to report to two bosses simultaneously.
In short, the NSC retained the same number of experts focused on biological threats that the Obama administration had, but honed them in and focused them more and house them in a more coherent structure and with a more senior leader.
I’d also note that this directorate, which exists today, is the same office that critics allege, to this day, that President Trump eliminated.  I hope in your reporting you are now able to debunk this claim.
Recognizing the seriousness of biological threats, President Trump released a series of strategic documents to transform our preparedness for biological incidents, including pandemics.  In September of 2018, President Trump released the National Biodefense Strategy.  In May of 2019, he released the Global Health Security Strategy.  And in September of 2019, he signed an EO to modernize influenza vaccines.

2:17 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Hello, everyone.  I want to highlight three critical aspects of President Trump’s response to the coronavirus that have exceeded the media’s expectations and should inspire confidence in every American across this country.  Rest assured the Trump administration is working tirelessly to defeat the invisible enemy.
First, contrary to some media pronouncements, the United States did not need the 1 million ventilators thus far that the media said we were in dire need of.  In fact, it’s encouraging to be able to say that every single American who has needed a ventilator has received a ventilator.  And this administration has managed to pe- — procure, excuse me, 100,000 ventilators to be manufactured in 100 days.  That’s extraordinary.  That’s three times the amount produced in the average year.
Likewise, there was some concern about N95 respirators, but the Trump administration has now shipped over 90 million N95 respirators.  Once again, that is more than three times the average healthcare industry consumption of N95 restorators [sic] — respirators in the typical year.
Finally, the U.S. now leads the world in testing.  For weeks, the media cited South Korea as being the gold standard for testing.  But as it stands, we are now testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea.  And, in fact, as this chart is going to show you, in all 50 states we are now testing at a higher rate per capita than South Korea.  So a state in this country is testing at a higher rate per capita than the entire country of South Korea.  That’s pretty extraordinary, I would say.
Now I would like to provide the American people with an update on the Trump administration’s support for underserved communities.  As the President has said, this country is at war with the invisible enemy.  And while we all fight the virus as one united American people, it is a fact that this virus disproportionately has affected those in medically underserved communities, and therefore the President has committed to delivering economic support and quality care for individuals in distressed communities.
The Trump administration, as I announced last week, distributed $12 billion in provider relief payments to 395 hospitals across the country that have been harded [sic] — hardest hit by the coronavirus.  Many of these hospitals were in underserved communities.  And to ensure even more funding to these communities, $2 billion of that overall funding was specifically targeted to hospitals in proportion to the amount of care they provide for low-income and uninsured patients.
Additionally, the Trump administration is investing nearly $2 billion in community health centers to help their 28 million patients in medically underserved areas that receive care and the testing they need.  That’s what this funding is intended for.  And additionally, there’s $583 million awarded to 1,385 health centers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the eight U.S. territories specifically geared towards testing.
These health centers currently provide 100,000 tests per week, and 59 percent of the patients tested last week were from minority communities.
Finally, under the Paycheck Protection Program, the Trump administration has done extensive outreach to the community development financial institution funds across the country.  These are known as CDFIs, and they support revitalization in distressed communities.  In the second round of PPP, 100,000 loans have been distributed to CDFIs and to MDIs, which are known as minority deposit institutions.  These have amounted to about $6.2 billion.
And finally, 570,723 loans have been issued to smaller lenders and non-banks, and these loans have amounted to $29.9 billion.  President Trump will continue to fight for the health, safety, and economic wellbeing of all Americans, especially those impacted in low-income communities and disadvantaged communities.
And with that, I’ll take questions.
Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-051220/

4:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  We’re here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States — the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far.  This afternoon, I’ll also announce new steps that we’re taking to make tests even more widely available.
To battle a virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our nation’s disposal: public, private, military, economic, scientific, and industrial — all at your disposal.  We launched the largest manufacturing ramp-up since the Second World War.  There’s been nothing like it since.
At the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities.  In the span of just a few short months, we’ve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close.  This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America.  And we’re opening, and we’re starting, and there’s enthusiasm like I haven’t seen in a long time.
Every American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill, and enterprise our nation has brought to this challenge.  In three months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States.  Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day.  Now we’re doing approximately 300,000 tests per day — a 100 percent increase — and it will go up substantially from that number.
This week, the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted — nearly double the number of any other country.  We’re testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries — and, in some cases, combined.
On Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen tests, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured.  Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point-of-care test, estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks.
To further expand our nation’s testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration is — and that we’ve got this all approved; it’s all done — is sending $1 billion to America’s states, territories, and tribes.  So this has all been approved.  We’ve gotten it done, completed.  The money is going out.  This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far.
I said from the beginning that the federal government would back up the states and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that’s exactly what’s happened.  This partnership has truly flourished.  We have really had a very good relationship with the states and the governors and other representatives within the states — a relationship like, I think I can honestly say, has not been seen in this country for many, many years.
The governors and us are working together very closely not only on testing, but on ventilators, where we have a capacity that’s, at this point, virtually unlimited.  And we’re sending ventilators — as you probably heard from other countries, we’re sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they’re in tremendous need.  And I think building up a lot of goodwill, but much more importantly than that, we’re saving a lot of lives.
Most states are now doing a great job.  My administration located 5,000 machines in 700 labs across all 50 states, and governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources.
The federal government is also supporting states with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one-on-one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly.
In recent weeks, we’ve held multiple conference calls with every state, as well as with D.C. and Puerto Rico.  We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each state for the month of May, altogether totaling 12.9 million tests.  Think of that: 12.9 million tests.
Today, I’m announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help states meet their targets and meet them rapidly.
During the month of May, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swabs to states nationwide.  We already have them; the delivery will be very quick.  We’re prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any state is on a pace to surpass its goal.  And their goals are very high.  We’ve set them very high, and we’ve told them to set them very high.
My administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing.  A complicated process, but we’ve made it simple.  As a result of these actions, every single state will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in four months since the outbreak began.
This major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher.  Some of these incredible companies produced and produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon.  These are all different products that were literally just developed, and — if you can imagine that.  And these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world.  And other countries are calling us, and we’re trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing.
My administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities.  Through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that’s in addition to all of the other sites that we have working.  Seventy percent of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities.
There will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days.  These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community.  My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy.
In addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90 million N95 masks, and these are of the highest quality — many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn’t have at all at the beginning — 126 million surgical masks — likewise, many are made here; 9 million face shields; 21 million surgical gowns; 993 million gloves; and 10,690 ventilators.  We’re building thousands of ventilators in numerous plants all across our country.  It’s incredible, actually.
This global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people.  It should have never been allowed to happen.  It should have been stopped at the source.  We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one — and that goes worldwide, too.  Many, many countries — 184 countries, at least.
Thanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved.  And we have saved — and if you look at on a per-100,000 basis, we’re at the best part of the pack, right on the bottom.  Germany and us are leading the world.  Germany and the United States are leading the world — lives saved per hundred thousand.
In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task.  We have met the moment, and we have prevailed.  Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.
Day after day, we’re making tremendous strides.  With the dedication of our doctors and nurses — these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors — with the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy, and we will transition into greatness.  That’s a phrase you’re going to hear a lot because that’s what’s going to happen.
We’re going into the third quarter, and we’re going to do well.  In the fourth quarter, we’re going to do very good.  And next year, I think we’re going to have one of the best years we’ve ever had because there’s a tremendous pent-up demand.  It’s a demand — and I’m feeling it.  I’ve felt things a lot over my life, and I’ve made a lot of good calls.  It’s a demand like I don’t think I’ve ever seen.  There’s a pent-up demand.  There’s a — there’s a spirit of this country like few have seen.  And I think you can say — and we’ve helped a lot of the countries a lot.  Really, a lot.  There’s a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing.
But we’re transitioning to greatness, and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter, but it’s really going to be next year, and it’s going to be a year like we’ve never had before.  I really believe that.  As good as we’ve done — and we’ve done great; we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world.  You can talk China, you can talk any other country, we had the best economy anywhere in the world.
And we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers; employment, also, numbers — a little different — where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people.  All of that — we had the greatest stock market numbers ever.  I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time.  A hundred and fifty-two days we set records in the stock market.  We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States.  All of our equipment built — $1.5 trillion plus.
On the southern border, the wall is being built.  It’s being built rapidly.  And now you don’t hear the opponents talking too much about the border.  They don’t like to talk about it because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things.  One of the things we were right about — one of the many things was the border.  We have a very powerful border.  Now, we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border, between the United States and Mexico — our southern border.  We have very few people coming in — very, very few.  Almost record low numbers.
And the wall is being built.  It’s up to 181 miles already.  It’s being built.  It’s being built rapidly.  People don’t talk about it anymore because it’s very successful.  In the area where the wall has built — that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by a very short period of time.  Early next year, we should be up to 450.  And very shortly after that, over 500 miles to be completed.
But it’s had a tremendous impact.  But again, we’ve had the best numbers.  The last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our southern border.  And again, we’re doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers.
So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir — if you could, please come up — and Brad, if you would — Brad Smith.  And they’re going to do a little explaining as to what we’ve done with regard to testing and how successful it’s been.  And then we’ll take some questions after that.
Thank you very much.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration.  And thank you, Secretary Azar, for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I the opportunity to work on this project.
I think it’s clear that America does lead the world in testing.  I’ll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively.  I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem to keep America safe.  And clearly, as we’ve said multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality.
So let’s start potentially with the next slide.
This may be hard to see, but if you look at the line on top, that’s the total numbers of tests done by the United States.  No other country in the world comes close to the total numbers.  Again, as the President has said, today we will top over 9 million tests.  And if you look at per capita — everyone talks about South Korea being the standard — today, we will have done more than twice the per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in South Korea.  No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing.
And how did we get there?  Let’s look at the next slide.  Next slide please.
A very important component of how we came to this point was the authorization by the FDA, under the leadership of our Secretary, of many different diagnostic tests, of diagnostic devices, and now of serology tests.
So you’ve heard a lot about the different testing and you see some of the machines up here.  Most of the diagnostic tests — all but one — rely on the amplification of the viral RNA, the viral genetic material.  And we’ve talked to you about the diversity of tests.  There are very high-throughput tests that are done at big reference labs like LabCorp and Quest.  But very importantly, there are also tests — and you heard us talk about Cepheid, delivering over 2 million tests vitally important to rural America’s — and to places that do not have very large infrastructure.
You’ve also seen the Abbott tests we’ve talked about — there it is on the left of the President — delivering about 1.4 million tests as a point-of-care test.  You get the result within 5 to 15 minutes.  And we have deployed over 235,000 of these tests to the state public health laboratories in every state of this country to make sure that that point-of-care testing capability is there to research outbreaks, like in nursing homes or in certain industrial capacities, and well over 90,000 to the Indian Health Service, so they could test at a point of care in remote locations.
The President also talked about a new first-in-class test; it’s listed there as an antigen-based test.  This is very important — and you’ve heard Ambassador Birx talk about this multiple times — because antigen testing, although complex, is much less complex than the nucleic acid testing that we’ve had.
Quidel had this authorized by the FDA.  And as the President said, we’ll soon be making over 300,000 tests per day.  Do the math.  That’s 9 million point-of-care tests that we will have every month in just a few weeks.  It will clearly add to and, to a certain degree, transform our landscape.
What you don’t see up here is the important work the FDA did.  I’m a swab guy now.  I’m very interested in swabs.  In order to make all these tests work, you have to show that a certain swab, made of a certain material, performed in a certain way, delivers a highly accurate result.
And what you’re seeing up here is some of the fruits of that labor.  Without the authorizations of, for example, the foam nasal swab, we would be blowing through PPE all across the country because of the need for full PPE just to take a test.  That has really been changed by this diverse authorization and a recent authorization that allows the great manufacturer, U.S. Cotton, to join our foundational industry of Puritan.
Next slide.
Last week, we did over 1.9 million tests, and that number is growing.  And again, as the President said and Brad will talk about, our states aspire to do well over 12 million tests over the next four weeks.
You see the graph growing.  What you also see very importantly is that little orange bar on the bottom is the cumulative number of positives.  Our percent positives are going down, and that’s what we want to see.  In fact, in 31 states as of last night, the positivity rate is less than 10 percent, which is not a litmus test, but is a good idea that we’re doing plenty enough testing that we can enter phase one for careful reopening.
I also want to take the opportunity to say this doesn’t happen by accident.  I’m seeing everyone in the audience here, and I’m so pleased that they can be here.  People sitting in the front have been working, literally, 18 to 20 hours a day, every single day of the week, for at least the past two months.  None of this happens by accident.  It happens because their hard work, their sacrifice, their sacrifice to their family all for a common good.  And I’m very, very honored to consider you all as my colleagues.
And my last slide, as the President said, $11 billion are now being announced to be delivered to the states for the sole support of testing.  This will give them the resources to partner, as they have, with the federal government, with the President, the Vice President, the task force, with Brad and I, to achieve their testing goals.  And we’re going to be very specific, and they know it, that there needs to be minimum numbers to be planned to test.  They have to have plans for their vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, including those who are disabled, including those who are in prisons or who have working environments that they may have a more likelihood to spread the infection.
And combined with that, the Secretary’s Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of state, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked to the services that they need — not only testing, but in care as well.
And with that, I’d like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who’s the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together.
Brad.
MR. SMITH:  Thank you, Admiral.  I want to talk through a little bit, specifically the work that we’ve been doing with the states.
So, as the Admiral mentioned, over the past few weeks, we’ve been working with each state to set a target for their testing goal for May.  With — over the series of a couple of different calls, we’ve aligned on what those goals are.  And as the Admiral mentioned and the President mentioned, they add up to over 12.9 million tests in the month of May.
For every state, this is greater than 2 percent of their population in the entire state being tested in May, and for many states, it’s a much higher number than that.  When you compare this, as the President mentioned, to South Korea, South Korea is actually below that 2 percent not for a month, but for their total tests to date since the start of the year.  And so our states have come together to set really ambitious goals that we’re excited to support them in meeting.
If you go to the next slide.  As I talked about last time in the press briefing, there are really three parts to making sure that tests can happen.  The first part is the specimen collection supplies, the second part is the machines, and the third part are the lab supplies that the machines need to run. And what we’ve been working to do is to make sure that each state has all three of those parts to be able to conduct the number of tests.
The first part is the specimen-collection supplies.  The commercial market today is providing a large number of these supplies already to states and already to hospitals, but we wanted to ensure that every state had more than what they needed to be able to conduct the number of tests they’re aiming in May.  So what we’ve done is we’ve purchased enough tests to support the state testing goals for May and June.  So we will be sending more than 12.9 million swabs and over 10 million media to the states over the course of May, and a similar or greater number over the course of June.
In addition, we have several million in reserve.  So if states are able to exceed their goal in third and fourth week of May, we can provide them even more swabs and transport media.  And again, this is in addition to what’s already available on the commercial market.
If you go to the next slide.  There are large numbers that have been talked about many times — a large number of testing machines across the country, over 5,000 different machines that can conduct these tests.  The key part is making sure that the machines and that the labs have enough supplies to run the machines.  There will be, in the month of May, commercially produced, over 25 million test kits, which is either the PCR and extraction kits or the cartridges, to be able to support tests in their effort — states in their testing effort.
And what we’ve been working to do with each state is understand their total goal.  And each of the manufacturers has been a great partner with us and told us how many tests they’re shipping to each lab in each state over the course of May.  And what we know is that, in the aggregate, the number of test kits the state is getting is greater than their testing goal for the month of May.
In addition to what the states have already purchased, there’s over 7 million additional tests that remain unpurchased — the majority of those from Thermo Fisher, which is the most common machine in the country.  So we feel very confident that states will not only have the specimen-collection supplies and the machines, but also the extraction kits and the reagents they need to be able to hit or potentially exceed their testing goals.
And if you go to the last slide.  The last piece of the puzzle is making sure that Americans have access to these tests.  Healthcare providers, hospitals, primary care physicians are already providing these tests today.  And we, for the past six or seven weeks, have been partnering with the retailers who have massively been ramping up their effort.
Today there are over 240 retail sites.  We’ve been working with the retailers to make sure that they’re specifically targeting low-income and other vulnerable communities across the country, and we are talking with them about potentially opening more than another thousand additional sites over the next month or two.
So we hope that we’ve put together the right pieces of the puzzle: having access points for patients and Americans across the country, having the specimen-collection supplies needed to take the test, having the machines, and then also having the lab testing supplies with the machines.
So, thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Brad.  And maybe you’ll both stay there.  Could be some questions.
Okay.  Please, John.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-covid-19-testing/

12:38 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon.  Today marks the 75th anniversary of VE Day, a triumphant milestone in our nation’s history and indeed in world history.  Seventy-five years ago today, our brave American forces defeated fascism in Europe.  And through the selfless devotion of thousands of patriots, they saved the world.
Over 180,000 Americans gave their lives in the European theater during World War Two.  And I want to take just a moment to honor their service and their sacrifice.  Thank you to all of our veterans.  You are truly, truly our heroes.
Now, as I move to my next subject, I want to begin by saying this: Look, our rank-and-file men and women at the FBI are heroes in their own right.  They protect this country from domestic crime, and we thank them for their service.  They work hard.  And once again, we owe them a debt of gratitude.  But that is separate and apart from what I’m about to address right now.
The FBI exists to investigate crimes.  But in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, it appears that they might have existed to manufacture one.  As the motion filed by the Department of Justice yesterday explained, the FBI set out to interview General Michael Flynn, when they had no predigate [sic] — predicate for any investigation of any crime.
Over the past week, we learned, from a handwritten note, the true intent behind the FBI’s investigation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.  The very day that then-FBI Director Jim Comey sent agents to the White House to interview Flynn, the FBI discussed what their intent was beforehand.  This is what they said: “What is our goal?  Truth, admission?  Or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?”  These notes, in addition to other evidence, raise serious questions about the handling of the — of the FBI’s handling of Michael Flynn’s case.
Did the FBI confront Flynn with the intent to get him to lie so that we can prosecute him and fire him?  Did the FBI manufacture a crime against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn?
Federal investigators appear to paint a target on the back of General Michael Flynn.  Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal laid out, point by point, the very concerning aspects of this case, and I’m going to reiterate them as outlined in her column over the weekend:
In December 2016, Flynn spoke as the incoming national security advisor to the Russian ambassador.  This call, as is customary, was recorded by the United States government.  They record calls with foreigners.  But in a highly irregular move, the intelligence community, under the Obama administration, unmasked the identity of Michael Flynn, a United States citizen, who is entitled to Fourth Amendment rights and to due process.  But Lieutenant General Michael Flynn received none of that.
The intelligence community was hunting for evidence against General Flynn — evidence they did not find.  We learned from newly released transcripts that in stark contrast to what former DNI James Clapper had been saying publicly, and contrary to what he was saying publicly, here’s what he was saying privately with regard to Russian collusion: “I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting [or] conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.”  Sounds awfully different from what he just said 10 days prior in a public capacity.
Having found no evidence of Russian collusion, the FBI came up with a new absurd theory that Flynn might have violated the Logan Act, a statute from 1799 that, in its 200 years of existence, had never been used to convict an American citizen, but it was resurrected in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.
Michael Flynn didn’t violate the Logan Act.  Even the FBI did not think that General Flynn’s telephone call provided the predicate for a criminal investigation.  In fact, in January of 2017, an internal FBI document concluded that Flynn was, quote, “no longer a valid viable candidate for investigation.”  Disgraced FBI agent and noted Trump hater, Peter Strzok, disagreed, texting this: “Hey, if you haven’t closed that Flynn case yet, don’t do so yet.” End quote.  So the Flynn case remained active.  This was a good thing for Peter Strzok, but it was a bad thing for justice.  It was a bad thing for the rule of law.
According to yesterday’s motion to dismiss the case against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, it said this: Mr. Strzok immediately relayed the, quote, “serendipitously good” news to Lisa Page, special counsel at the FBI, remarking, quote, “our utter incompetence actually helps us.”  That’s right.  Their utter incompetence to close the case against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was something to be serendipitously celebrated.
The scheme to manufacture a case against Michael Flynn continued.  After President Trump entered office, the FBI’s partisan pursuit of General Flynn proceeded under Jim Comey’s FBI.  Despite possessing a transcript of Flynn’s entire conversation, the FBI decided it was somehow necessary to go ask General Flynn what happened on the call, despite having a transcript in their possession.  The only motive would have been to, quote, “get him to lie.”
They advised him he didn’t need a lawyer present.  Imagine that: “You’re an American citizen.  You don’t need a lawyer.  We’re just coming in to have a chat.”  They didn’t inform their superiors at the Department of Justice about their intent to interview Flynn, despite their own attorney at the FBI saying, “If we usually tell the White House, then I think we need to do what we normally do.”  But they ignored the advice of FBI counsel, and they went in to interrogate Michael Flynn.
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, no fan of President Trump, said she was “flabbergasted.”  She was “dumbfounded” by the decision to not inform DOJ officials who, quote, “hit the roof.”  This is all outlined in a legal document that you can find.
Additionally, when the FBI arrived at the White House, they did not even warn lawyer-less Flynn about the consequences for providing an inaccurate response.  The interrogation of Michael Flynn was not an inquiry.  Make no mistake: It was a trap.  Even more troubling was the fact that after the interrogation of Flynn, former Deputy Director of the FBI Andy McCabe concluded that he, quote, “didn’t think Flynn was lying.”  But the case against Flynn continued.
We were pleased to learn yesterday that the Justice Department moved to drop the case against General Michael Flynn.  Though it took several years, it is encouraging to see that justice finally prevailed.  As we move forward as a country, it’s important to take these revelations very seriously in order for Americans to have faith in our justice system.
If the top leadership of the FBI can target a three-star general who served this country for three decades, make no mistake, they can target you.  It’s hard to believe that this happened in the United States of America.
General Michael Flynn’s life was forever changed.  He had to sell his home.  He faced financial ruin.  His family was even threatened with prosecution.  But despite all of that, here’s what Michael Flynn put out yesterday in his first reaction to the motion to dismiss.  If we can play the video, let’s go ahead and play it.
I don’t think we have the video queued, but I encourage you all to go on General Twynn’s [sic] — Flynn’s Twitter feed, and what you’ll see is a really beautiful video of his grandson talking about how much he loves this country and how everyone deserves justice for all.  And how commendable that is for General Flynn, at a time when he was so gravely wronged to say this: I still believe in this country.  I still believe in America.  I still believe in the principles that make this country the greatest on Earth.
And in the words of renowned political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu, “There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and in the name of justice.”
I hope the media will take these questions very seriously, will report the facts.  There was heavy interest in the first iteration of Flynn news from many years ago that got four times the coverage that the exoneration of Michael Flynn got today.  That was a report by Media Research Center.  So these facts are important, and thank you very much for those who have taken interest in reporting.
And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-050820/

4:32 P.M. EDT

MS. MCENANY:  Good afternoon, everyone.  I’d like to direct your attention to a very encouraging graph regarding test results.  It’ll be over my shoulder and hopefully on the screen for those of you watching on television.  As this chart shows, the United States has, to date, completed 7.5 million coronavirus tests.  It’s an extraordinary number.  And, as you can see, the United States leads the world in testing. 

This graph is no accident.  In fact, this graph is a testament to American innovation, including the work of the Trump administration.  For example, the FDA has issued over 70 emergency use authorizations to expand testing capacity to accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  There are nearly 80 clinical trials ongoing with an additional 30 clinical trials expected. 

This graph is also a testament to the American people who have been — and it’s no exaggeration — American warriors, as they’ve followed social distancing guidelines and taken steps to ensure that the health and safety of our vulnerable populations is protected. 

Finally, I would like to note that this graph indicates that the U.S. has conducted double the number of tests conducted in other countries.  The U.S. is providing leadership during this crisis, not only leading the world in testing, but also taking steps to help allies around the world — steps we are able to take only because of this country’s incredible ingenuity and work ethic. 

As you’re well aware, President Trump has consistently sided with the experts and has always prioritized the health and safety of the American people.  This includes issuing guidance that meant hardworking Americans had to stay home, social distance, and slow the spread of the virus.  The hard work of Americans saved many lives, and we salute the great citizens of this country for your hard work. 

As Americans across the country stayed home and businesses temporarily shut their doors, President Trump ensured American employees and employers would receive the help that they needed.  The Paycheck Protection Program provided forgivable loans to small-business owners who kept their employees on payroll. 

To date, 2.3 million small-business loans have been processed, with the average loan being $76,000.  In other words, meaning that the small businesses that needed the help the most got it.  I would remind everyone that, of the 1.6 million loans given out in the first tranche of spending, one million of those went to businesses with 10 or fewer employees.  So it truly has gone to those who need it most. 

Joe Shamess is a small-business owner.  Joe, with his co-founder Brian Steorts are two veteran special operators in the military who started Flags of Valor in 2015.  It’s a veteran-owned, veteran-run manufacturing company located not too far from here in Virginia. 

Flags of Valor builds wooden flags, among other products.  They’ve employed, over their years, 65 veterans and have raised over $1 million for veteran charities.  Flags of Valor is also proud to have 97,000 hours of American manufacturing labor under their belt.  That’s a lot of hours. 

At the start of this crisis, Joe had to furlough four of his employees, in addition to imposing a 50 percent pay cut.  His employees were, of course, disappointed but they were, quote, in his words, “all in,” in the fight against the coronavirus. 

Everything changed for Joe and his furloughed employees when he applied for the PPP loan.  Just this week, he was approved for that PPP loan that enabled Flags of Valor to rehire its furloughed employees and to boost paychecks back to pre-coronavirus levels.  “PPP was a huge lifeline for us,” Joe told me.  He called it a lifesaver. 

This is a perfect example of why President Trump fought for additional PPP funding and will continue to fight for small businesses and American heroes like Joe.  Joe is here with me today, and I’d like to invite him to come up. 

Joe, thank you so much for your service.  Thank you for all the great work you’ve done for our veterans and being a veteran yourself.  I wanted to see if you’d take to the podium for a minute or two and share your message of hope with the American people. 

MR. SHAMESS:  I’d love to.  Thank you, Kayleigh, and thank you, President Trump, for allowing me to be here today.  I’ve got a couple props.  This is examples of one of our products that we make, and here’s another one.  This one, my son Gabriel made. 

And when — when you talk about hope and what’s going on, it’s a — it’s a challenging time for small business.  We lost two-thirds of our revenue like that.  Gone.  And so trying to get that back, and when you think about a small business that generally is running maybe it’s 10 to 20 percent profit margin, two-thirds is a killer. 

And so when you think about the Paycheck Protection Program, the two biggest fixed costs for most businesses is people and property.  And that’s exactly what the PPP focused on. 

So, for us, it was a lifesaver.  It was an absolute game changer.  We went from trying to figure out how we were going to limit our cash burn every single day to stay alive as long as we could, with as many people as we could, to finally bring them back.  And when you have to furlough someone, I’m telling you, it is one of the worst things you can do because you’re talking about family.  These are people.  These are their — their wives, their husbands, their children.  They’re a part of your ethos. 

And so what we’ve experienced has been challenging, sure.  But when there hasn’t been all the revenue, there’s been people helping other people.  And the way we approached it was, how can we be better?  How can we exit COVID-19 a better version of ourselves?  How can we innovate? 

And so we saw people like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the SBA step in.  We saw our partners at Under Armour step in.  We saw innovation — you see companies making respirator masks.  You see all kinds of stuff going on.  And we created the flag boat kit because families were at home with their kids.  They didn’t know what to do with their children.  And we believe this is our nation’s family crest.  So, what better thing than allow families to build American flags together and talk about that and what it means? 

And then we started a twice-a-day, daily pledge at 9:00 a.m. in the morning on the East Coast and again at 9:00 a.m. on the West Coast.  Every day we’ve got thousands of kids and their families joining us to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  It’s phenomenal.  And all that’s happening by people coming together, by people thinking and innovating. 

And — and I can’t tell you enough how grateful we are to the U.S. government, the bipartisanship that took place to pass the Paycheck Protection Program.  It was all hands on deck.  It wasn’t like — there was no script for this.  And they built the parachute on the way down. 

And when you think about it, you want to talk about the Lakers got it or somebody else got it — think about the millions of businesses that are being benefitted by this.  And it’s, I think, 47 percent of U.S. private-sector employees are in small businesses.  They work for small businesses. 

And so, all the big businesses we love, they started as small businesses.  And I hope to be a big business someday, but for now, I’m happy to be alive.  I’m thankful for your support.  And thank you, Kayleigh, for letting me be here. 

So, join us at FlagsofValor.com.  Thank you. 

MS. MCENANY:  Joe, if you want to take a seat with the reporters, you can ask me some questions. 

MR. SHAMESS:  I’m happy right here.

MS. MCENANY:  Joe, it’s veterans like you that make our country great.  It’s small-business owners like you that are going to bring this country back.  And employees like the one we heard from last week — Michael Heup, the employee of Bitty & Beau’s Coffee — that keep this country going.  So thank you so much for the example you’ve set and to the hardworking business owners across the country, to the employees across this country who are working during this time.  So, thank you, Joe.  Thank you for your service.

As I said, PPP has changed lives across this country.  And as President Trump has said, the American people are warriors and we will fight together to defeat the invisible enemy.

And with that, I’ll take questions.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-050620/

2:11 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY:  So, good afternoon.  I have an announcement for you on hospital funding as appropriated in the third phase of coronavirus relief.
The Trump administration will distribute a total of $12 billion in Provider Relief Fund payments to 395 hospitals across the country that have been hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These hospitals have collectively cared for over 70 percent of the 184,000 Americans that required hospital inpatient care.  Ten billion of the twelve billion will go towards hospitals treating 100 or more COVID-19 admissions.  HHS is distributing an additional $2 billion to these 395 hospitals in proportion to the amount of care they provide to low-income and uninsured patients.
This is consistent with our effort to ensure that Americans who need federal government assistance the most receive it.  We’ll be releasing a breakdown of the states receiving this funding and the counties receiving this funding.  But for your awareness, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois received the most funding by states, while New York, New York; Bronx, New York; and Cook, Illinois received the most funding by county as determined by our metrics.
Our healthcare providers, as President Trump has repeatedly acknowledged, are our heroes as we work to defeat the invisible enemy.  This relief funding will help these heroes defeat this virus.  In reacting to CARES relief, I love what this one provider said.  So he said, “Thank you and God” — “Thank you and God for this relief.  I have tears in my eyes out of gratitude for these funds.  Thank you so, so, so much.”
Additionally, 100 flights as part of Project Airbridge have been completed to date.  These flights have expedited nearly 1 billion pieces of PPE for our healthcare heroes.
The third phase of coronavirus relief also included $320 billion in additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, which, as you all know, provides forgivable loans to small businesses in order to keep their employees on payroll.
This program has been extraordinarily successful during the first round of PPP loans: 1.6 million loans were issued to small businesses.  Of those 1.6 million loans, 1 million of them were given to companies with 10 or fewer employees.  So it has gone to small businesses and businesses that need it most.
But the PPP — look, it’s not just another government program.  This is supporting everyday Americans who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves in this predicament.  We saw this firsthand at the White House on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, President Trump welcomed small-business owners and employees to the White House.  These small businesses received PPP loans, which helped them pay their employees during the pandemic.
Bitty and Beau’s was among the small businesses welcomed to the White House.  Bitty and Beau’s employs 120 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  It’s a coffee shop not too far away from here.  Bitty and Beau’s had to temporarily close its doors, but because of PPP loans, Bitty and Beau’s was able to rehire all of its employees.
I had the real honor of getting to meet Michael Heup.  He’s one of the employees at Bitty and Beau’s, and he offered some words of encouragement to our country.  And they really touched my heart, and I think they’ll touch the heart of America, if you guys wouldn’t mind playing those remarks.
(A video is played.)
Michael is an incredible young man.  I gave him a call yesterday and asked him what he was up to, and he said he and his fellow employees were literally handwriting notes to put in with their coffee packages that they send out to consumers.  I received one of these notes from another company, and it really does put a smile on your face.  And Michael is doing that each and every day.
And Bitty and Beau’s, they represent the hope and opportunity that is on the horizon for America’s workers as their body, their — their business, rather, embodies the American spirit.  Workers, like Michael, show that this country is not broken and that we will recover together.
Michael, thank you.  You’re an American hero.  Thank you for sharing that message of hope.
And with that, I’ll take questions.  John.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany/

5:38 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today I’d like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus.  Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens — we’ve had such tremendous support all over — we continue to see encouraging signs of progress.
Cases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining.  Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St. Louis are all stable and declining.  All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better.  In all cases, getting better.  And we’re seeing very little that we’re going to look at as a superseding hotspot.  Things are moving along.  Really, a horrible situation that we’ve been confronted with, but they’re moving along.
As we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains, however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy.  We grieve by their side as one family — this great American family.  And we do grieve.
We also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus.  We’re doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually re-open our nation, and to safely get our people back to work.  They want to get back to work, and they want to get back to work soon.  There’s a hunger for getting our country back, and it’s happening, and it’s happening faster than people would think.
Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation.  These goals work in tandem.  They work side by side.
It’s clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives.  For those who are infected, we have taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world.  The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment, as you know — in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it; some of our greatest executives — some of the greatest anywhere in the world — and distributed over 10,000 ventilators.
And we now have, in a very short period of time — many have been delivered, and hundreds of thousands are being built.  And frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with.  They’re actually shipping them to different locations, and we’re shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world, because we have ventilators like — the job that they’ve done in getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible.  You don’t hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way.
We’ve launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise, on Earth.  The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests — nearly double the number tested in any other country.  More than twice as much as any other country.  Think of that.
Moments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger.  We’re joined by leaders of those great companies.  And we also have with us the leaders from the world’s top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers: Thermo Fisher, LabCorp, Quest, U.S. Cotton, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association.  These are great — great companies.
These private-sector leaders, along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic, and Cephe– Cepheid, have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the states’ capabilities and our country’s capabilities.  The job they’ve done has been incredible.  The testing that’s been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing.
I want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they’ve done.  I want to thank Roche.  And in particular, those two have really stepped forward.  Abbott with a five-minute test that people can take, and in five minutes they know what the — what the answer is.
I’d like to ask, if I could, the executives of these great companies — and they are — they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period.  We’re talking about a 45-day period when many of us met.  And since then, what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing.
So I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company.  Plus, they’re going to make a big contribution to our country.
Please.  Come forward, please.  Thank you.
MR. RUSCKOWSKI:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for — all of you for being here today.  And what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made.
The last time we were here was March 13th, and we’ve made tremendous progress.  And none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock, working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need.
As far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress.  We are currently, at Quest Diagnostics, testing about 50,000 tests per day.  We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number by the end of May.  We’ll have 100,000 tests per day — about 3 million tests — and these are the molecular tests that we do today.
We have also brought up serological testing.  We started that this past week, and by the end of May, we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month.  So you put those two numbers together, and it’s about 10 million tests by the end of May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics.
We’re doing that also in a quicker way.  Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue in the early days.  We’ve reduced that to one to two days.  Our turnaround time for people in beds — hospital beds — is less than 24 hours.  And we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA, delivering the quality that you all expect.  And convenience will improve, as well, with convenient solutions that we’ll be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer — the ability to have consumers choose a test online with a telehealth provider.
So with that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
MR. SCHECHTER:  Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today.  Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible.
Just 45 days ago, we said we could do several thousand tests a day.  We can now do 60,000 tests a day, and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.
In addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier.  We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test.  That test, right now, is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks, and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers.
At the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing, and we can currently do about 50,000 today, and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May.  And we’re going to be working with the retailers — our colleagues that are here today — to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country.
And lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development business, and we will continue to work with our colleagues in the pharmaceutical and the biotech — biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Please, go ahead.  Please.
MR. CASPER:  Mr. President, thank you and thank — and thank the administration for all of the collaboration to enable Thermo Fisher Scientific to be able to produce the test kits that companies like LabCorp and Quest and the public health labs around the world run.
We met our original commitments of producing 5 million kits a week, and we’re up to scaling that to double that in the coming weeks in terms of supporting testing around the world.
I’d like to thank my 75,000 colleagues around the world for their tireless effort to make that a reality and supporting all of — all of our customers to have the testing necessary to get America back to work.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
MR. NIMS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m John Nims with U.S. Cotton, and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits.  We have about 1,200 people in our company.  And in our Cleveland operation, they have pivoted from, as you’ve said, the Q-tip-style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits.
Our Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this, and I’m very — they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort.
So thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
MR. MERLO:  Mr. President, thank you.  I’m Larry Merlo with CVS Health.  And it was just over a month ago that we opened up our first drive-through test site.  And since that time, we have opened large-scale testing facilities across five states in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, and Michigan.
And these sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with real-time results.  We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week.  And this afternoon, we announced plans to expand that capacity even further.
Beginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to 1,000 CVS pharmacies.  We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing.  So again, you’ll see that coming online, you know, in May.
And we also recognize the fact that the virus is disproportionately affecting our minority communities.  So we’re working in partnership with organizations like the National Medical Association to bring testing and care into the traditionally underserved communities.
We’re also beginning to implement mobile capabilities with which to do that.  And as businesses are restarting their workforce, we’ll also be looking to assist them, you know, as they begin to come back to a normal operation.
And finally, as my other colleagues, I just want to thank my CVS colleagues.  They have done a phenomenal job in terms of helping people in many different ways all across communities in the country.  And they’re part of this army of healthcare professionals and, you know, front-store and, you know, first-line supervisors and workers that are doing terrific things to bring our country together.  And, for that, we owe them a huge amount of gratitude.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.
MR. ASHWORTH:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Appreciate the invitation to be here today.  And it was just 45 days ago when we were here.  I’m Richard Ashworth.  I oversee Walgreens in the U.S.  And I just want to start off — Larry, like you — thanking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers — you know, giving them essential daily needs; the prescriptions, obviously, that they need; and even COVID testing while we’re here.
We also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all states, including Puerto Rico.  We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now, in partnership with our lab partners, and we’re excited to be able to do that.
We’re really excited with the public-private partnership that we have here, because that’s what’s enabling us to do this, and we look forward to working with the additional states to get these sites up and running as fast as possible.
As a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing: I’m really proud to be part of this profession.  And not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them, across grocery — mass, independents.  You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for: to help patients, counseling them on their medicines, and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing.
You know, pharmacy is right here in it with everyone, together in the community, and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now; serology, whatever that might look like in the future; and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come.
So thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you very much.
MR. ASHWORTH:  Thank you.
MR. MCMULLEN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  We appreciate all you’re doing to get America back to work and doing it safely.
I represent Kroger, and my name is Rodney McMullen, and I am so proud of our nearly half a million associates that are doing everything, every day, to keep customers safe and our associates safe.
And one of the things that we were able to do is provide the basic practices we’re doing.  We call it “blueprint.”  And it’s the things that all of us can learn from on how to get America back working.
We also announced earlier today, continuing to accelerate our practice on testing.  We are actively engaged in six states.  Next — in the next couple of weeks, we’ll take that to 12 states, and the number of tests that we do continues to grow faster than that.
Together, we will win.  Together, we will solve this problem and move on.  America is always great.  Thank you again.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
MR. MCMILLON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My name is Doug McMillon.  I’m a Walmart associate.  And I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our stores, Sam’s Clubs, distribution centers, and in our e-commerce fulfillment centers.  They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can-do attitude and step up.  It’s much appreciated.
We started 45 days ago, as did everyone else, and we’ve been operating sites for a while now.  We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 states.  By the end of next week, we’ll be to 45, and by the end of the May — end of May, we’ll be at 100.
We also — a few weeks ago, Vice President Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia — a food distribution center.  He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated.
And the President and Vice President were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns, and the President asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns.  And we don’t normally buy those, so I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that.  But I’d like to thank our apparel team, and McKesson in particular, for partnering with us.  We’ve been able to, in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns.  And by the end of May, we’ll have an additional 6 million available to help.
So thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doug.  Great job.  Thank you.
MS. DONIGAN:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country.  I’m Heyward Donigan with Rite Aid.  And we are currently operating 40 percent of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight states.
And we had the — I had the opportunity, as I was driving up, to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates — whether it be security or pharmacy front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much.  It was really amazing to see.
And I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times.  It’s been quite amazing.  And we too are going to expand our testing, and we’re doing about 1,500 a day.
Thanks.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
So thank you all very much.  It’s incredible what we’ve done together over a short period of time.  I want to thank our Vice President for the task force and the work.  Every day, it gets better.
And we had a fantastic goal with the governors today, and I would say that they are as — as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country.  It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way.  And the whole world is suffering because of it — 184 countries at least.
But I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they’ve done.  They have been fantastic with us, working with us.  And, as you know, for several weeks, my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in states.  Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity.
Then, one week ago, we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their states.  Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket.
On Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number — bigger than any country anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time; a number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day.  So we much more than doubled it, and that will be doubling again very shortly.
We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening.  And the reopening process — we want to get our country open.  And the testing is not going to be a problem at all.  In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have.
Today we’re releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the states as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening.  Our blueprint describes how states should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks, and conduct contact tracing.  We have it all.
Other countries are calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it.  And we’re helping them.  We’re dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing, just like we did on the ventilators.
I directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need.  And the pharmacies — as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing.  And we have other testing locations that we’re going to be allowing also, but having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal.  We’re also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program.  So they’re going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid.  So it’s a big — that’s a big deal.
So we’re deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help states, cities — to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast.  There’s tremendous energy in our country right now.  There’s energy like people haven’t seen in a long time — a spirit that they have not seen.  And we’re doing very well — very well — considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others.
This is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time.  You can probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time.  You all know what happened in 1917.  That’s over 100 years ago.
With that, I’d like to introduce, if I might — Dr. Birx, if you could come up.  And then, Admiral, you’ll come up.  And between the two of you, you’ll explain the entire process and how much progress we’ve made and where we’re going.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  So the blueprint lays out the roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private sector and the public sector, bringing together state and local governments with the federal government to ensure that we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives.
If we can have the first slide.  The core elements of the testing plan include both three elements: robust diagnostic testing plans developed in partnerships with state — and I just really want to thank the governors and the health officials, both at the state and local levels who have been working with us day and night to work through these issues, and also all the laboratory directors in many of those states, as well as the American Society for Microbiology, who have been working with us to ensure that the plans were efficient and effective.
Within the robust diagnostic testing plans, it was really unlocking the full capacity of the state: increasing the number of testing planforms — we now have multiple tests for different platforms; increasing the ability to collect samples; increasing testing and laboratory supplies; and ensuring that we work together to make sure that every client receives the test that they need.
This is added with timely monitoring systems.  And what do I mean by that?  Systems where we bring together the ability to not only diagnose the symptomatic, but proactively and interactively work with individuals that we know are at higher risk.  We’ve worked with states to look at where the outbreaks have occurred when they’re not in the large metros, and we see that it occurs very often in places of close settings, among our Native Americans and among our long-term care facilities.  So an active monitoring program that’s active, integrated, and innovative.
And then combining this with the third element, which is the rapid response program, relying on CDC to be working with state and local governments to ensure that every symptomatic case — and, critically, the asymptomatic cases — are quickly tracked and traced to ensure that we can not only control this epidemic, but predict outbreaks before they expand.
And then, finally, the plan includes an approach of using science and technology to develop even newer platforms, more efficient testing, really ensuring that the antibody tests that are utilized and recommended by both FDA and CDC have high quality and predicting both exposure to the virus and antibody development.
And then, finally, working on innovative tests that could be high throughput and point-of-care — an antigen-based test or a point-of-care expanded nucleic acid test.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you.  Good job.
Admiral, please.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you, Ambassador Birx.  If I could have the next slide, please.
I want to spend just a couple minutes about telling — going over where we’ve been, but more importantly where we’re going.  I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct phases.
First is our launch phase, when we were really engaging the emerging epidemic and the types of things we need to do.  For example, mobilize the private sector to develop tests and have EUAs.  And I think you know, over the past two months, the FDA has issued 67 emergency use authorizations, which is far outpacing anything that has been done or could ever have been imagined.  Galvanizing the research community and the commercial labs — the reason why we’re here with ACLA labs, having done about 3 million tests, is because of that day when it was galvanized by the President and the Vice President.
We also set models in the community.  Those first community-based testing sites that were federally supported and, really, under the direction of the U.S. Public Health Service — people who had been in Japan, testing people on the Diamond Princess, to assure that it would be done right and it would be done safely for everyone involved.
Then we moved to, really, scaling.  That phase was very, very important because we knew we needed to be at an immense scale to enter the third phase about supporting opening again.  This again — for example, a lot of my life is about swabs.  It was enhancing the production capability of a small company in Maine, called Puritan, that you’ll hear a whole lot more about that has — that is, sort of, the swab provider for the country — but also, because of the FDA actions and the actions of scientific community, being able to broaden the types to spun polyester, so U.S. Cotton can now come in and start delivering, within the next couple of weeks, 3 million swabs per week of a different type.
It also did things like expanding the community-based testing sites.  Whereas we started small with the commercial partners, you see today, right now, we have 73 of these 2.0 sites going to 110.  And very importantly, this demonstrated the model.  And 68 percent of those sites are in communities of moderate or high social vulnerability.  And 22 percent are in the highest social vulnerability communities so that we can make sure that testing gets where it needs to be.  You’ve just heard that that could be expanded to thousands of sites.
And finally, stage three, which is very exciting: coordinating with governors to support testing plans and rapid response programs.  Over the past week, a multidisciplinary team from the White House, HHS, FDA, FEMA has met virtually with multidisciplinary teams from every state, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to understand what their testing aspirations are and to make sure that we can meet those demands.  We’re going to have another round of those calls this week.
But as we talked about earlier today, we will be able to supply every state with the — with the supplies and the tests that they need.  That will dramatically increase the number of tests we’ve done to this point.  And just to give you an idea, the supplies that we will be providing to states — the minimum that we’re supplying to states is approximately double, in that month, than the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months to now accumulated — to give you an idea of the amount of testing that we’re going to be — going to be doing.
So I’m very exciting right now, as we complete this ecosystem with the large reference labs — the LabCorp and Quest providing the very high-throughput, large-scale testing; the galvanizing of the hospitals and academic labs that Dr. Birx has done, by a machine to machine, understanding and promoting that with the governors; and, of course, using point-of-care testing when and where that’s very important to stop outbreaks or in remote areas, like in the Indian Health Service or in Alaska.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Great job.  Thanks, Brett.
Okay.  So with that, we’re here to answer some questions, and Mike is up here also.  So, we’ll answer.
Steve, please go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-33/

April 24, 2020
5:39 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Thank you.  We continue to see evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and working at a very high level.  Nationwide, the percent of tests that come back positive has declined very significantly.
Last week, roughly 38 percent of the tests in New York were positive.  This week, that number is down to 28 percent.  New cases in New York are down 50 percent compared to a week ago.  And fatalities are down 40 percent over the same period.  In Louisiana, the rate of positive test result had declined from 25 percent down to 15 percent in the last seven days alone.
Eighteen states now show a decline in a number of positive tests in the last seven days.  So, over the last seven days, there’s been very, very significant progress.
Half of all Americans live in states that have now taken steps to open their economies.  Just yesterday, Governors Gavin Newsom, California; Tim Walz of Minnesota; and Bill Lee of Tennessee announced additional plans to restart certain sectors.
We ask every American to maintain vigilance and hygiene, social distancing and voluntary use of face coverings.  We’re opening our country.  It’s very exciting to see.  We have a lot of talent involved, from governors down to people that just stand there and help you with the doors.  There’s been tremendous talent involved and tremendous spirit from our country.  The country is a great place, and it’s going to be greater than ever before.  I really believe that.  I think there’s going to be a tremendous upward shift.
I spoke with Tim Cook, today, of Apple.  And they have a good sense of the market, and he feels it’s going to be a “V.”  The “V” is sharply upward later on as we actually get it fully open.
Today, I signed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, providing $320 billion to keep American workers on the payroll.  Thirty billion dollars of the Paycheck Protection funds will be reserved for small financial institutions, including those that serve minority and distressed communities, extending vital relief to thousands of African American and Hispanic American small-business owners and their employees.
The bill also delivers $75 billion for hospitals — so badly needed for hospitals; they’ve taken a very big hit — and medical providers.  In areas less affected by the virus, hospitals and doctors should work with their state and local health officials on ways to safely resume elective medical treatments and care.
Under the CARES Act, we’re sending back payments to millions of American workers.  More than 80 million Americans have already received their payment: $3,400 for a typical family of four.  Three thousand four hundred dollars.  That’s great.  And you deserve it.
The CARES Act requires that the federal government send out a notice of what benefits Americans are receiving.  To fulfill the requirement, the Treasury Department is mailing a letter to me.  It will include the amount, their economic impact payment, how it will arrived — direct deposit, check, or prepaid debit card — as well as a message to the nation, letting each American know that we are getting through this challenge together as one American family.  And that’s what’s been happening.
The whole world is watching us.  You have 184 countries out there that have been hit, and now it’s probably higher than that.  But they’re all watching us.  They’re all watching and they’re calling, and they respect what we’re doing, so much.
I spoke with the leaders of numerous countries today.  They’re asking if we can send them ventilators, and I’m agreeing to do it.  We have tremendous capacity — now, over-capacity of ventilators.  We’re filling up stockpiles for our states and for ourselves.  The federal government has over 10,000 ventilators, and we could have a lot more if we wanted to do that.  But we’re helping Mexico, Honduras, Indonesia, France.  We’re sending to France.  We’re sending to Spain.  We’re sending to Italy.  And we’ll probably be sending to Germany, should they need them.
Over the last three years, we built the strongest economy and the most successful country the world has ever seen.  Greatest economy the world has ever seen.  Nobody has ever done anything like what we were able to do.
And we will rebuild that economy.  Our economy in the not-too-distant future, I really believe, with all that we’ve learned and all that we’ve done, will be just as strong and maybe stronger than ever before — even stronger than it was just two months ago.
Some interesting note is that the FDA approved the first at-home COVID-19 test kit.  It just got approved.  And Dr. Stephen — where is Stephen?  Stephen Hahn.  Stephen?  — is going to say a couple of words about that and some other things.
I want to thank Stephen.  The FDA has been incredible. They’ve been approving not only this, but they’ve been approving many things at a pace that’s never happened before.  And they’re being very safe about it, as Stephen told me.  He’s told me — told me very strongly.  But at the same time, they’re approving things at record numbers, in a record — at a record rate.  And it’s really been helpful.
Many tests are going on — many vaccine tests and tests of every different kind.  And things are happening.  Just like this event, things are happening very rapidly.  And I’d like to have Stephen tell you a little bit about it.
Thank you very much.  Stephen, please.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I appreciate the opportunity to tell you about what’s happening at the FDA.  We have a team of more than 18,000 employees, including 10,000 scientists, doctors, pharmacists, and nurses, and they’ve been working around the clock because, as you probably know, many of the medical products that are being used for the COVID-19 outbreak are, in fact, regulated by FDA.  The staff have been hard at work authorizing tests and other medical products.
As part of these efforts to support diagnostic test development during this global pandemic, the President has asked us, and under his leadership, to actually cut down as many barriers as we possibly could to get medical products into the medical community, and we have done that, of course recognizing the urgency of the situation.
I do want to emphasize what the President said, that — is that we are very much paying attention to safety and with respect to test validity and reliability of those tests.
And I think it’s really important to understand how far we’ve come in just a few short months.  The academic community, which I come from; the private sector; the government — we’ve come together to develop diagnostics for a completely new infectious disease.
And it’s really important — we’ve heard from many test developers, both in academia and in the manufacturing world: This normally takes years to develop.  You’ve heard Dr. Birx talk about the fact that HIV tests has taken many, many years to develop.  This has happened in weeks and months.  We’ve been laser focused on working with both industry and academia to actually make this happen.
To date, under our emergency use authorization approach, we’ve quickly reviewed and authorized 63 tests, both diagnostic, as well as serologic — that is the antibody test.  We’ve had several point-of-care tests, and that’s important because those can be done in the emergency room or in a doctor’s office, et cetera, and much more convenient for the patient.
And this week, as the President said, we authorized the first at-home test by a company called LabCorp.  This is a test where, under certain circumstances, with a doctor’s supervision, a test can be mailed to a patient and the patient can perform the self-swab and then mail it back and get the results after that time — all under the guidance of a licensed physician.
And we’re not just letting up with these 63 tests we’ve approved.  We are working with more than 400 test developers who are pursuing authorization for their diagnostics under our current policies.  And under our regulatory approach, which is quite flexible, many other tests are becoming available.
We are — we have heard, and have reported to us, 220 labs around the country have begun patient testing using their own validated tests.  This has allowed us to increase, significantly, tests around the country.
I updated you earlier this week on serologic tests — these antibody tests that are used to detect natural immunity — and the FDA’s approach to help make these tests available.  While these are just one part of our larger response effort, they can play a role in helping move our economy forward by helping healthcare professionals identify those who have immunity to the COVID-19.
And just finally, when it comes to therapeutics, we are leaving no stone unturned in finding treatments for COVID-19.  You do know that we don’t have any approved currently therapeutics for COVID-19, but we are actively involved with both the academic and the commercial and private sector to find those.  Seventy-two trials of therapeutics are underway in the United States under FDA oversight and 211 are in the planning stages, so we expect to see more.  This includes convalescent plasma, as well as antiviral therapies.
Work continues on vaccines.  And two firms have announced that the FDA has authorized their trials to go forward, one of which we’ve mentioned here before.
And finally, in response to the President’s and Task Force’s request, we’ve stood up the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program.  We are leaving no stone unturned, as I said, and we’re working around the clock to develop these therapeutics for the American people.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-32/

5:48 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.  I’m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses.
At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.  You see states are starting to open up now, and it’s very exciting to see.  I think it’s very awe-inspiring.  We’re coming out of it, and we’re coming out of it well.
And we’re — really, I’m very happy the governors have been — the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it’s — it’s, really, pretty impressive to see.  I’ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we’re leading the way.  We’re really leading the way in so many different ways.
I’m also very pleased that Harvard — as you know, it’s Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us.  And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at.  And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it’s about $350 million, and they’ve either not gone out or we’ve renegotiated it and they’re not getting them.
So — and it’s — in a couple of cases, they’re sending them back and sending them back immediately.  So I think it was very nice.  I want to thank Harvard in particular.  They acted very quickly and decisively.  And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it.  So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions.
The bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses.
As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we’re making great progress.  In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak — week.  Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases.  Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms.  That’s a big number.
To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance.  And we all understand that very well; we’ve gone over it many, many times.  This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering.
A safe and phased reopening of our economy — it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way.  On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back.  We’re winning this, and we’re going to win it, and we’re going to keep watching.  We’re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy.
With each passing day, we’re learning more and more about this enemy.  The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces.  The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments.
I have to say that, very excitingly, we’re going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while.  It was a great report you gave.  And he’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight.  Wait until you hear the numbers.  You won’t even believe them.
U.S. trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK, and China.  That’s big news.  And we’re — a lot of trials are going on.  We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this, both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics.
We must be careful in all conditions, but we will — we will get this done.  We’re very close to a vaccine.  Unfortunately, we’re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time.  But we’ll get it done.
And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he’s going to be doing and what he’s going to be saying and the report that he’s about to give.  I think it’s going to be something that nobody has ever heard.  It’ll be brand-new information and very important information.
My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies.  We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days.  And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process.  Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask.  So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks.  And it’s working very well.
We just want the hospitals and the institutions, where it is, to use it.  A lot of people don’t use it.  They’re so used to getting a new mask, they don’t want to use it.  They want to go and immediately get a new one.  We’re asking them to use the sterilization process.  Every bit as good — up to 20 times.  Think of that.
In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch.  It’s really a military operation.
The Vice President is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by-county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection.  And this is equipment and things that are incredible.  It’s personal protective equipment.  It’s incredible, and it’s all brand new and at the highest level.  We’re getting only the highest level.  And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak.
This way, the governor should know exactly what’s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge.  We’re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state.  When we can’t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors.  And we’re getting them fast, and we’re notifying them very strongly so they know it’s there.  Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed.
Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation’s incredible county emergency management teams who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end, to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies, and save countless American lives.  We salute these heroic officials on the frontlines.
As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus.  The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick — and frankly, those that are very sick.  Nearly 3,000 patients are now enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, receiving transfusions nationwide.
And I want to thank all of the people that recovered, for what they’ve done.  They — as I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they’re saying, “I want to donate blood.  I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.”  It’s really quite incredible.
Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type.  This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high-risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place.  A very big deal.
Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks, and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution.  I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you’re doing, because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help.  And they’ve been so great, and I just appreciate it.
My administration has also partnered with leading — and we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence.
Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies.  And we’re collaborating with tech firms, universities, and our national labs to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines.  That search is going on, and it’s being — I think you’ll see in the future — you’ll see it’s very successful.  Ultimately, it’ll be a tremendous success.  Great progress is being made at a rapid pace — a pace like no other.
We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology, and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague, and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity.
Our country is going to do fantastically well.  You see what’s going on.  There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better, and that’s what’s going to happen.
So with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up — Vice President.  Say a few words please, Mike.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon.  Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met.  And while our hearts are with the families of those who have lost their life to the coronavirus and those who are struggling with serious illness today, our team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, informs us that the data continues to show promising signs of progress.
The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be past their peak.  And we are seeing consistent declines in hospitalization and cases in regions across the country.
Our only conclusion is that we’re getting there, America, because the American people have put into practice the President’s guidelines of social distancing because you’ve been listening and adhering to the guidance of state and local officials.  We are — we’re making — we’re making meaningful progress.  In a very real sense, sparing Americans to be exposed to the coronavirus and, no less extent, saving lives.
Our task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead — as states implement their policies, including phased reopening — that we’ll preserve those gains.  We do believe, by early summer, we could be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us.
Earlier today, we also had a conference call led by Secretary Ben Carson and leaders from HUD about the President’s announcement yesterday that he is repurposing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority communities.  Secretary Carson will convene the council tomorrow, and we’ll be reporting tomorrow afternoon on their progress.
We want to thank the more than 270 leaders of organizations dedicated to housing, homelessness, and improving the lives of people across our urban communities — not only for being with us today, for the way they have partnered with our administration and partnered with state and local officials to put the health of all of their constituencies first.
As the President mentioned, we’ll — you’ll receive a report that our task force received formally this week from Bill Bryan of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security.  He will outline, as the President said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer.
On the subject of testing: At the present moment, we have reports of 4.93 million tests having been performed across America.  And encouraging news: As states have been engaging commercial labs at a higher level across the country, yesterday our commercial lab system did more than 100,000 tests in a single day.  So we’re beginning to activate all of the capacity.
And tomorrow, at the President’s direction, our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation’s governors to talk about the progress that they are making on testing.  And we’re going to hear from governors about the practices that — and methods that they are employing to significantly increase testing following our briefing about capacity in laboratories this past Monday.
For instance, Governor Mike DeWine just announced that Ohio’s testing has been greatly expanded after the FDA approved Thermo Fisher’s new extraction reagent, saying, in his words, that the action, quote, “probably doubled, maybe even tripled testing in Ohio virtually overnight.”
Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota announced, along with the state’s healthcare system, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota, what he described as a breakthrough for rapid, widespread testing — able to test more than 20,000 people using a molecular test per day.
Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa launched the Test Iowa Initiative that will triple testing capacity by partnering with Nomi Health and DOMO.  She also worked with the University of Iowa Hospitals to leverage further capacity.
And Governor Eric Holcomb and Governor Andy Beshear, of Indiana and Kentucky respectively, both announced additional drive-through testing locations.
Our priority has always been to focus first on those impacted by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare workers ministering to their needs every day.  And I know, Mr. President, how proud you are that our men and women in uniform have come alongside our healthcare workers in communities most impacted, and I know the American people are proud as well.
As of today, FEMA reports that 35,000 National Guard have been deployed across the country to aid in our coronavirus response.  Governor Kevin Stitt of Ohio [Oklahoma] actually deployed the National Guard to hospitals across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it in to state emergency management and FEMA.
And Governor Greg Abbott of Texas actually mobilized more than 1,200 National Guard and 45 teams to provide greater access to testing.
Along with the National Guard, at the President’s direction today, more than 4,500 active duty military doctors, nurses, and medical assistants have been deployed across the country.  Yesterday, 1,013 medical professionals in our military were actually deployed to 19 hospitals in 7 states to support those amazing healthcare workers.
And with 4.4 million more Americans filing for unemployment in the past week, I joined the President in welcoming passage in the House today of the Paycheck Protection Program.  It’ll support working families.  It’ll allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for a period of two months.  But it also, as the President requested, included $75 billion to assist hospitals across the country.
And in that spirit, the President and I will continue to urge states across the country: Given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries, wherever possible — either statewide or on a county-by-county basis.  We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals and we’ll be working with states to enable that.
In that vein, Governor Doug Ducey exec- — issued an executive order not long ago, allowing elective surgeries beginning May 1 for hospitals that meet certain preparedness criteria.
And Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, is allowing elective clinical procedures to begin on April 21st.
Finally, Mr. President, the task force received today our first report on state reopening plans.  At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans.  Thirteen of those were actually released since you unveiled the Opening Up America Guidelines to our governors and to the nation last week.
And to your point, Mr. President, states are beginning to make those plans.  And we’re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that’s contemplated in our Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.
For instance, Governor Mike Parson of Missouri announced the “Show Me Strong” Recovery Plan as two initial phases intended to protect the most at-risk.
Governor Tom Wolf announced the Plan for Pennsylvania that would begin May 8th — will end a stay-at-home order for just portions of Pennsylvania.  But the plan, again, requires regions to have fewer than 50 new positive cases per 100,000 for a period of 14 days, and it also lays out a phased reopening roadmap.
Governor Kate Brown of Oregon updated their framework for reopening, doing three phases — again, on a county-by-county basis.
And Governor Brad Little of Idaho released “Rebound Idaho” in just the last few days that will consist of four phases and require specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen.
Mr.  President, with the — with the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, states are making plans.  And at your direction, our task force will continue to work very closely, providing them with the data, providing them with the resources to be able to implement those plans in a safe and responsible way.
So, with that, let me just end where I began, and to say thank you to the American people.  The progress that we are seeing is a testament to what all of you have done; to our extraordinary healthcare workers; to a partnership between the federal government and to state and local official.  And I’m confident it’s also owing to the prayers of millions of Americans each and every day.
All of that combined, we’re — we’re slowing the spread.  We’re protecting the most vulnerable.  We’re saving lives.  And every single day, we are one day closer to opening up America again.
With that, Mr. President, I’d be pleased to call Bill forward.  Bill Bryan leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security and now will make a presentation on their recent study.
ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:  Thank you, Mr.  Vice President.  Thank you, Mr.  President —
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bill.
ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: — for this opportunity to do this today.
Good afternoon everybody.  My name is Bill Bryan and I lead the Science and Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Over the last several months, we’ve intensified the Department’s R&D efforts to identify and deliver information that informs our response to COVID-19.  S&T is working to identify, develop, deploy, and deploy the tools and information to support our response to this crisis.
As part of our efforts, we’re leveraging the unique capabilities of S&T’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center to study the biology of the COVID-19 virus.  This center is a high-biocontainment laboratory located in Frederick, Maryland.  It was established in the early 2000s, in response to the Amerithrax attacks, and where we study, characterize, analyze, and develop countermeasures for biological threats to the homeland.  We work closely with the CDC, FDA, HHS, and also our Department of Defense colleagues and many others.
Yesterday, I shared the emerging results of our work that we’re doing now with the Coronavirus Task Force.  And today, I would like to share certain trends that we believe are important.
If I may have the first slide, please.  And while that’s coming up, our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus — both surfaces and in the air.  We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus.
So let me illustrate with this first slide.  If you look to the right, you’ll see that term “half-life,” with a bunch of timestamps on there.
First, let me tell you what a “half-life” is.  We don’t measure the virus as far as how long we live on the surface; we have to measure the decay of the virus in terms of its half-life, because we don’t know certain elements.  We don’t know how much a person expectorates when he — when he spits — right? — when he sneezes, whatever the case may be.  We don’t know how much virus is in there.  So it’s — that has a long — a bearing on how long the virus is going to be alive and active.  So we measure it in half life because half-life doesn’t change.
So if you look at an 18-hour half-life, what you’re basically saying is that every 18 hours, the virus — it’s the life of the virus is cut in half.  So if you start with 1,000 particles of the virus, in 18 hours, you’re down to 500.  And 18 hours after that, you’re down to 250, and so on and so forth.  That’s important, as I explain in the rest of the chart.
If you look at the first three lines, when you see the word “surface,” we’re talking about nonporous surfaces: door handles, stainless steel.  And if you look at the — as the temperature increases, as the humidity increases, with no sun involved, you can see how drastically the half-life goes down on that virus.  So the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace, just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity.
If you look at the fourth line, you inject summer — the sunlight into that.  You inject UV rays into that.  The same effects on line two — as 70 to 35 degrees with 80 percent humidity on the surface.  And look at line four, but now you inject the sun.  The half-life goes from six hours to two minutes.  That’s how much of an impact UV rays has on the virus.
The last two lines are aerosols.  What does it do in the air?  We have a very unique capability — I was discussing this with the President prior to coming out; he wanted me to convey it to you — on how we do this.  I believe we’re the only lab in the country that has this capability.
But if you can imagine a Home Depot bucket — a five-gallon Home Depot bucket — we’re able to take a particle — and this was developed and designed by our folks at the NBACC.  We’re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperatures, various humidity levels, multiple different kinds of environmental conditions, to include sunlight.  And we’re able to measure the decay of that virus while it’s suspended in the air.  This is how we do our aerosol testing.
We worked with John Hopkin Applied Physics Lab, and we actually developed a larger drum to do actually more testing.  And it’s four times the size of that.  So this is the capability that we bring to this effort.
So, in summary, within the conditions we’ve tested to date, the virus in droplets of saliva survives best in indoors and dry conditions.  The virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva.  And that’s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done, number one, with the COVID-19 virus, and number two, in saliva or respiratory fluids.
And thirdly, the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.  And when you — when you look at that chart, look at the aerosol as you breathe it; you put it in a room, 70 to 75 degrees, 20 percent humidity, low humidity, it lasts — the half-life is about an hour.  But you get outside, and it cuts down to a minute and a half.  A very significant difference when it gets hit with UV rays.
And, Mr. President, while there are many unknown links in the COVID-19 transmission chain, we believe these trends can support practical decision making to lower the risks associated with the virus.
If I can have my next slide.
And when that — while that comes up, you’ll see a number of some practical applications.  For example, increasing the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminated indoor spaces appears to reduce the stability of the virus.  And extra care may be warranted for dry environments that do not have exposure to solar light.
We’re also testing disinfectants readily available.  We’ve tested bleach, we’ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.  And I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that’s with no manipulation, no rubbing — just spraying it on and letting it go.  You rub it and it goes away even faster.  We’re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva.
This is not the end of our work as we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our findings into practical applications to mitigate exposure and transmission.  I would like to thank the President and thank the Vice President for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in addressing this pandemic.  I would also like to thank the scientists, not only in S&T and the NBACC, but to the larger scientific and R&D community.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Bill.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-31/

6:10 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  A lot of tremendous things are happening.  The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide.  Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing.  The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what’s going on.  And they’re going down; they’re going in the right direction.  Cases in the Boston area are now declining.  The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific.  And Detroit is past its peak.
These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen.  It’s very exciting.  It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what’s happening.  And people are getting ready and they’re all excited.
I do want to mention a man who’s done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield.  He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus.  Totally misquoted.  I spoke to him.  He said it was ridiculous.  He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time.  And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we’ll take care of.  We’re going to knock it out.  We’ll knock it out fast.  But that’s what he was referring to: coming together at the same time.
And I think rather than waiting, I’d ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn’t say it was a big — a big explosion.  The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate.  The statement wasn’t bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is — as I say, that’s fake news.  And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew.  They were asked to change it, and they wouldn’t do that.  And it was false.
So I’ll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain.  Please.  Thank you, Doctor.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I really do think it’s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people.
When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of the fall, winter — next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time: influenza and the coronavirus-19.
But I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say.  I didn’t say that this was going to be worse.  I said it was going to be more complic- — or more difficult and potentially complicated because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.
I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation’s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to sustain the containment mode.  Those of you who heard me talk before, I’ve told you that in January and February — up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases.  We were in the containment mode.  And then, unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into this extreme mitigation.
We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter season so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring.
I have confidence that our public health response of early case recognition that we’ve talked about, isolation, and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective public health strategy so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode.
Again, that will be supported by the American public’s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate.
The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence.  One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront.
Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-30/

5:46 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much everyone.  We had a very big day today.  I want to start by saying that our love and prayers of every American continue to be with our fellow citizens who have lost a cherished friend or a family member to the virus.
Amidst our grief, we’re making tremendous strides against this invisible enemy.  Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals, our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world.  And that’s due to a lot of — a lot of things, but our medical professionals have been incredible.
Since we announced our “Guidelines on Opening Up America,” as we call it — we say “Opening up America,” and we add the word agun [sic].  I think we can add the word, probably, “again.”  But that’s what it is: We’re opening up America again.
Twenty states representing 40 percent of the U.S. population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future.  So that’s 20 states; that’s about 40 percent of our country.  They’re moving along pretty quickly.  Three announced today, as you know, and they’re going to be doing it safely.  They’re going to be doing it with tremendous passion.  There’s — they want to get back to work.  The country wants to get back to work.
A short time ago, the Senate passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act, with additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, hospitals, and testing.  A lot of money for all of them, especially for our workers and our small businesses.
My administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical 482-billion-dollar funding package.  We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small-business support to keep workers on the payroll; $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid, and very badly — I’m very proud of that; and $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts.
I urge the House to pass the bill, and they’re going to be voting on it, I imagine, very — very soon.
I think while we’re here, and so he’s a very busy man, as you know — Secretary Mnuchin — he’s going to be running back, so I thought we’d do — we’ll talk about that now, and we’ll take a couple of questions on that.  And then he can go and start phase four, as the ink is drying.
Probably, they’ll be voting tomorrow in the House, but shortly.  Shortly.  And I think we have tremendous support.
So, Steve, please come up.  Say a few words.  Steve?  Yeah.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you for all your work with us to get this passed.  I’d especially like to thank Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and the entire Senate for passing this.  I’d also like to thank Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, who have been working with us around the clock as well, and our Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, who was also very instrumental in this.
Let me just comment.  We’ve had tremendous support for the PPP.  This gives us another $310 billion for the PPP.  We look forward to the House passing this tomorrow and being up and running quickly after that.
This also gives us $50 billion for disaster loans, EIDL loans.  That will allow the SBA to make $300 billion of disaster loans, all for small businesses.  It also allows us, as the President said, more money to hospitals and an unprecedented amount of money for testing.  And again, I think we understand hospitals — not only the hospitals that have been impacted by coronavirus, but more importantly, many hospitals that have been shut down, and making sure that the doctors and nurses get money.
Now, let me make just one more comment on the program.  We have over a million companies that have received this with less than 10 workers.  So there is very broad participation in really small business.  I will comment there have been some big businesses that have taken these loans.  I was pleased to see that Shake Shack returned the money.  We will be putting out some FAQs.  There is a certification that people are making.
And I asked people — just make sure: The intent of this was for business that needed the money.  We’ll put out an FAQ.  But again, the intent of this money was not for big public companies that have access to capital.
THE PRESIDENT:  And not for Harvard, you might say, Steve.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-3/

5:39 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everyone.  Thank you.  Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence; we’re going to have a resurgence, too.  At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion.
During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody has become very familiar with.
We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.  For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially.  You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30 percent, 25 percent.  In Detroit, as an example, it’s down by over 50 percent.  Congratulations.  And, in New Orleans, where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65 percent.
Thirty states have just one case or less per 1,000 people — far fewer cases per capita, as an example, than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.
My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs.  We hope to have an agreement very soon.  And hopefully tomorrow, the Senate is going to be able to vote.  A lot of progress has been made on that — tremendous progress.  It’s a great plan.  It’s a great plan.  It’s helped a lot of people.  So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate.
And based on the record-low price of oil that you’ve been seeing — it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people — we’re filling up our National Petroleum Reserves.  Strategic — you know, the Strategic Reserves.  And we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves.  That would top it out.  That would be first time in a long time it’s been topped out.  We’d get it for the right price.
We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional $75 billion — our deal; the deal we’re talking about — $75 billion for hospitals and other healthcare providers.  Many providers and their employees have taken a huge financial hit in recent weeks.  And visits, elective procedures, surgeries, et cetera, et cetera, were canceled.  We think that they can all get back online.  They’ll get it done.  The hospitals have really been fantastic.  The hospitals, they’ve — they’ve stepped up to the plate.  They’ve really done a great job.  We appreciate it so much.
For areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments.  HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country.  We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African American and Hispanic American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need.
Earlier today, Vice President Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus.  He had a great call.  It was a great call — very positive in, I’d say, every way.  Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states — many, many labs.  We’re providing you with the list.  We’ll show it to you now if you need it.  We’ll give you the details.  But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able.
Some of the governors, like, as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list.  He didn’t understand too much about what was going on.  So now I think he’ll be able to do that.  It’s pretty simple.  But they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out.  We’ll work with him and work with all of the governors.
Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity.  Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand.  And it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it.  The governor, as an example, Pritzker from Illinois did not understand his capacity.  Not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support — I mean, you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing.  And they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up.  And you’ll be seeing that; we’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it.
I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomo’s remarks during his press conference today.  He said: The President is right.  The states’ testing is up to the states to do, which will implement the test and logistically coordinate the tests.  We have about 300 labs in New York and they do it.  And they’re great labs, actually.  And it’s my job to coordinate those 300 labs.  I think the President is right when he says that the states should lead.
And the governor is really — they’re really getting — they’re getting it together in New York.  A lot of good things are happening in New York.  And I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow.  He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon.  Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people.  So we look forward to that.
The — some of the articles that just recently came about — if you remember, I put out a statement today.  For a month, it was all “ventilator, ventilator, ventilator.”  That’s all people could talk about was ventilators.  And we did a great job with that.  We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly.  We have so many now that, at some point soon, we’re going to be helping Mexico and Italy and other countries.  We’ll be sending them ventilators, which they desperately need.  They were a position — they were not in a position to build them themselves.
But we have thousands being built.  Every state has had — they have the ventilators.  If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our Federal Reserve — our “stockpile,” as they call it.  And we did a great job with the ventilators.
Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it — other than the fair press.  But — so then you say, “Gee, I — they need ventilators.”  We don’t need ventilators.  And that’s — that’s under pressure we did that.
Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one.  And a story that just came out: “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story.”  I’m sure you love to see that.  That’s by Rich Lowry, a respected journalist and person.  “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story” — which, unfortunately, you did.
And here’s another one that just came out.  Kyle Smith.  “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t.”  “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t” — because we got it fixed.  And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators.  So if a thing like this should happen again, they’ve got them.
The stories on testing are all over the place — that we’re actually in good shape.  I’m going to have the Vice President and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time.  You’re going to see some interesting things.
I thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who has done an incredible job, tell you where we are.  You know we’re still building beds and hospitals for people that need them.  I guess the hospital business generally is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re — we’re creating a lot of space for people, just in case.  And in some cases, they probably will be using them.
But I thought the general — he’s been so impressive and done such a great job.  I thought, on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government, he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now.
Thank you very much.  General.
LIEUTENANT GENERAL SEMONITE:  Well, thank you, Mr.  President.  I just want you to know that, on behalf of all of us in the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those patients and all those victims that have been affected by this terrible virus.
And the President of Vice President talk all the time about the heroes, but when I’ve been out there, I’ve seen the doctors, I’ve seen the nurses, and all those that have worked very, very hard, and we’re just — we’re just so proud to be part of this noble calling.
I — for my team, I really made it very, very simple.  I said there’s three legs of this stool, and they all have “S’s”: There are “sites” — in other words, hospitals; we’ve got to worry about “supplies”; and we’ve got to worry about “staff.”
And so, right when Governor Cuomo called the President, about almost 30 days ago, he said, “I need some help” — worrying about what could be tens of thousands of hotel room — I mean, of hospital room shortages.
So the President and Secretary of Defense asked us to fly to Albany with a team.  And on the way up, we understood how complex of a challenge this was, and we knew there was no way you can solve a complex catastrophe with a complicated solution.  We needed a very, very simple solution to be able to then work with HHS, to be able to work with FEMA, to be able to work with the Vice President’s task force, and then to be able to power this down all the way down to the local level.
Some of the governors asked us to try to build a hospital in a parking lot or a field in two or three weeks.  You can’t physically do that.  So what we said was, “Let’s go to where there’s an existing facility.”  And I’m going to kind of make this in two big pots: those that are either hotel rooms or college dormitories, smaller rooms — or those that are in real large areas, like field houses or convention centers.
And we designed those standard facilities that could be either non-COVID or COVID, and then we got that approved here at the federal government to be able to then power that back down.
So we went to Governor Cuomo, and he said, right up front, “I love the concept.  I need you in the Javits Center.  I’m ready to start having you work tomorrow afternoon.”
So when we flew back that afternoon, the next day, we basically built this standard design and then continued to be able to power it down, all the way down through the rest of the team.
So I just want to show you a couple of slides here.  And we’ll — we’ll kind of let you know where we’re at right now, Mr President.
We had to do a bunch of assessments, so somewhere in the order of over 1,100 different locations we went to.  And we work for FEMA, and we work for the President, and we work for governors and mayors.  And we said, “What do you think your demand is going to be?”  And based on a lot of the modeling that’s been in this room here, we were able to understand when the peak curve was, but we also were able to understand where’s the bed shortage.
So then, these 1,100 facilities — right now today, sir, we’re actually executing 32 different facilities.  That’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds.  Eight of those are all done.  We’ve still got a lot more to complete.  And in the next week and a half, we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities.
We’ve got some pending.  Some mayors and governors are still wondering do they have enough bed space.  And what’s important here is we need a very agile plan.  You can’t do something three weeks ago and think that this is going to continue to stay, because this virus gets a vote.  And this entire team — the federal government has tried to be as agile as they can, supporting those states and those governors.
The beauty of the plan, though, was it doesn’t have to be built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.  So we designed about an extra 52 facilities.  We gave those to the governors.  And I’ve got to be very, very laudatory to the governors.  They then imposed and put a lot of those on the — on the ground and did those themselves.
So let’s go to — I’m just going to show you some real simple pictures here.  Go to the next slide, if you don’t mind.
So this is an example of the Javits Center, and you heard the President talk about it quite a few times.  This one, about 2,100 bed spaces.  What you get is about an 11- or 12-foot-square cubicle.  There is lights in there.  There’s a nurse call, so if you need to be able to call the nurse station.  There are nurse spaces throughout.  There’s pharmacies throughout.  This one started as non-COVID, but then we came back in and put in central oxygen.  So everybody has oxygen right behind their bed to be able to take care of those patients.  And again built this one, and about 1,000 patients treated.
Let’s go to the next one.
I was up in Detroit with Governor Whitmer, and she walked us through and told us her intent.  Here’s what — she needed to do this in the TCF Center.  You’ll see all the cubicles that are laid out.  This is right in the middle of a convention floor where there might be like a boat show or a car show, and then we went in and we built 970 different capabilities there.
And again, a lot of great work by my guys in the Corps of Engineers and the rest of the mayors in the cities’ team all pulling together.
Let’s go to the next one.
This is called the McCormick Place.  Governor Pritzker sat us down.  He said, “Here’s, kind of, our intent on what you want to do.”  Mayor Lightfoot walked us through, and we went into another large convention center.  This is actually 3,000 bed spaces.  This was a very, very large build.  And got this one done in a relatively short time.
And then here’s another one that kind of helps you understand the dynamic here.  Go to the next one, please.
This is in Miami Beach, and I flew in to see Governor DeSantis.  And my guys had kind of scoped out about 450 beds, and he said, “Todd, how long is it going to take to build this?”  And we kind of said, “Probably until the 27th of April.”  And he went to his health people and he said, “How long do you need?”  And he said, “The day we need this is the 21st of April.”  And I told my guys, “You don’t have until the 27th.  Figure out how to get it done by the 20th.”
This is where you don’t get to build to be able to have the perfect solution.  You got to be able to get the mission essential done.  Lives are on the line here, and we’ve got to be able to get everything done to be able to save those lives.
And let’s go to the last one here.  This is one we’re doing right now: Colorado.  This is in Denver, in another gigantic convention center.  You’ll see all the different cubicles here to be able to just bring in that oxygen.  Six-inch copper pipe that comes in, and it’s all piped throughout the entire convention center.  Six miles of pipe that’s able to go in to be able to make that happen.
And in closing, I just want to be able to say that we are very, very focused in the Corps of Engineers on getting this done, but this is all about the team — the federal team, the state team, the local team.  The Vice President and his task force, and on a lot of the people sitting here, have informed us of how fast we need to go.  And it goes back to, again, all the governors and the mayors to make this happen.
But I want to reiterate: President Trump has called me three times, and Secretary Esper has been on the phone at least one of those times, and said, “What else do we need to do to set you up for success?  Is there any other knobs we can turn to be able to help you go?”  And you think about that equation of those three “S’s.”  I think that with the federal government and the mayors in the cities here, we’ve effectively taken that first “S” out of the equation.
And, sir, I can’t tell you, of all the things I’ve done in my career, this is a noble calling to be able to step up and save American lives.
So, with that, sir, I thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.  Thank you very much.  Anybody have a question for the general while he’s here?  Anybody?  Because I think he’s very self-explanatory.  He’s done an incredible job.
Jeff, do you have a question?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-29/

6:28 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I’d like to begin by saying that we’re continuing to negotiate with the Democrats to get our great workers and small businesses all over the country taken care of.  I think we — we’re getting close to a deal.  It could happen.  It could happen.  A lot of good work has been going on, and we could have an answer tomorrow.  And we’re going to see what — what exactly does take place.
We’re also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals, who have been hurt very badly.  The rural hospitals, for a long time, have not been treated properly.  We’re looking to help them, and beyond.  So we’re looking at hospitals also, as part of the package.  And we’ll see how that all comes out.
But a lot of good things are happening.  Some very good negotiations.  I just got off the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury, and we have some very good negotiations going on right now.  And I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow, but we’ll see.
America continues to make steady progress in our war against the virus.  As of today, we’ve tested 4.18 million Americans.  That’s a record anywhere in the world.  The United States has now conducted more total tests than all of the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada.
And our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people.  So we’ve — we’ve done more testing than all of these countries combined: France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, and Australia, Sweden, and Canada.  That’s something.  Right?
We’re doing a great job.  We’re — we are.  This team is an incredible team, and that includes Army Corps of Engineers, a lot of our military people, our admirals, our generals.  Got one of our great admirals here, who’s done an incredible job.  You haven’t slept too much in the last two months either.  Look at him.  (Laughs.)
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  No, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s — somebody said to me, “President, you look tired.”  I said, “I should be tired.”  We should all be tired.  But we have to win, right?
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Tomorrow, the President — the Vice President will lead a call with our nation’s governors from FEMA headquarters, Mike —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  — to review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies.  Working very hard with governors now on testing.  We want to help them out.
Before the call, we’ll send them a full list of all of the large laboratory machines in the states.  They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there, and they’re really high-quality machines, by the way.  And the potential capacity of those machines, if they’re fully utilized — a couple of them didn’t know that they could be utilized in a different manner.  They’re only up to 10 percent, and they can go 90 percent more.
Many governors are still relying on their state laboratories rather than the full and much larger capacity that is available to them.  As an example, commercial laboratories, such as Quest and LabCorp — these are massive laboratories that can handle a lot more than they’re being sent.  A few days ago, it was at 30 percent.  They’re only at 30 percent capacity now.  I don’t know — probably the same, but they have a lot of capacity.
In addition, academic laboratories, big research labs — there’s tremendous capacity out there.  And some of them want the fast — you know, the instant Abbott machine, which just came about due to the research during this little short period of time.  And it’s very quick, but these labs can do them very quickly also, and they’re — they’re massive.  They can handle much more — much more than the machine, the small machine, can handle.
We continue to procure millions of swabs, test collectors.  I have something here.  Just happen to have it.  It’s a swab.  It looks innocent.  Not very complicated.  Anybody like to see what it looks like?  Should I open it?  Does everybody?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-28/

5:09 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Good afternoon.  We continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak.  It’s been very devastating all over the world.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.  Probably more.  That number was as of a week ago.
Dr. Birx will walk through some of these trends in a few moments, but they’re very positive trends for winning.  Going to win.  We’re going to close it out.
While we mourn the tragic loss of life — and you can’t mourn it any stronger than we’re mourning it — the United States has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country, with the possible exception of Germany.  And I think we’re as good or better.
On a per capita basis — remember that: On a per capita basis, our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of Western Europe, with the lone exception of possibly Germany.  This includes the UK, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, France.  Spain, for example, has a mortality rate that is nearly four times that of the United States, but you don’t hear that.  You hear we have more death.  But we’re much bigger countries than any of those countries by far.
So when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the United States is number one — but we’re not number one; China is number one, just so you understand.  China is number one by a lot.  It’s not even close.  They’re way ahead of us in terms of death.  It’s not even close.  You know it.  I know it.  And they know it.  But you don’t want to report it.  Why?  You’ll have to explain that.  Someday I’ll explain it.
Since we released the guidelines to open up America again — and this was two days ago — a number of states, led by both Democrat and Republican governors, have announced concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual, and phased opening.
Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions.  And I can tell you the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he knows what he’s doing.  He’s a great governor.  He knows exactly what he’s doing.
Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.  Ohio, North Dakota, and Idaho have advised non-essential businesses to prepare for a phased opening starting May 1st.
Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken unprecedented actions to rush economic relief to our citizens.  As an example, you don’t hear anymore about ventilators.  What happened to the ventilators?  And now they’re giving you the other; it’s called “testing.”  Testing.  But they don’t want to use all of the capacity that we’ve created.  We have tremendous capacity.  Dr. Birx will be explaining that.  They know that.  The governors know that.  The Democrat governors know that; they’re the ones that are complaining.
Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we’ve already processed nearly $350 billion to 1.6 million small businesses across the nation to keep American workers on the payroll.  So we’re asking the Democrats to get it done.  This should be bipartisan.  This should be 100 percent vote.  And it’s really been incredible.  The $350 billion that’s been approved is so popular, and it’s keeping businesses open.  It’ll be open hopefully forever.
Our swift action is directly supporting 30 million American jobs.  Amy Wright, from North Carolina, as an example, said the program is a “game changer” for her and her family.  It’s coffee shops.  And she has 120 employees, many of whom have developmental and intellectual disabilities.  And now they’re all staying, and they’re getting paid.  And she’s got a dream, and it’s going to take place very quickly when she opens again.  So, Amy, good luck.  North Carolina — great place.
Scott and Julie Alderink helped lead a church and own a restaurant in South Dakota, with about 15 employees.  They were already starting layoffs.  Layoffs were moving along rapidly.  But now they’ve hired their employees back, and they can keep the restaurant open.  And it’ll be moving quickly — very quickly — as opposed to not having anybody and probably not having a place to have all of these people employed.  She would have been out of business.  She would have been done.
The Paycheck Protection Program funding is now fully drained.  It’s out.  It’s gone.  Three hundred and fifty billion dollars to small businesses.  And, in turn, it goes to the employees of those small businesses.
Lawmakers must stop blocking these funds and replenish the program without delay.  The Democrats have to come onboard.  I used to read that these were Democrat programs, not Republican.  It seems to have switched around a lot, hasn’t it?  Huh?  Switched around a lot.  The republicans want it.  I think the Democrats probably do too.
But they also want other things that are unacceptable.  This is about COVID.  This is about the plague and what it’s done to us.  This isn’t about extraneous things that they’ve been trying to get for years and that our country doesn’t want them to have.
As we enter the next stage of our battle, we are continuing our relentless effort to destroy the virus.  My administration is taking steps to protect high-risk communities by providing funding for 13,000 community health center sites and mobile medical stations.
In order to equip them with the most advanced and robust testing capabilities, these sites are incredible.  What they can do is incredible.  The job they do is incredible.  These centers provide care to 28 million people living in medically underserved urban and rural regions, including many African American and Hispanic communities.  We’re taking care of them.  And it’s so important, because you’ve all been reading about the disproportionate numbers on African American, and you’re reading a little bit less about Hispanic, but likewise Hispanic communities.  The numbers are disproportionate.  In fact, we’re doing big studies on it right now.  We don’t like it.  Not right.
Nationwide, we’ve now conducted over 4 million tests, and Deborah will be talking about that.  It’s double the number conducted by any other country on Earth.  So that’s more than two times, actually, the number conducted by any other country on Earth.  You hear so much about testing.  What we’ve done is incredible on testing.  And I started with an obsolete, broken system from a previous administration — or administrations.  But I would really say “administration” for a different reason because testing has become so advanced over the last number of years, and we have the most advanced of all.
I spoke with other nations this morning — the leaders — and they all are talking about our great testing capability, and some of them want to know what to do; what — how can they get involved, because they need it for their own countries.
In Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and other hotspots, we have also tested more people per capita, by far, than Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, and all other major countries.  So think of that.  In New York, for instance, per capita testing is 6 percent higher than in Singapore.  In fact, there’s a typo.  It’s 67 percent higher.  That’s a big difference.
I’d say there’s a big difference between six percent and sixty- — I was looking; I said, 6 percent doesn’t look too good.  It’s 67 percent — good job out there — higher than Singapore; 64 higher than South Korea; and 47 percent higher than Australia.  So it’s 67 percent higher than Singapore, which is a very advanced place in terms of what they’re doing.
My administration has also been speaking frequently with many of the governors to help them find and unlock the vast unused testing capacity that exists in their states.  Dr. Birx discussed yesterday the commercial and academic laboratories, and the states have tremendous unused capability, which they can use.  The governors should use it.  Tremendous unused capability, and they’re waiting for business from these governors that — some of them complain.  I must tell you, for the most part, we’re getting along great with them, but some of them like to complain.
But I still go back because the hardest thing of all, by far, by a factor of 20, is the ventilators.  And now we’re the king of ventilators.  We have ventilators.
We’re going to be helping other countries very soon.  We’re going to be helping Mexico.  I spoke with the President of Mexico.  He’s great.  A great guy.  And I told him we’re going to be helping him.  They desperately, in Mexico, need ventilators, and I told him we’re going to be helping him very substantially.  We’re in a position to do that.  We’re building, now, thousands a week.  And they’re coming in rapidly, and they’re very, very high quality.
But we’re also helping governors to develop strategies to smartly deploy their testing capacity to protect vulnerable and underserved populations, while getting Americans at lower risk safely back to work.
So, again, we have tremendous testing capacity.  Now, a lot of people like the Abbott test that we came up with.  Abbott is a brand-new technology, brand-new test.  It’s great.  It’s five minutes, boom, you put it in.  And we’re making thousands of machines.  Abbott is making thousands and thousands of machines.  But not everybody is going to get that one, but they’re going to get others.  We have numerous platforms which we’ll talk about in a minute.
Unfortunately, some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing, which they shouldn’t be doing, because I inherited broken junk.  Just as they did with ventilators where we had virtually none, and the hospitals were empty.  For the most part, the hospitals didn’t have ventilators.  We had to take care of the whole country, and we did a job, the likes of which nobody — we assembled an army of young, brilliant people.  For the most part, young; a couple of older ones.  But for the most part, they were young, brilliant geniuses that did a job like nobody would believe.  I wish you could have seen it.  Around the clock.
And now the rest of the world is coming to us, asking if we could help them with ventilators because they’re very complicated, very expensive.  They’re very hard to build.  And we have them coming in by the thousands.  But you don’t hear that from even the governors.  Nobody is complaining about ventilators.  And if there was a surge, we could have ventilators to them within hours, because we have in stockpile almost 10,000 ventilators.
You don’t hear about hospital beds.  When I first started, everyone was talking, “Oh, hospitals beds.  Hospitals beds.”   The governor of New York correctly asked me for hospital beds, and we got the Army Corps of Engineers out, and they built them.  He needed them.  I mean, he — we went — I know he said that we were projecting.  We’re not projecting New York.  We’re listening to the governors.  He wanted them.  He needed them.  And we gave him thousands of beds in Javits Center.  We brought the ship.  And then the ship, we had it converted to COVID-19.  And that was a big deal, by the way, because of ventilation and all the things we had to do.  But we did.
And fortunately for him — and for us, all of us — they haven’t used either one very much because the numbers have gone down significantly.  But it was there, and it was built, and it was beautiful.  Two thousand nine hundred beds.  It was incredible what they did.  They did it in a matter of a few days.
But, unfortunately — and it was very good; the relationship was very good.  And I’m, frankly, glad they don’t need them, but they were there.  Louisiana, the same thing.  I think the governor — a Democrat, good guy — and he will, I think, tell you a story that we had more than enough, and I said, “Well, we’re supposed to build one more.”  I called him and I said, “You know, if we don’t have to build this hospital” — it was an additional anywhere from 500 to 1,000 beds.  “If you don’t need it, would it be possible that we don’t build it?  We’d like to build it someplace else, or not build it at all and save money,” which is okay for government to use it someplace else.  And he called call me back the next day and he said, “Sir, we don’t need it.”  I said, “That’s great that you say that.  I appreciate it.”  And he didn’t need it.
But we were ready to go, and we took good care of Louisiana.  We took good care of Michigan.  We took good care of every place.  We didn’t — we didn’t miss a trick.
And we’re in great shape on testing.  We have different platforms.  We actually have nine different platforms.  And on Monday, we’re going to be adding one; that’ll be 9 to 10.  I don’t like to count on them before they’re up, but we’ll have anywhere from 9 to 10 platforms with a tremendous testing capability.  And people can go, and especially with phase one.
Now, at the same time — just like with ventilators — we’re building now the best ventilators.  Just like with ventilators, our testing is getting better and better.  I took the first test.  The first test was not pleasant.  This was not a pleasant thing.  I said, “You got to be kidding” to the doctor.  “You got to be kidding.”  Up your nose and then we hang a right, and it goes down here.  And then we’ll wiggle it around here, under your eye.  And then we’ll pull it out and we’ll say — I said, “No, that’s — there’s no way that can happen.  Is that the way it goes?  You sure?”  This was a very unpleasant test.
And then I was tested a few weeks later with the new test that just came out, the Abbott, where they just touch your nose, basically.  And they put it in a machine, and literally, a few minutes later, they tell you if you’re fine.  And I was lucky in both cases, because I’ve seen the damage that this does to people.
But we have great tests.  They’ve really gotten better and better and better as we go along.  But we have a tremendous lab capability — laboratory capability all over the country.  And for some reason, the governors, they’re not — a lot of them are, but some of the governors like to complain, and they’re not using it.  We have tremendous capability.  We’re ready for them.
And, as we go along, just like with ventilators, we’ll get better, more advanced, and, you know, it’ll be — we’ll be able to do things that nobody would have even believed possible.  But we started off with a broken system.  We inherited a broken, terrible system.
And I always say it: Our cupboards were bare.  We had very little in our stockpile.  Now we’re loaded up.  And we also loaded up these hospitals.  And, you know, we’re talking about payment.  We gave billions of dollars’ worth of things to hospitals, and we’ll have to work that out at some point.  In fact, I guess they’re going to be working that out with Congress.
But we loaded up hospitals.  The federal government loaded up hospitals with things to take care of people that are very desperately — we’re not — we weren’t worried about payment at that time.  We said, “You’ll take care of it at the right time.”
But we gave billions and billions and billions of dollars’ worth of medical goods and medicines and equipment to hospitals.  And we’ll — we’ll work it out with them.  But people don’t like to talk about that.
So we have done a job that nobody believed — this was a military and private enterprises march.  We marched — and, unfortunately, with the other side, because they’re viewing it as an election.  “How did President Trump do?”  “Oh, he did, uh, terribly.  Let’s see.  He did — uh, yeah, he did terribly.”  “Oh.”  But we just got them the ventilators that they didn’t have, that they should have had.  We just got them hospital beds by the thousands.  We just got them testing that they don’t even know how to use.  In some cases, they have machines that they’re only using 5 percent and 10 percent of the machine, because they have an advanced machine and they don’t know how to use it.  It can use — it can do much more.  So we’ve had people explain how to use it.
So, I don’t know, I don’t think I do that on the other side.  I don’t — I really don’t.  I think that here we have a crisis that we have to work together, and I hope we’re going to work together.  But we’re moving along, and we’re moving along well.  We’re moving along well.
This should not be a partisan witch hunt — you know? — like the Russia hunt that turned out to be a total phony deal.  Unfortunately, some of these voices, though, are attempting to — to bring this into politics.  And whether it’s testing or ventilators or hospital beds, or other dimensions of our sweeping public health response — we have had a sweeping response.
In speaking to the leaders of other countries this morning, they said, “This is incredible the way you’ve done this so quickly.”  You know, we’re only talking about a few weeks since everybody knew this was such a big problem.  And the rest of the world is watching, and they respect what we’ve done because I don’t think anybody else — I know nobody else could have done what we’ve done.  And we started with garbage.
As our experts said yesterday, America’s testing capability and capacity is fully sufficient to begin opening up the country, totally.  Indeed, our system is by far the most robust and advanced anywhere in the world, by far.  The rest of the world will tell you that.
I spoke this morning to a friend of mine, President Moon of South Korea.  He just won the election.  He won it by a lot.  He had a big victory, which I was happy about.  And he was saying what a great job we’ve done in this country.  I told him the same thing.  He said what a great job we’ve done here in this country.  So I appreciated that.  He had a great — by the way, he had a great victory and we’re very happy about that, from the standpoint of our country.  We’re working very well with them — South Korea.
As we approach — and the approach that we use — but as we approach, hopefully, the downward side of what’s going on, I think you’re going to see some incredible hard facts and evidence that what we did was right.  There’s a lot of talk about herd — the word “herd.”  I don’t want to show you charts of people that went a different way, but it’s scary.  It’s scary.
We would have had, I think, millions of people die had we done a different way.  And I think numbers are just coming out where they’re estimating 60,000 people will die.  That’s horrible.  I always say one person is too much, especially in this case, when it could have been stopped in China.  It could have been stopped in China, before it started, and it wasn’t.  And the whole world is suffering because of it.
But this herd concept — and everybody had to think of it at the beginning, because, look — look at us: We had the greatest economy in the history of the world.  Better than China; better than any country in the world; better than any country has ever had.  We had the highest stock market in history, by far.  And I’m honored by the fact that it has started to go up very substantially.  That’s because the market is smart.  The market is actually brilliant.  I’ve seen it.  And they’re viewing it like we’ve done a good job.  They view it that way.
Because if you would have told me that we’re at 24,000 or beyond, and the highest we were ever was — we never hit 30.  We were getting close to 30, so let’s say around 29,000.  We’re at 24.  If we were heading down, I would start to say, “Oh, wow, we may be heading into territory where I started.”  I didn’t like that.  Now we’re way up.  But if you would have said to me with what we’ve gone through — not caused by our country or our people or any — I mean, not caused by certainly anybody within our country.  But if you would have said that, after going through this horrible plague, that we’d have a stock market that’s much, much higher than when I started, much higher than where I started — and I think it’s — you know, I think we have tremendous momentum.  We have a big election coming up, but I think we have tremendous momentum.
First, we get rid of the plague.  And because of what we’re doing with the PPP, what we’re doing with the Paycheck, as we call it, I think we have a chance to have these companies get back to action quickly.
But our approach to testing is based on facts, data, and very hard evidence, not partisan agendas or coordinated political talking points.
Mike Pence, who’s a phenomenal guy, he’s making the commencement address right now at the Air Force Academy, where they’re being very politically correct.  Everyone is standing not 6 feet but 10 feet apart.  Okay?  And it’s very different.  I made that speech last year.  I’m going to West Point.  I think they’re changing the date to June 13th because of what’s going on in New York.  They’re moving into June 13th.  West Point.
So I’m doing their commencement speech, and they’re going to have — it’s sad because — but it’s a big start — they’re going to have the cadets.  They may not have the parents, but they’re going to have the cadets.  The parents are so proud of them.  I know at the Air Force Academy, where Mike is speaking right now, they don’t have the parents; they have the cadets.  They’re very, very widespread.
And you talk about social distancing — I mean, they are really spread.  I looked at it.  They using 10 feet.  So he’s — he’s doing that.  But they’re having it.  It’s very important to have it.  And that’s a great thing.  That’s a great thing.  That’s a big start.
So he’s there right now.  And I will tell you, they — he’s a gentleman, Mike Pence.  A real gentleman.  And they requested — the Democrat senators requested a phone call with him yesterday.  And I think they had, for the most part, all of them on — like, approximately 47.  I heard it was just about all of them, whatever it might be.  I don’t want to be wrong by 1 or 2 or 10 and have the press say, “He lied.  He told a lie.  Terrible, terrible.”  Whatever it was.  But they have 47, and I guess most of them were on.
I heard they were so rude.  I used a term today — I said, rude and nasty.  But I heard they were so rude.  No matter what he said, which was all very positive in terms of winning this battle against the invisible enemy — no matter what he said, they were fresh.  They were nasty.
And it was, I heard, just a terrible thing.  And I said, “Mike, that’s politics.  That’s what it is.”  If we came into this room today and said, “The battle is over.  We have won.  It’s 100 percent gone.”  The Democrats would say, “The President has done a horrible job.  He has done a disgraceful job.  It is a shame how bad he is.”
You know, it’s — it’s — this is the talking points; this is political.  And it would be nice not to have that, especially when we’ve done the job we’ve done.  I mean, all you have to do is look at the big — the big “V” for victory or “V” for ventilator.  Take a look at it.  Everybody said they had us on that; they had us.  They thought they had us, but we got them done at numbers that nobody would have believed.
And we did use our Act, our Production Act, and we used it.  But didn’t use it — we didn’t need it like a hammer.  All we had to do — for the most part — we used it, actually, in a number of cases.  But for the most part, all we had to do is talk about it.  All we had to do is say, “We’re going to use it if you don’t do this.”  And everybody was, you know, for the most part, good.  We used it a couple of times because it didn’t work out the easy way, but it worked out the hard way.
But whether it was masks or ventilator, it was incredible what we’ve been able to do.  So this is a very critical time for the American people, and the American people deserve real information, and responsible and thoughtful dialogue from their elected leaders and from the media.
The media has been — some very honest, but some very dishonest.  You know that.  You know that.  I mean, I even read a story where Mark Meadows — a tough guy — he was crying; he was crying.  This was a Maggie Haberman.  You know, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of Russia, but she was wrong on Russia.  So was everyone else.  They should all give back their Pulitzer Prizes.
In fact, it turned out that the crime was committed by the other side.  The crime was not committed by this side; it was committed by the other side — a bunch of bad people.  You saw the reports coming out over the last two weeks.  They got caught.  So Maggie Haberman gets a Pulitzer Prize?  She’s a third-rate reporter.  New York Times.
And we put her name up here last week.  You saw that.  People thought it was a commercial.  It wasn’t a commercial.  It was like a commercial, but it wasn’t a commercial.  It was just clips.  And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said Mark Meadows was crying.  And they made it sound — I said, “Mark” — and it’s okay if he did.  I wouldn’t — you know, look.  But I think he was crying probably — really, for the wrong reason they had it down.  But he’s not a crier.  And if he was — I know criers.  I could tell you people that you know that are very famous.  They cry, and that’s okay too.
But it was a nasty story in so many ways.  It was fake news.  And she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter.  She is.  I’ve known her for a long while.  I haven’t spoken to her in a long time.  I made the mistake: I take a picture with her at the desk, a long time ago.  Every time she does a story, if I say — I haven’t spoken to her in long — many, many, many months, maybe years.  I don’t speak to her.  She’s fake.  A lot of people are fake.  A lot of people  We got a lot of fake people.
But what happens is she writes this story as retribution.  Puts it in the New York Times.  And the New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper.  It’s my opinion.  It’s not an opinion.  It’s actually, from my standpoint — you know, the very hard thing to figure, though: Most people wouldn’t know that, but I know it because I know the facts.
And they make up — I said it today; they make up words.  “Sources say…” Most often used: “Sources say…”  You know what “sources say” means?  “Sources say” means they have nobody.  And they make it up.  Okay?
And they have a few other type statements that mean the same thing.  But “sources say” is the most often-used express- — in the Washington Post; New York Times, especially; CNN — fake news.  CNN.
They should really be mandated, and I mean mandated to use a name.  If there’s a source, use a name.  Say that Kayleigh — “Kayleigh McEnany said…” or somebody.  And you’d find out that the — number one, the source wouldn’t say it.  The sources don’t exist.  I don’t believe the sources exist.
And I try and tell this — you know, the beautiful thing about doing these conferences is that we have tremendous numbers of viewers, and I’m able to reach the viewers without having to go through fake news, where they make a good story into a bad story.
So, with all of that, it’s been an incredible period of time.  We’ve done a fantastic job.  We’re the talk of other nations.  The leaders of other nations are calling us for help.  They’re calling us for equipment.  They’re calling us for testing capacities.
Now, with the testing, we are going further.  Deborah is going to talk about that now.  With the testing, we have some other tests coming up that are going to be, I think, phenomenal.  I think they’re going to blow away everything as soon as they come out, and we’re going to get them out as soon as possible.
But I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words about where we’ve come, how far we’ve come, and more importantly, where we’re going from this point.  Because honestly, it’s — it’s quite amazing.  Thank you very much.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  If we could have the first slide.
I wanted to give you an update on where we are as states and as counties and as cities.  I know you all are watching carefully.  The numbers have shifted over the last few days.  What happens when nations — when states change the reporting from “confirmed” to “probable”?  So now all probable cases are included.  They had to add them back in.  Even though the cases may have been from March, they were added over 14, 15, and 16th of April, and states may continue to be adding them.  Eventually, we’re hoping that those get accounted for on the day when the presumptive cases or the probable cases were counted.  But right now, they’re added in, in one fell swoop.
So this is New York and New Jersey, and I think we all know how difficult and what a difficult time both New York and New Jersey have had.  I call your attention to the axis; it goes up to 250,000 cases.  So you can get a frame of how we’re talking about some of the other metro areas.
Next slide.
This is the 25 metro areas — the top 25 metro areas.  And you can only see the New York metro area in this slide.  Again, the axis goes up to about 300,000.  It includes the New Jersey part of the metro area, as well as part of southern Connecticut.
Next slide.
But if I take New York out — and the reason I wanted to do that — now the axis is one-tenth of the previous axis.  So that previous ax- — the previous slide, 300,000.  This slide, 30,000.  So that will give you a frame of reference for some of these other metros.
The reason I wanted to show you this is this is cumulative cases.  And we are still tracking, very closely, the issues in Chicago and Boston.  But on this slide, I hope you can see the yellow line; that is Detroit.  And Detroit and this mayor of Detroit has really done an extraordinary job, and the people of Detroit have done an extraordinary job with their social distancing.
The other line I want to call your attention to is the line here.  This is New Orleans.  And I think — frankly, I was concerned about New Orleans because they had a lot of preexisting comorbidities.  They only — they have two or three major hospitals, but a large cover, a very large area of geographic area.
And that other blue line that you can see — it’s down right here — that’s the Seattle line.  And you can see that their response, because of the nursing home alert, they were one of the first states and the first metro areas to really move to social distancing.  And so they’ve really never had a peak, like many of the other metros.
Next slide.
Then I just want to take you through some of these new case graphics.  That was cumulative cases.  This is daily cases.  And obviously, there’s a lot of variability, and variability in reporting, but you get a sense over time, when you look at daily cases.
So New Orleans is on the — on panel on your left, and Baton Rouge on your right.  But you can see clearly, New Orleans, about a month ago, very low levels, probably less than 50 cases.  Large peak and spike around the beginning of April.  And they have come down, and they have it down to very few cases.  Again, I showed you before how both their syndromic cases have come down, as well as their actual case — number of cases.
Next slide.
This is Seattle.  So you can see they had a much lower peak.  And this is — when we talked about flattening the curve, this is what flattening the curve looks like.  It becomes a longer, slower decline, but it ever gets very high, and then goes back down.
Next slide.
And then this is Detroit.  And we always look at the metros as a consolidated.  So this is both Wayne and Oakland in Michigan.  And we really want to thank the mayor for the incredible job that they have done to really ensure that everyone is receiving the adequate healthcare and testing, and they’ve done quite a good job with testing in Michigan.
But all of these states — Louisiana and New York have tested 30,000 per million inhabitants.  Those are some of our highest numbers across the board.
And next slide.
And so the President talked about the case fatality rates, and we really — we’ve lost a lot of Americans to this disease, and we pray and hope for each one of them that are in the hospitals and the excellent care.
What this graph illustrates is the amazing work of the American people to really adhere to social distancing.  This was some — this was nothing we had ever attempted to do as a nation, and the world hadn’t attempted to do.  But they were able to decrease the number of cases so that, in general, most of the metro areas never had an issue of complete crisis care of all of their hospitals in the region.
And so you can see our case fatality rate is about half to a third of many of the other countries.
THE PRESIDENT:  And, excuse me, does anybody really believe this number?  Does anybody really believe this number?
DR. BIRX:  I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this could be.  When highly developed healthcare delivery systems — the United Kingdom and France and Belgium and Italy and Spain — with extraordinary doctors and nurses and equipment have case fatality rates in the 20s, up to 45, and Belgium’s extraordinarily competent healthcare delivery system, and then China at .33, you realize that these numbers, even — and this includes the doubled number out of Wuhan.
And so I wanted, really, to put it in perspective, but I wanted you also to see how great the care has been for every American that has been hospitalized and how extraordinary work of our doctors and nurses in our laboratorians on the front line who have been doing an excellent job.
Next slide.
And then we also wanted to show —
THE PRESIDENT:  If I might add, though, also —
DR. BIRX:  Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT:  — the number for Iran.  Does anybody really believe that number?  You see what’s going on over there.  Does anybody — put that slide back, if you would.  Does anybody believe this number?  Does anybody believe this number?  You saw more bags —
DR. BIRX:  And this is why —
THE PRESIDENT:  — on television than that.
DR. BIRX:  This is why the reporting is so important.  And I think you remember, almost six weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was telling you what Italy was showing to us and what France was telling to us, and the warnings that they gave to us and said, “Be very careful.  There’s an extraordinary high mortality among people with preexisting conditions.”  And we used their information to bring that to the American people.
That came — that alert — that alert, before we even had significant cases, came from our European colleagues on the front line.  And that’s why we keep coming back to how important, in a pandemic and a new disease, it’s really critical to have that level of transparency because it changes how we work as a nation.  It allowed us on — over March 15 to make an alert out there about vulnerable individuals and the — really, they need to protect them, and my call-out to millennials to really protect their parents, protect their grandparents, and get that information out to everyone that there were preexisting conditions that put people at greater risk.  That information came from our European colleagues who were in the midst of their battle themselves.
And so there is never an excuse to not share information.  When you are the first country to have an outbreak, you really have a moral obligation to the world to not only talk about it, but provide that information that’s critical to the rest of the world to really respond to this credibly.
And I really want to thank our European colleagues who have worked so hard to get us that information, even in the midst of their own tragedies.  And I think that really shows how important transparency is.
And we go to the next slide.
We can show you this really encouraging and great news: So we know that fatalities will continue to lag because people are in hospitals still, and some are still sit in intensive care units.
But these COVID-like illnesses — this is our hospitalizations that are related to flu per 100,000 Americans.  This is this year’s flu season.  And you can see our COVID-like illnesses.  And this is all of them, probable and confirmed cases.  Our hospitalizations are declining.
Now, I showed you metros that have made tremendous progress, and we’ve been up here many times talking about it being 6, 10, 15 additional cities.  And now we’re really just focused on Chicago and Boston and Massachusetts, and really some issues that Providence is starting to improve now.  So their relationship to the two large outbreak cities.  But this is really reassuring to us, the progress we’re making across the country against this disease.
And I’m — just really want to conclude by thanking again the American people for making these type of graphics possible; thank the data team who puts these together for me.  So they are working until about 3:30 every morning to make sure that we have the most up-to-date information.  That’s the data that goes to our supply-chain individuals to ensure that every hospital in every state and every community has what they need based on data, and to make sure that we’re serving the needs of the American people as effectively as possible.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.  Fantastic job.  Is this yours?
DR. BIRX:  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
The fact is that we’ve been learning a lot from Deborah and Tony and so many of the professionals, the director.
PEPFAR: We’re spending — the United States, without help, to the best of my knowledge — mostly in Africa, $6 billion a year.  And that’s on AIDS.  What we’ve done for AIDS in Africa is unbelievable.  We spend $6 billion a year.  That’s been going on for a long time.  Nobody knows that; you’ve never heard that.  I’ve never heard that.  Six billion dollars a year.
Millions of people are living right now, and living very comfortably, because of the fact that we have found the answer to that horrible, horrible plague.  That was a plague.
But we spent $6 billion a year.  And from what I hear, it’s very well spent, done by professionals, including this great professional right here.  That was the thing that you worked hardest on and something that was very close to her heart.  So it’s — you know, it’s something that I think people should start hearing.
The World Health Organization: We’re just finding more and more problems.  And we spend this money really well.  There are other ways we can spend the $500 million.  That’s $500 million; this is $6 billion.  But we can find other ways to spend it where people are going to be helped, we think, in a much greater — in a much greater way.
We’re doing some research on certain people that take a lot of credit for what they do.  And NIH is giving away a lot of money — a lot of money.  We’d give away for years — for many years, they’d give away a lot of money.  And some people complain and some people don’t.  Some people are extremely happy.  So we’re looking into that also.
They’re giving away approximately, as I understand it, recently, more than $32 billion a year.  Thirty-two billion.  And so we’ve been looking at that for a while, and we’re going to be having some statements to be made about that.  Thirty-two billion dollars a year.  It’s a lot of money, and we want to make sure it’s being spent wisely.  And we’ve been doing that, by the way, and we’ll have some statements on that.
And those are much bigger numbers then what we’re talking about with national — if you — if you look, with the — with our friends from wherever they come from.  You know, 500 — 500 million is a lot of money, but it’s not a lot compared to the kind of money that we give out.  I think, over the years, it’s been averaging about 32 billion dollars.  Thirty-two billion.  So we’ve had our eye on that one for a while.
We also talked about the lab in China where, I guess, $3.7 million was given some time ago.  And we’re looking at that very closely.  Chief of Staff has that pretty much under control.  But it’s money that — too bad it got spent there.  But that was spent — what year was that, Mark?  That was four or five years ago?
MR. MEADOWS:  That was over the last six years.  Yes.
THE PRESIDENT:  Six years ago, approximately.  So we’re looking at that.  And that’s the lab that people are talking about.
All right, so we’re looking at a lot of things.  There’s tremendous waste in our government.  We found it in many different ways and in many different forms.  And this is one of them.  This is one of them.
We can spend — I was talking to Dr. Birx — we can spend $500 million using all of it in a much more efficient manner if we’re — if we choose to do that.  And it’ll be to the good of many more people than are getting it right now.
But you look at the mistakes that were made — I mean, so late, long after I said we have to close off our country.  They were actually against our closing off our country to China.  When I did that in January, they were against that.  They didn’t like the idea of closing off our country.  They said it was a bad thing to do, actually, and they’ve since taken that back.  But it was a very lucky thing that we did it.  Very lucky.  We would have had numbers that were very significantly greater.  Tony Fauci said that.  He said it would have been very significantly greater had we not done that.
So we’ve made a lot of moves that were good moves, but it’s still a very depressing subject because it’s a lot of death.  And if it was stopped very early on at the source, before it started blowing into these proportions, you have 184 countries that would have been in a lot better shape.  But our country is getting back, and I expect that we’re going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before.
All right, we’ll take a few questions.  Jeff.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-2/

6:22 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I just had a great conversation with the leading faith leaders of our country.  It went extremely well.  We learned a lot.  I learned a lot.  And we’re working on some things that are very interesting and very positive.  I thank them all for being on the call.
And yesterday, we unveiled detailed guidelines for America’s governors to initiate a phased, safe, and gradual reopening of America.  That’s what’s happening.  The guidelines provide governors with the fact-driven and science-based metrics they will need to make the decisions that are right for their own particular state.
To view the guidelines, you can go to the website at Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica.  So that’s Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica.
Treasury has sent out economic relief payments to more than 80 million Americans who have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS.  And an incredible success it has been.  If you have not received your check, please visit IRS.gov/GetMyPayment.  How about that one?  IRS.gov/GetMyPayment.  That way, the IRS can get you your payment in days — and they’ve done a fantastic job, I have to say — and you won’t have to wait for a check in the mail.
I have some very good news: We sent out 80 million deposits, and less than 1 percent had even little problems.  A couple had minor glitches, but it’s substantially less than 1 percent.  So out of 80 million deposits, less than 1 percent.  And that gets corrected immediately.  So just please do as I say.  You’ll get that very quickly, very easily.
Today, I’m also announcing that Secretary Perdue — who happens to be right next to me; handsome man — and the Department of Agriculture will be implementing a 19-billion-dollar relief program for our great farmers and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic.  Very honored to be doing this.  Our farmers, ranchers — we have — these are great people, great Americans.  Never complain.  They never complain.  They just do what they have to do.
The program will include direct payments to farmers as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat, and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need.
The USDA will receive another $14 billion in July that will have funding to continue help our — helping.  And this will help our farmers and our ranchers, and it’s money well deserved.  So not only were they targeted at one point by China — and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening.  And they never complained, but that worked out very well.  Twelve billion dollars they got, and sixteen billion dollars they got.  And now it’s $19 billion.
And I’m just going to ask Secretary Perdue to explain
exactly how we’re going to handle it.  Thank you.
SECRETARY PERDUE:  Well, Mr. President, you may remember earlier this year, you tweeted a message to our farmers and ranchers that, no matter their circumstances, you pledged to stand behind them.  And while none of us could ever have anticipated this type of pandemic that we’re currently in, I think today’s announcement is proof that you’ve put our — you have our farmers’ backs and that you will continue to do what it takes to support them.  And they are very grateful.
We’ve heard a lot recently — all of you — about our food supply chain.  I think America now knows that, more than ever, the wholesome food that our families depend upon, it starts with America’s farmers and ranchers.  America agriculture has been hard hit, like most of America, with the coronavirus, and President Trump is standing with our farmers and all Americans to make sure we all get through this national emergency.
So today, thanks to your direction and leadership, Mr. President, USDA is announcing the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.  As you mentioned, this new 19-billion-dollar program will take several immediate actions to assist farmers, ranchers, and consumers in response to the COVID-19 national emergency.
The program is really divided into two parts.  One is a direct payment — $16 billion in direct payments to farmers, ranchers, and producers who have experienced unprecedented losses during this pandemic.
Since we wanted to get the payments out to producers as quickly as possible, we decided to use the funds in the CCC — the current funds of 6.5 million — billion dollars, combined with the 19.5 of COVID money, rather than wait for the replenishment of the CCC funds in July.  Based on industry estimates of damage, Mr. President, it is becoming apparent that we’ll need the additional CCC funds as we continue to track the economic losses.
Secondly — and this is really important as well — the USDA will be purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat products to be distributed to Americans in need through our food bank networks, as well as other community and faith-based organizations.  Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking, as well, to those who produce them.
This program will not only provide direct financial relief to our farmers and ranchers, Mr. President, who will allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance in this country to help our fellow Americans in need.
So in recent weeks, we’ve seen — all of us seen the heroic patriotism of our food supply-chain workers, and they’ve shown, day in and day out, doing the work to serve the needs of fellow Americans.
Our farmers have been in the fields planting and doing what they do every spring to feed the American people, even with a pandemic, as we speak.
I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your unwavering support.  They want to thank you for your unwavering support for America’s farmers and ranchers.  And I want to commit to you, Mr. President, and to the American people that USDA will do everything in our power to implement this program as quickly and as efficiently as possible to help our farmers, ranchers, producers, and consumers during this great time of need.
So thank you very much for having me here today.  And God bless you.  God bless America.  God bless American agriculture.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, Sonny.  Fantastic job.  Thank you, Sonny.
So, our great Secretary of Agriculture was the governor of Georgia for eight years, and the only reason he isn’t still there, frankly, is that he was term limited.  And I said, “Let’s get him for agriculture.”  And you’ve done a fantastic job.  We want to thank you very much.  Eight years at Georgia.  We really appreciate it.  Great job.
Even as we prepare to rebuild our economy, America continues to wage an all-out medical war to defeat the invisible enemy.  To date, we have conducted more than 3.78 million coronavirus tests — by far, the most of any country; it’s not even close.  In the hardest-hit areas, such as New York and Louisiana, we’ve also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country.
The United States has the most robust, advanced, and accurate testing system anywhere in the world.  As of yesterday, we have distributed nearly 660,000 Abbott IDs.  Now, that’s a — an incredible test.  It’s called the ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic test.  And it’s fantastic.  It’s a hot — it’s the hot one.  The problem with this business is it’s the hot one until about two days from now, because we do have a saliva test that just came out, and that can be self-administered, and it’s said to be fantastic.
I want to thank Abbott Laboratories.  They have been incredible.  I want to thank Roche.  They’ve likewise been incredible.
Over the last several days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests conducted by hospitals and academic institutions, which have now performed nearly 600,000 tests.  There is a tremendous amount of unused capacity in the states available for governors to tap.  We have tremendous unused capability within those laboratories, and I hope the governors are going to be able to use them.  The governors are responsible for testing, and I hope they’re going to be able to use this tremendous amount of available capacity that we have.
It’s up to 1 million additional tests per week — when you think of that.  In the next few weeks, we’ll be sending out 5.5 million testing swabs to the states.  Swabs can be done easily by the governors themselves.  Mostly, it’s cotton.  It’s not a big deal.  You can get cotton easily.  But if they can’t get it, we will take care of it.
Yesterday, the FDA announced a new collaboration with United Health Group, the Gates Foundation, Quantigen, and U.S. Cotton to greatly expand the supply of essential swabs, including a new polyester Q-tip-type swab for the coronavirus testing.  All of these actions will help our testing capability continue to grow dramatically.
So we’re helping people, even with swabs.  We get ventilators.  We’re now the king of ventilators.  We have hundreds of thousands under construction.  We don’t need them ourselves.  The governors are in great shape.  If we do, we have a great stockpile that we’ll immediately send to the state in need.  But we’ve handled that situation incredibly well.  I hope people understand it.  I wish the media would get the word out.  What we’ve done in ventilators is amazing, because they’re big, expensive, and highly complex.
We’re speaking to other countries.  I spoke to the President of Mexico today — a great gentleman — and I told him that we are going to be helping him out with ventilators, helping Mexico out.  And we’ll be helping some other countries too.  We have a lot of very high-level, high-quality ventilators.  And they’re here, and they’re also being manufactured as we speak.
Following the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and in politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity — it’s totally false and misleading — demonstrating a complete failure to understand the enormous scope of the testing capabilities that we’ve brought online.  And we started, really, from ground zero.  We started from really being very, very outdated and obsolete as a country, from the past.
And I will say this: If they didn’t understand it, it’s just really — unfortunately, I hate to say this because we’ve been getting along very well, but it would be false reporting, because they understand the capability.  And it’s going to be up to the states to use that capability.  The states have local points where they can go — a governor can call the mayors, and the mayors can call representatives, and everybody — everything is perfect.  And that’s the way it should work and always should work.
We’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing.  We have to get even better.  And some people think a little bit differently.  There are areas where you have vast amounts of area where you have very few people and almost no people are infected.  And those places will be looked upon differently by different governors.  And I think you’re going to have a lot of news coming out about that over the next few days.  I think certain states are going to come online, and they’re going to start the early stages of the puzzle that we’re putting together.  And it’s going to be together sooner rather than later.  A lot of really incredible things are happening.
And at some point in the not-too-distant future, we’re going to have our country back.  And it’s going to be, I think, really — with what we’re doing on stimulus, and helping people keep their businesses together and their lives together and their jobs, it’s going to be better than ever before.  I hope so.  I really do.
The current conversation is reminiscent of what happened on ventilators — you remember that — when requests were made far beyond what was objectively needed.  We were hearing from a certain state and we were hearing from a lot that they needed far more ventilators.  In one case, they wanted 40,000 ventilators — 40,000.  It turned out that they had plenty and they had a number of about 7- or 8,000, and that was plenty.  We supplied them with a lot.  But that was the right number; we got it just about right.  And if they did need more, we’re ready to give more, but I think the surge seems to be over.
And there are a lot of governors just doing a great job.  And they’re working with us, but we’re all working together.
The research and development that we’ve done at the federal level has been absolutely incredible.  The media will be accepting of these figures when they get to see the end result.  I think they’re going to see it and I think they’re already seeing it.  That includes not only ventilators, but beds.  We’ve built, in most cases, far more than they even needed, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.
This is what the governors wanted.  They wanted a certain amount in Louisiana.  I spoke with the governor; I had a long talk with him.  And I said, “Do you think you’ll need that final hospital?”  And they actually didn’t need it.  We built a lot of — a lot of beds.  So, I appreciate it, from the governor.
And we saved — building a hospital in New York, we did a — I think, just a spectacular job at the Javits Center.  And even sending the ship up became — we brought it into COVID, but they didn’t — they didn’t really need it.  It didn’t get much use, but it was there and ready.  It wasn’t supposed to be used for that purpose; we changed it into that purpose.  And it was there — ready, willing, and able.  Same with Javits, but they didn’t quite need the rooms that we — the beds that we — we produced.
So we produced almost 2,900 beds, and I think I’d rather tell you that we were over-prepared that we were — than we were underprepared.  And that was a good-faith effort by New York, I have to say that.  A very good faith effort.  But it’s nice that we didn’t need that, instead of needing it.  It was not very occupied, but it was ready to go.  It’s still there should something happen, but I think they have it under very good control.
As you’ll hear from our experts today, we’ve already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide for states to begin their reopenings.  And I think you’ll be hearing a lot about reopenings in the coming weeks and months.  Most excitingly, in the coming weeks, I think you’re going to see some very, very dramatic steps taken and very safely.  We’re putting safety first.  We may be opening, but we’re putting safety first.
And when you look at the numbers, when you look at the possible number of death — deaths at 2.2 million people — and it could have very well been that.  It could have been more.  Frankly, I’ve been looking at numbers where it could have been higher than that — 2.2 million people dying.  If you figure we lost 500,000, maybe 600,000 in the Civil War.  2.2 million people.
A minimum, if we did nothing, would have been 1.6 [million].  If you cut that in half, you’re talking about 800,000, 900,000, a million people dying.  But we did a lot of work, and the people of this country were incredible, I have to say.  And I think we’re heading to the other category, and that would be if we did work and if it was successful, they had between 100,000 and 220,000 to 240,000 on the upside.  And I think we’ll be substantially, hopefully, below the hundred number.  And I think, right now, we’re heading at probably around 60-, maybe 65,000.
And one is too many.  I always say it: One is too many.  This is a horrible thing that happened to our country.  This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries all over the world.  This is a horrible thing, and there was no reason for it.  It should never, ever happen again.
In a few minutes, you’ll be hearing from Dr. Redfield, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, and Admiral Giroir to explain these facts in — in really great detail.
Earlier this week, the FDA authorized two new antibody tests — which is very exciting — that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the virus, bringing the total to four authorized antibody tests already.  This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity.
Ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America’s scientific brilliance.  There is nothing like us.  There is nobody like us.  Not even close.  I wish I could tell you stories — what other countries, even powerful countries, say to me — the leaders.  They say it quietly and they say it off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do.
And our country is at a point — a few weeks ago, think of it — four or five weeks ago, we were at a level that nobody had ever attained: the best job numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had.  Every company virtually was doing better business than ever before.  The stock market was at all-time highs.
And then one day, they said, “You got to close it up.”  And we did the right thing.  We saved maybe millions of lives by doing it the way we did it.  But we’re paying a price, but that price is very unimportant compared to the number of lives we’re talking about.
The NIH and others are conducting clinical trials of 35 different therapies and treatments — therapies being so exciting to me, because that’s really like — if something happens, you’re going to get better reasonably quickly and without such a horrible deal, as some people have to go through.
To that end, today NIH announced that it is launching a public-private partnership with more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies.  They’re — HHS, FDA, CDC, and the European Medicines Agency, they’re all working together.  We’re working together with a lot of other countries.
The partnership will marshal and coordinate the vast resources, knowledge, assets, and authorities of more than a dozen organizations and agencies to accelerate development of the most promising therapies and vaccines.  The vaccines are coming along really, really well.  Johnson & Johnson is very well advanced.
One thing is they have to — we’re having great, great success, but we have to test them and it takes a long period of time.  It takes probably over a year, unfortunately.  But therapies likewise are coming along very, very well.  Therapies are immediate.  When we get that, that’ll be a big day.
We’re also equipping our medical warriors on the frontlines.  In total, we have the Project Air Bridge — and the air bridge has been incredible; the National Strategic Stockpile; and every other channel the federal government has deployed.  If you think about this: 44.5 million N95 masks, nearly 524 million gloves, 63.5 million surgical masks, and more than 10 million gowns.  And we have 500 million masks coming in very soon, between manufacturing and orders — 500 million masks.
The last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of our nation.  This invisible enemy is tough and it’s smart and it’s vicious.  But every day, we’re getting closer to the future that we all have been waiting for.  I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel; we are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel.
And it’s happening, and I want to thank everybody in the room.  I want to thank — I actually want to thank some of the media.  We’ve had some fair coverage — some really fair coverage — and I appreciate it.
What I’m going to do is I’m going to introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence, and he’s going to take over for a little while.  I’m going to leave and I’m coming right back, and we’ll take some questions.  They’re going to go over our tremendous testing capabilities.  And again, I’ll be right back.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President, and good afternoon all.
Today, as the President just reflected, it remains a challenging time in the life of our nation.  But because of the extraordinary efforts of the American people, because of the strong partnership the federal government has forged with states across the country, we’re making progress, America.
Despite the — the tragic loss of more than 36,000 Americans, according to our best data reporting this morning, we continue to see new cases low and steady on the West Coast.  And we continue to see cases and hospitalizations declining in the Greater New York City area, in New Orleans, and Detroit, and elsewhere.
This is a tribute, first and foremost, to our — our healthcare doctors, nurses — all of those working on the frontlines.  But it’s also a great tribute to the American people, who have put into practice the social distancing, the guidelines, the guidance of state and local officials.  And we — we hope that every American is encouraged by the steady progress that we are making.
We’re continuing to bring, at the President’s direction, the full resources of the federal government to bear.  Today, the President approved a major disaster declaration for American Samoa, and now all 50 states and all territories are under major disaster declarations for the first time in American history.
At this present moment, 33,000 National Guardsmen are on duty; 5,500 active duty military personnel have been deployed to 9 states, including 716 medical professionals, doctors, and nurses who deployed out to 14 different hospitals today.  Among those were 10 hospitals in New York City.  And military personnel were also serving today in hospitals in Connecticut, Texas, Louisiana, and New Jersey.
Yesterday, as the President reflected, we unveiled the President’s Guidelines for Opening up America Again.  There were two parts at the beginning of those guidelines.  First, the criteria that we hope will guide governors in their decisions about reopening their states on either a statewide level or a county level.  And then also, we outlined what we believe would be the most important state responsibilities to have in place before moving into a reopening plan.
For phase one, the President’s guidelines, you’ll recall it advised that states that have a downward trajectory in cases over a 14-day period of time and ensure that they have proper capacity in their healthcare facilities could move to phase one with the easing of some of the social distancing and the criteria that have been in place.
But for states that meet the criteria, we outlined specific responsibilities protecting workers in critical industries, particularly protecting the most vulnerable, those who live and work in senior care facilities.  And we also encouraged states to have a plan for testing symptomatic individuals and ensuring testing to our most vulnerable populations.
As the President has made clear, governors will decide the time and manner that their states reopen, and we will look to support them in that effort.  But as we assured the American people yesterday, at the President’s direction, our administration will continue to work with governors across the country to ensure that they have the equipment and the supplies and the testing resources to reopen safely and responsibly.
On the subject of supplies, today we issued a letter to our nation’s governors summarizing all the medical equipment and supplies that have been distributed to their state from FEMA between the first of this month and April 14, through Project Airbridge and through the commercial supply network.  We’ll be speaking with our nation’s governors on Monday and detailing that information at that time.
As of April 16th, as the President reflected briefly, FEMA has coordinated the delivery of millions of pieces of medical equipment, including 44 million N95 respirators, 63 million surgical masks, more than 10,000 ventilators, and of course, deployed more than 8,600 federal medical station beds.
On the subject of testing resources, we’re going to take some time to speak about our administration’s approach and partnership with states to continue to expand testing across the country at this briefing.
But from the very outset of this epidemic, President Trump made efforts to essentially reinvent testing in America.  The traditional testing in this country that takes place at CDC or at state labs was designed for basically the kind of diagnostic testing that is routinely required.  But the President, early on in this effort, brought together the leading commercial labs in America, and we forged a public and private partnership.  And six weeks ago, we had performed some 25,000 tests, and at this day, we have performed 3.7 million tests.
We believe that labs and hospitals are now performing more than 120,000 tests a day.  And we’ve actually stood up a team from Walter Reed, under the direction of Dr. Deborah Birx, that is working around the clock to identify additional testing capacity across the country.  We believe that states could actually more than double the amount of daily testing that is happening today by simply activating all of the labs.  And Dr. Birx will detail some of those resources today, and we’ll be going over those very specifically with governors on Monday.
We’ve also been promoting the development of new and innovative tests.  We all know about the 15-minute Abbott test, but the FDA is currently working on an antibody test that literally could add 20 million new tests to our supply, even before the end of April.
I want to assure the American people that we’re going to continue to work with your governors and with your state health officials to scale testing in the days ahead.  But as you’ll hear from all of our experts tonight, our best scientists and health experts assess that states today have enough tests to implement the criteria of phase one, if they choose to do so.
Let me say that again: Given the — given the guidance in the President’s new Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, states that meet the criteria for going into phase one, and then are preparing the testing that is contemplated by going to phase one, our best scientists and health experts assess that, today, we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a phase one reopening, if state governors should choose to do that.  And you’ll hear more detail on that in just a moment.
At the President’s direction, we’re going to be presenting an outline of our approach to testing in partnership with states, during this briefing.  Our approach will continue to be locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.
Dr. Fauci will give us a brief introduction to the overall approach to testing that is contemplated to deal with the coronavirus.  Dr. Redfield and the CDC will describe our plan to mobilize CDC officials in all 50 states to specifically monitor coronavirus — coronavirus incidents that occur in every state in the union.
Of course, Dr. Deborah Birx will describe not only our tests, but also the current capability and the capability that we could expand to very readily.  And Admiral Giroir of the U.S. Public Health Service will summarize our approach.
But I want to assure the American people that, at the President’s direction, we are going to continue to work every single day to make sure that our states and communities have the testing they need to reopen at the time and manner of their choosing.  And we’re going to work every day to make sure our states have the resources and the supplies to reopen their states and reopen America in a safe and responsible way.
With that, Dr. Fauci.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  So, as the Vice President said, I’m going to give you a brief introduction to, kind of, answer the question that we’ve been asked a lot.  In fact, we had a very productive teleconference with the Senate Democratic Caucus just a few hours ago, and they asked a number of questions which were really reasonable questions — questions that are on the mind of a lot of different people.  And one of them was the question that was just posed a moment ago, is: Are there enough tests to allow us to be able to go through this first phase in a way that is protective of the health and the safety of the American people?
So I just want to spend a couple of minutes clarifying a few things and maybe providing some information on a broad 40,000 foot, which you’ll hear some of the more granular details from my colleagues who will be following me.  I think they — they asked me to give the “40,000 foot” one because I’m not a testing person; I didn’t run a testing lab, but I’m part of a team that is looking at this of how we can best make sure that this happens in the right way.
So, first of all, let me say something that we’ve said before, and I apologize if I’m repeating things that you already know, but I think in some respects it’s important to do that so that people have clarity in what we’re talking about.
There are two general types of tests, even though within each general type there are different subgroups.  One of them is to actually test for the infection: is a person infected.  The other — and I’ll get back to that in a second.  The other is to test, as we just mentioned, if someone has been infected — usually someone who’s been infected, who has recovered.  And as I’ll get to in a moment, that you could assume — although, we need to do some more work on that — that that person is actually protected against subsequent exposure and infection with an identical organism.
So what are some of the pluses and minuses of each?  Because the pluses and minuses are really going to impact how we best use the test and how the test actually should be used.
So let’s take the test for whether or not you’re infected. The test of whether or not you’re infected is a test that, right now, is called a nucleic acid test.  It’s not an easy test to do.  There are some that are more rapid.  There are some that have a high throughput.  There are different groups within that.  The good news about that is that it’s a sensitive and specific test, so that if you’re infected, you know you’re infected, so that — as I’ll get to in a moment — if you need to do something with that — get that person, put them in care, take care of them, get them out of circulation — that’s important.
The point about that that I think is often misunderstood is that if you get a test today — like I did today; it’s negative — if you get a test today, that does not mean that tomorrow or the next day or the next day or the next day, as you get exposed, perhaps from someone who may not even know they’re infected, that that means that I’m negative.  Which means, if you take that to its extreme, in order to be really sure, you would almost have to test somebody either every day or every other day or every week or what it is to be absolutely certain.  That’s an issue.
Now, the problem that I talk about when I try and compare this to other situations, with what testing means to you — I, as I think most people know, have been involved in HIV/AIDS for 38 years, 39 years — from the very first week of HIV.  So that’s what I do.  If you get a test for HIV and you are negative, and you do not practice any risk behaviors, you can be guaranteed that next month, six months, one year from now, you will be negative if you don’t have a risk behavior.  So there’s a big difference there about what testing actually means.
So the point I think you’re getting is that, although there is clearly a place for needing to test somebody for a given reason, a test means you’re negative now.
Now, the other test is an antibody test — a test that tells you, in fact, that you’ve been infected.  That’s really good.  You’re going to hear about that — a bit about that from my colleagues in a moment.  Because that will give you a broad view of two things: one, what the penetrance of the infection had been; and number two, you can make an assumption — though we still need to prove that.  I mean, we are assuming that if you’re infected and you have antibody, you’re protected.  And I think that’s a reasonable assumption, based on our experience with other viruses.
But what we want to make sure that we know, and these are some of the challenges: What is the titer that is protective?  How long is the protection?  Is it one month?  Is it three months?  Is it six months?  It’s a year?  So we need to be humble and modest that we don’t know everything about it, but it really is an important test.
The other thing is the difference between testing and monitoring out there — what’s out there.  The difference between what we really need it for, for phase one, is to be able to identify, isolate, contact trace.  A very important part of when you’re putting — pulling back gradually and slowly on the mitigation, and you have people who might be infected — you want to know they’re infected; you want to put them in care.  That is something that we absolutely need to do.
But there are other ways we — I want to make sure people understand that — not to underestimate the importance of testing.  Testing is a part, an important part, of a multifaceted way that we are going to control and ultimately end this outbreak.
So please don’t anyone interpret it that I’m downplaying testing, but the emphasis that we’ve been hearing is essentially, “testing is everything,” and it isn’t.  It’s the kinds of things that we’ve been doing — the mitigation strategies — that are an important part of that.
Now, just a couple of things before I hand it over to my colleagues.  No doubt — no doubt that, early on, we had a problem.  I had publicly said that we had a problem early on.  There was a problem that had to be corrected, and it was corrected.  It was a problem that was a technical problem from within that was corrected.  And it was an issue of embracing — the way we have now, and should have — the private sector, who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them for any of the things that I’ve just spoken about.
So, having said that, right now, I totally understand — and I am not alone; my colleagues understand — that although we say there are X number of tests out there — and you’re going to hear from Admiral Giroir about that — the fact is there have been and still are situations that are correctable, and will be corrected, and some of which have been corrected.
I know — I get on the phone a lot with my colleagues, because, believe it or not, some long time ago, I was where they are in the hospitals, in the emergency room, looking at very sick individuals that you need to take care of.  And I know what it means when someone tells you, “Hey, you have what you need,” and you look around and you say, “Well, maybe you think I have what I need, but I don’t really have what I need.”  So we have to figure out: How do we close that gap?
And there are a lot of things that I think we’ve learned, and that we are correcting and going to correct.  Namely, you have a situation where tests are needed and appropriate.  And either people have found there’s no tests or there’s no reagents or there’s no swabs — or a person needed a test and were told that there was a restriction; they couldn’t get a test.  These are all the things that I’m telling — you already know because you’ve heard them.  So right now — or there’s a delay of five to seven days.  And what does that mean if you want to do — if you want to get somebody out of circulation?
We understand that that existed, but upon careful examination, what you are going to hear: that many of those have been already corrected and other of those will be corrected.  Because what I think people don’t appreciate, through no fault of their own, is that there’s — that there are two issues: There’s supply and demand.  And if you have a supply that can meet the demand, but the supply is not connected to the demand, then supply/demand falls apart.
What do I mean by that?  I mean there is an existing capacity that we have that, for one reason or other, maybe has not been fully communicated as to the availability of that existing capacity.  And you’re going to hear about that now.  There’s production capacity that gets better and better and better.  And that’s what we’re talking about, because for what we need now, we believe that, with better communications, we’ll be able to make that happen.
So I know there’s going to be a lot of questions about that.  I didn’t want to go on too long, but let me just finish by saying, given what I’ve just said and what I believe what you’re going to hear, that, for what we need in the first phase — if these things are done correctly, what I believe they can — we will have and there will be enough tests to allow us to take this country safely through phase one.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony.
Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I want to make a few comments here.  First, I want to talk a little bit about CDC has developed multiple systems to monitor disease outbreaks.  I think many of you are familiar, for example, how we monitor for foodborne illness or how we monitor for antibiotic resistance in hospitals.  But we’ve also developed a system to monitor for upper respiratory tract disease.  If I can get the first slide there.
This is an example — because when we talk about what we know about this current pandemic, the reality is we know a lot because we’ve developed these monitoring systems.
Up on the slide is a system that we’ve developed initially for flu.  And what it does, as you can see, there’s multiple different flu seasons, and they track them over the course of a year.
I want you to look at the red line.  And that happens to be this year’s respiratory season.  And you see there’s a peak there up over the 50-52 week.  And that peak was when we actually had a peak of Influenza B.
This year was a little different because after that viral syndrome came down — and you can see it — that actually we had another peak.  And that’s when Influenza A was active through our country.  And you can see Influenza A started to drop.  But then you saw a third peak.  That peak was — here, we’re were looking at the coronavirus-19.
So we have systems, all the way down to the county level, that we can see where there’s respiratory tract illness.  And so it’s not just — just taking a test.  It’s monitoring these systems that have been developed over the last — over decades.  And we have multiple ones.
We have another one — this — that is monitored in emergency rooms, looking at syndrome diagnosis.  And they show the same thing.  So we’re well equipped to monitor — to see when respiratory tract viral disease will come.  And it becomes a very good surrogate for when you can begin to understand that we need to start looking more at ideologically about what’s going on.
You can see now, in week 15, we’re really coming down to the baseline background, in terms of our flu surveillance system, from the overall coronavirus situation right now.
The second thing I wanted to say is that CDC continues to enhance the state’s public health capacity to accelerate their ability — as Tony talked about, and it’s critical as we open America again — to diagnose individuals that present with influenza-like illness or coronavirus-like illness, to diagnose them, to be able to isolate them, and to be able to contact trace around them, and then diagnose the contacts.  And those that are coronavirus-positive, to go back and do their contacts.
This is the traditional public health approach, which was started in this outbreak in January, in February, and was quite successful.  And as I mentioned before, through February 27th, this country only had 14 cases.  We did that isolation and that contact tracing, and it was very successful.  But then, when the virus more exploded — got beyond the public health capacity.
But right now, CDC is enhancing that public health capacity.  And if I can get the second slide, I want to show you that — this is just showing, as we sit here today, that CDC has embedded, in these health departments and all of these state — states across this country, more than 500 individuals.  We also have an additional almost 100 individuals that are working on more than 20 coronavirus outbreaks that are going through all these states.
And finally, at the direction of the President, we’ve been asked to further enhance this deployment in each of the states, as the Vice President said, so that there’s additional public health personnel to help accelerate the state’s ability to basically move forward aggressively.  And we assist them so they can operationalize the President’s Guidelines To Open Up America Again.
So I just wanted to make those points for you today.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.
Dr. Birx.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield, for all of that clarity.
If we can have the next slide, I’m going to go back to what Dr. Fauci was talking about just to emphasize those points about the two types of tests and I’m going to talk about a third one.
So first, we all know about sampling in the front of your nose.  To all of the labs out there and to the providers, you don’t have to use the nasal pharyngeal swab anymore; you can do front-of-nose sampling.  And again, as Dr. Fauci talked about, is that is sampling for the virus itself that replicates in your nose and, as we know, throughout some of the respiratory tissues.
The second test is, of course, then your immune response to that infection that’s in your nose.  And so, that’s the antibody test.  And so those are the two tests we want to talk about.
But I want to come back to something that both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield said and we covered yesterday: Testing is a part of the exquisite monitoring that needs to occur in partnership with CDC and state and local governments, utilizing the surveillance systems that are available — what we just talked about: the flu surveillance system, because we no longer have flu, and the syndromic respiratory system.  That is across the United States, and you can see it’s going back to baseline so that we’ll be able to see, at the community level, any deviation from that baseline.
In addition, what we talked about yesterday was adding that asymptomatic component.  Because I think you’ll see, as more and more articles come out for surveillance that other — and monitoring that other states have done, higher and higher antibody in multiple individuals who don’t remember having a sickness.  And that will give us an idea — that’s our asymptomatic monitoring in these sentinel monitoring sites.  And what we talked about yesterday — we talked about nursing homes, we talked about indigenous people, and we talked about vulnerable people in the inner city, really ensuring that something that is so small, that can’t even be seen on the surveillance monitoring, will be able to be seen in the asymptomatic.
And so those are the two tests that we have: one available now, two that have been approved — or three, by the FDA.
I want to just leave you with my last concept on the antibody tests.  Antibody tests have different specificity and sensitivities.  The FDA, we’ve made that — the FDA has been very cautious about the antibody tests because I see — I know you see reports every day of countries that have ordered the antibody test and found that they were 50, 60, 70 percent faulty.  So we’re taking that very seriously because you never want to tell someone that they have an antibody and potential immunity when they don’t.  And so those tests perform better when there’s a high prevalence or a high incidence of disease.
So we want to work with mayors around the United States, as those antibody tests become available, to really see what it is in first responders and healthcare workers in the highest prevalence states, so that we can know about the quality and the real-life, real-field experience of those assays.  Because things can look very good in the lab, and then when you take them into the field, sometimes they’re not as good.  I’ve learned this lesson repeatedly in working around the globe.
The next slide.
So this is what we have asked commercial and diagnostic companies to be working on, because when you talk about multi-millions’ worth of tests, the way we do this in the United States today for strep, for influenza, and for malaria, is we test for the antigen.  Now, we don’t know, right now, if you shed antigen in the front of your nose.  And so that is the question that scientists and companies are working on right now.  Because that becomes a simpler test.
Now, the flu test — I think many of you will look it up tonight — you will see that outside of the flu season, because of the specificity of the test, it doesn’t work so well.  So these are tests we’re working on today that would be like a screening test, because if you’re positive on it, it’s a good test, but it may miss that you actually have the flu.  So then you would move into the — what we call the “nucleic acid test.”
So we’re trying to build an algorithm of tests that bring the full talent of the science of the United States into the reality of the clinic.  And so, bench to clinic.  And so this is what we’re working on for the future.
Next slide.
So as I promised both the senators and the governors, this is the United States’ current platform capacity, designated as high and low throughput.  And what do I mean by that?  There’s — we’ve talked about the high-throughput platforms of Roche and Abbott and others.  And then we’ve talked about the gene expert and other machines that may be moderate to lower throughput.
I want you to see how it’s distributed through the United States.  So these are the current testing platforms available today throughout the United States for COVID-19.  And as you heard from Dr. Fauci, everything has to be working, from the swab, to the transport media, to the laboratory, to really get those tests run and the results back to the client.
The next slide.
So then we’ve looked at all of the testing capacity from those platforms, and this gives you an idea of what that capacity is.  The darkest red — you can see, like, in Texas and New York, those are — those are states that have lots of different platforms, as you saw on the prior slide, and the ability, if you just add up the platforms and the potential for test, of over a million tests per month.
And so this is what we’re working with each of those states on unlocking that full potential.  And how are we doing that?  Well, we’re call- — we’re calling on the American Society of Microbiologists.  They have — they work closely with 300 lab directors around this — around the country; we talked with them this morning.  And the Walter Reed team who developed the entire HIV testing program for the military 35 years ago.
I’ve called them back into service and they’re calling lab by lab to find out what are the technical difficulties to bring up all the platforms that exist in your lab.  Is it swabs?  Is it transport media?  Is it extraction?  And I just really want to thank them.  They’ve already worked through over 70-plus of those laboratories to really understand.  And the American Society of Microbiologists and the academic societies of the laboratories are working together to ensure that all of this potential can be unlocked.
Next slide, please.
We talked a little bit yesterday about New Orleans, and we — and the President talked about how many tests New Orleans has done during its outbreak, which you can see now is waning.  They’ve done, throughout the last month, 27 tests per 1,000 New Orleans and Louisianians.  So 27 per thousand.  So that is a good mark, and that’s what — Italy has done about 20 per thousand.
So in evaluating an outbreak — and really to get control of this outbreak — they did about 27 tests per thousand.  So using that as a measure — next slide — we then looked across all the states of the United States of America, and looked for states that had 30 or more — ability to do 30 or more tests per thousand of their inhabitants in each state.  And you can see that, across the country, except for Oregon and Maine and —
DR. FAUCI:  Montana.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Montana.
DR. BIRX:  (Laughs.)  Montana.  I worked overseas way too long.  Thank you all.   So those are the three states that we’re working on building capacity in.  So this is just to give you a perspective of how seriously we’re taking the testing issue.
As we’ve described, we’ve measured every single platform and every single state.  We know exactly where they are, by geography, by address, by zip code, what their capacity is, what their cumulative capacity is, what their roadblocks are on non-ability to run all their full capacity.  And we’re addressing those because each one of those is different and you have to address each of them one by one with the governors, with the state and local labs, and with all of the hospitals.
I have not come across one laboratory or one laboratory director or one society that doesn’t want to contribute to solving this issue of testing and ensuring that this testing is available for everyone.
There is a strong — just as all the Americans have social distanced, and behind everyone — we don’t often talk about the laboratories; we’ll talk about the nurses and doctors on the front line — behind all of them are the laboratory technicians and laboratory directors who are coming in every day and putting things together to ensure that every single person that needs to be diagnosed is diagnosed.
And hopefully you can see from these labs — I mean these slides that, really, there is capacity out there.  It is our job, working with the states and having the state in the leadership role, and the laboratory directors in the leadership role to provide support to ensure that all the potential for testing in the United States is brought to bear.
I just want to end with — these are nucleic acid tests.  There will never be the ability on a nucleic acid test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school, but there might be with the antigen test.  And so that’s why there’s a role for nucleic acid test, there’s a role for antibody tests, and there’s a role for the future development of these other key tests to bring the full ability to the United States.
And so, when we finish this, we’ll be talking to all Americans because there’s other tests that other Americans should have.  And I think this has really brought to light the importance of diagnosis.  And we’ll talk to you further about hepatitis C and TB and other things that we can do to assure every American is healthy because I think this has really raised the awareness among all Americans about how you do test for different kinds and different parts of your disease state and what is long-lasting immunity, and what may be long-lasting immunity, and what is a nucleic acid test and what an antigen test is.
And with that, Admiral Giroir.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  And let me amplify one point, as the Admiral steps forward, to conclude remarks about our approach and the efforts we put underway.
Governors across the country have been working very closely with us to roll out the level of testing that we have today.  And all the information we presented to you is going to be reviewed in the days ahead and with all of our governors.  Our objective is to connect every one of America’s governors and state health officials and to all of the labs that are currently able to do coronavirus.
And — but Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have both described, we believe today that we have the capacity in the United States to do a sufficient amount of testing for states to move into phase one at the time and manner that they deem to be appropriate.
And with that, I’ll allow Admiral Giroir to complete our briefing on testing.  And we expect the President to return.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you to all my really great colleagues.
Can I have the — my next slide?
So I wanted to start by where we are today and just to visit where we’ve come in such a short period of time.  As everyone on the stage has said before, our testing right now is well over 3.78 million tests that have been completed.  And if you are impressed by bar graphs, that’s over 1.2 million tests reported just in the last week.
Ambassador Birx talked to me a little earlier, and she said, “You know, we only do about 2 million molecular tests a year for HIV” — something that’s been done for — developed for 35 years.  We’re now doing twice that number of tests in a month for a disease that has never been known before, that there’s never been a test developed before.  And that’s sort of where we are and where we’ve ramped up.
I also want to give you a little idea — the lighter blue or lighter gray is our ID NOW tests.  So we talk about them a lot because they are a point-of-care test that can be between 5 and 15 minutes.  And they have a very specific role, but they’re not for everybody.  If you’ve got to screen a few thousand people, four tests an hour doesn’t get you there on a machine; you have to use some of the larger, higher-throughput items.  But they have a very important role.  And, again, coming into the market at 50,000 per day is really an important adjunct to us.
She talked about the GeneXpert from Cepheid.  Very important.  We don’t talk about that very much, but it is one of the backbone mobile point-of-care — not as easy to do, per se, as the Abbott — but it is a point-of-care test that really carries tuberculosis screening all through Africa.  There are these machines — you saw that on her slide — every one of the 50 states has this in over 600 sites, and they’ve done over 700,000 tests just on that relatively low throughput, but very important platform.
Next slide, please.
I wanted to give you an idea of, sort of, how the tests are distributed and how they’re changing over time.  On the left are the state public health laboratories.  And although their numbers are relatively small — about 350,000 — the state public health laboratories are absolutely critical.  They’re — they’re an absolutely critical core component of our testing.  Not only were they there early and first, but they also do things like support outbreak investigations in nursing homes or investigations in certain plants that have close proximity with everyone because of their work environments.  They also do testing on many people who do not have the opportunity to be tested elsewhere.  And they are performing outstandingly well.
ACLA — I know we hate acronyms, but the American Clinical Laboratory Association — this is America’s commercial industrial backbone that we’re standing behind the President and the Vice President.  And when I was there a few weeks ago in the Rose Garden — this is the LabCorp, the Quest, the BioReference Laboratory, Mayo, Sonic, and ARUP.  And you’ll see they’ve done almost 2.3 million tests.  This is the very large, high-throughput machines that Dr. Birx talks about.
And I want to be clear about — about this group, is that it doesn’t matter where you are.  I just took one of the largest labs, and I said, “Map out for me where you are, within 10 miles of where you are, every site in the country.”  And when you do that, within 10 miles of a site of one of these, 93 percent of the U.S. population is covered.
These are truly national reference labs that cover almost everybody within the United States.  So if you cannot get a test at your hospital, the chances are overwhelming that you could send this to these labs that are fully caught up now.  They have no backlog of tests.  They’ve ramped up their production, so their turnaround time is about 48 hours — because you may need to transport it from the middle of America, out to a lab, and result that.  But that’s really very, very, very good.
The American Hospital Association and also academic labs — as the Vice President and the President have said, as more and more labs come online, they’re increasing the amount of testing that are done just at the hospitals or at academic medical centers — now almost at 600,000 tests.
And again, matching the other slide, I had the Abbott point-of-care tests — just to give you a distribution — and that point-of-care test is being used, very importantly, in very select populations where a point-of-care test is really needed.  That could be in some hospitals, where someone needs to know exactly if a person is positive or not to go on a clinical trial, or in a nursing home investigation, or sometimes to get people screened to go back into the work environment.
Most people don’t need a point-of-care test.  In fact, a point-of-care test does not — cannot replace the millions of tests that are here on the other slide.
Next slide.
I don’t know how interested you are in swabs.  I did not know a whole lot of swabs before a few weeks ago.  But there’s two points I want to make with these slides — is, yes, there have been constraining elements, and they’re constrained for a couple reasons.  Number one, because this is an unprecedented scale-up of this type of very sophisticated molecular tests that has never put a demand on the system like we have.  When we started out a few weeks ago, there’s very specific, one type of swab; only get it one place in the U.S., one place in Italy.  And we were stuck with that for a while because it’s not just the quantity, it’s the quality.
What I don’t want to do is put a lot of things in the system to make people believe that this is a good test, when it hasn’t been validated by the FDA, to say that a positive is a positive and a negative is a negative.  But over the past weeks, both the scientific community, the Gates Foundation, academic medical centers, the FDA, have really opened up our ability to not stick that all the way back in your nasal pharynx, but do the anterior nose, and to greatly broaden the amount of swab types that are available.
So we are really at a point, right now, that over the next — by the end of April, will put another 5 million swabs, in addition to everything that’s out there now, and, by the end of May, over 12 million new swabs in the system — more than enough to obtain the capacity that we need.
Next slide.
For these molecular tests, you take a swab and you stick it in a test tube, and that test tube has to have a specific kind of liquid in it.  And when we started, it was viral transport media — a very special kind of media.  The CDC has a “make your own recipe.”  If you’re interested in cooking, you could probably do that, but it has a lot of ingredients that go in there, but still very limiting.
We’ve worked with many, many different laboratories.  We’ve worked with the FDA.  So now, PBS, phosphate-buffered saline — a, kind of, just laboratory-grade saltwater — can be used for this.  This greatly opens the ability to expand the test to support all the capability that Dr. Birx talks about.
And again, by the end of April, we will have put well over 5 million new tubes of either viral transport media or saline into the system.
I am going to get to a conclusion here, but this was going to be more of a technical briefing.
Next slide.
So let’s talk about the fact that the science tells us that we have and will continue to have enough tests to safely go into phase one.  So let me be very granular about this: We’ve already heard that it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day.  It’s — it’s just not possible.  But it’s also a bad strategy because testing a person now just means they’re negative now.  Dr. Fauci could be positive tomorrow, because it’s brewing in his system right now and we don’t know it, or that he contacts that.  That’s not the way we go about things.
The way we go about things, as Dr. Redfield said, just — just think of the weather radar, okay?  If the weather radar is clear, you’re not going to have a thunderstorm or a tornado.  When something pops up, that’s when you’ve got to go to where the action is or know that your warning system is up.  So, sort of, think of that in the background, and I’ll go specifically about that.  So that’s monitoring.
Let me talk about how much testing we need, just for overall testing.  I’m just going to give you a number; I’m not saying that this is the number that’s there.  But let’s just take a number that we are going to enter phase one when there are 200,000 new cases per month in the United States.  Don’t get hung up on that — it’s going to be much less than that — but let’s just say 200,000 cases.  So, how many tests do we need?
Well, we need to test those 200,000 people to make the diagnosis, right?  Everybody nod your head about that.  We have to do that.  Now, what’s a safe number over that?  You know, if everybody I test has the disease, I’m not testing enough, right? But if I test 100 people to have 1 person with the disease, that’s probably over-testing.
So we kind of assume that a safe number that really gives us a good idea is if about 1 out of 10 people are positive, then we know we’re over-sampling the population enough that we’re getting all the positives.  So if there’s 200,000 cases, I need about 2 million tests.  Okay?
Now, to go to Dr. Redfield’s point, each one of those that are positive have contacts that need to be traced.  And on average, the CDC tells me that for every positive, there are about five contacts that really need to be traced.  So let’s assume that those 200,000 people have five contacts.  So now we have an extra million tests.
So 2 million tests out there to detect the 200,000 cases, an extra million out there to trace those contacts.  So we’re up to about 3 million cases.  If you want to put a fudge factor — say there’s 4 million tests, okay?
Those are generally done at the main hospital labs, the commercial labs, state and regional labs.  All this can be done — as well as some of the labs talked about by Dr. Birx.
Next slide.
The second group of testing fits exactly perfectly with the influenza-like surveillance system that Dr. Redfield talked about.  This is the monitoring.  This is, sort of, the radar — the weather radar that it would be out there — that we’re not testing people who are symptomatic.  We want to do testing on people who are asymptomatic because you can have asymptomatic carriage.  You know, you could have this virus and shed it, and not have symptoms or only mild symptoms.
So what is the strategy here?  The strategy here — this is an unprecedented strategy, okay?  This is — this is really unprecedented.  But we’re going to do, prob- — between three- and five hundred tests per week in the most vulnerable populations that we know that the virus could circulate.
And what are they?  Number one, nursing home and long-term care facilities.  We know that from the history of this — of this virus, that that can circulate and be devastating.  And it could circulate even in a way that you don’t have symptoms.  So we’re going to survey, in a very controlled way, driven by the CDC, supervised by the CDC, surveys over — we may not get to everyone, but surveying in the areas to cover, in a selective way, the 15,000 or so nursing homes.
Secondly, we want to work in vulnerable members in cities. And this is — the way we think about that is community health centers.  I’m a huge fan of community health centers that are led by HRSA.  There are there are about 30,000 community health center sites.  They take care of 30 million people — children, adults, elderly.  They care for about one third of Americans below the poverty level.  They are arrayed to take care of our most vulnerable populations.  So we want to survey asymptomatic people in those community health centers.
We also want to do in some of our indigenous population. And you know, very early, I was out here bringing machines to the Indian Health Service.  And, in fact, 1,800 members of the Public Health Service provide care to the Indian Health Service, and their Director and Chief Medical Officer are both admirals in the Indian Health Service.
Plus, workplace monitoring, particularly for workplace environments that may have very close contact or may have a high risk.  And some of those could be agricultural facilities.
So let’s just total that up.  We have 200,000 people who need a diagnosis.  To make that diagnosis, we want to test 2 million.  Okay?  So that’s 2 million.  We’re going to contact trace with a million.  And let’s just throw you a fudge factor of about 25 percent on that; so that’s 4 million.  And we have this background testing of about 400 — of about 400,000 per month.
So to safely do the testing, we need to be in the range of four and a half million — you followed my numbers, because I want you to understand — per month that —
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  For phase one.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Pardon me?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  For phase one.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  For phase one.  Right.  For phase one.  And I want to tell you that’s really how it adds up, and that’s where we are.  Right now, we’re doing about 1 million to 1.2 million per week.  We’re going to continue to push that farther and further, as we open up the laboratories and we’re able to open all the supplies that we need for that.
And I think that’s where I would like to end.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you.  I’ll ask the team to step back up for questions.  And we do anticipate, as his schedule permitted, that the President be returning momentarily.

6:06 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Our nation is engaged in a historic battle against the invisible enemy.  To win this fight, we have undertaken the greatest national mobilization since World War Two.  And that’s exactly what it’s been.
We’ve marshaled every instrument of American power, and we’ve unleashed our most potent weapon of all: the courage of the American people.
These have been trying times.  A cruel virus from a distant land has unfairly claimed thousands of precious American lives.  To every citizen who has lost a cherished loved one: Your pain is our pain.  We mourn as one national family.  Our country has come together.  We draw solace from the faith that God has received, and the departed — He has taken the departed into his eternal and loving embrace.  They will never be forgotten.
Over the last weeks and months, millions of Americans have joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt the spread of this horrible disease.  The Army built field hospitals and sports arenas and convention centers.  The Army Corps of Engineers is great.  Over 20,000 beds in record time.
The Navy sailed hospital ships to our biggest cities.  Lifesaving supplies and experimental medicines were rushed to the frontlines as we launched a rapid search for groundbreaking treatments and vaccines.
We built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world, and we’ve done more testing than any country anywhere in the world.
We suspended dangerous foreign travel.  We leveraged our industrial base to produce vast quantities of critical medical gear and enacted a historic 2-trillion-dollar relief package.
Through it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before — these are our warriors — the bravery of our truck drivers — such bravery — and food suppliers — such incredible bravery, and the determination and drive of our citizens.  Through this unified national endeavor, we have made great progress.  You could really say incredible progress.
Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.  Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million U.S. deaths — if there was no mitigation, it could have even been higher than that — and between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation.  It’s looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers.
Thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection.  But there is no such thing as an optimistic projection on death.  One person is too many.
Our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us.  Nationwide, more than 850 counties, or nearly 30 percent of our country, have reported no new cases in the last seven days.
Because of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of healthcare rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen many other nations — nations which, wherever possible, we are helping.  In America, no person who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator.  We’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators.  We’ve delivered thousands and thousands of ventilators to the states.
And actually, it’s been an incredible operation.  We started with very little and we ended with a lot.  The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries.
Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we’re calling, “Opening Up America Again.”  And that’s what we’re doing: We’re opening up our country.  And we have to do that.  America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open.
As I have said for some time now, a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution.  To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy.  Over the long haul, you can’t do one without the other.  It cannot be done.  To keep vital supply chains running, these chains have to be taken care of so delicately.  They’re delicate.  The balance is delicate.
We want to deliver food and medical supply.  We must have a working economy.  And we want to get it back very, very quickly, and that’s what’s going to happen.  I believe it will boom.
A prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health.  This includes a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing.  Moreover, many patients have put needed medical care on hold, creating entirely new hazards for public health.
Our country has suffered.  The world has suffered.  One hundred and eighty-four other countries have suffered.
Therefore, my administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states.  I’ve dealt with them now a long time, and we’ve had a great relationship — Democrat, Republican.  The relationship has been good.  This strategy is based on hard, verifiable data.
I want to thank Dr. Birx for her incredible leadership in crafting these guidelines in consultation with scientists, experts, and medical professionals across government.  Dr. Birx will explain the guidelines in more detail in a few moments.  And Dr. Fauci has been absolutely terrific.  We’ve all worked together, and we’ve worked together well.
They are interested in the health of our country.  And we’re all interested in the viability and making us truly great again.  We took the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we closed it in order to win this war.  And we’re in the process of winning it now.
Our approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life.  We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time.  And some states will be able to open up sooner than others.  Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in.
Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again, we’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.
Our strategy will continue to protect senior citizens and other vulnerable populations while allowing military and other groups of incredibly talented people to go about their real business and the business that’s supposed to be hard at work at doing.  And nobody does it better.  Our military is the greatest anywhere in the world, and we’re so thankful for what they’ve done.
Healthy Americans will now be able to return to work as conditions on the ground allow.  Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest-risk individuals.  So important.  We’re establishing clear scientific, metric, and — benchmarks on testing, new case growth, and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase.  And that’s each phase specifically in the reopening of our country.
This is a gradual process.  As the caseload in a state continues to go down, restrictions can continue to be eased and come off.  Throughout the process, citizens will continue to be called upon to use all of their weapons in this war: vigorous hygiene, teleworking when possible, staying at home if you feel sick, maintaining social distance, sanitizing commonly used surfaces, and being highly conscious of their surroundings.  Those are our weapons, and they’re very powerful weapons indeed.
Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states.  Every state is very different.  They’re all beautiful.  We love them all.  But they’re very, very different.  If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that.  And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task — and very, very quickly — depending on what they want to do.
We are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts.  We’ll have numerous cases where states have worked and will be working very, very closely together.
As we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead.  Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly.  If the virus returns in the fall, as some scientists think it may possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.
At the heart of our strategy is the vital role of medical research, especially for therapies that will significantly improve outcomes for high-risk patients and reduce the need for urgent care.  This will be tremendously valuable in allowing life to eventually return to normal.  At least 35 clinical trials are already underway, including antiviral therapies, immune therapies, and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma.  You’ve all heard about some of these events and some of these therapies.  They’ve come a long way.  What’s been done in the last four weeks is incredible.
We will also continue to expand our testing capacity.  We have now completed more than 3.5 million tests — by far the most anywhere in the world.  Areas of our country that have been hotspots have done much more testing, on a per capita basis, than South Korea.  We’ve done more than South Korea — and South Korea has done a good job, but we’ve done more.
We will continue to work with governors to advise them on how to conduct both surveillance and diagnostic testing.  We have now distributed over 600,000 Abbott ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic tests.  These are tests that are done on site, and, within five minutes, you know the answer: positive or negative.
In recent days, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests performed by hospitals and academic institutions, with more than 120,000 tests recently reported in a single day — far more than any country in the world has ever been able to do.  And our numbers are actually going up.
As these new and better testing solutions come online, we’re seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers.  For this reason, the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100,000 to roughly 75,000 tests over the last week.  The reason it dropped is because we have so many other tests and we don’t even have to go through the laboratories.  But the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity, and states feel free to use that capacity.
Some in the media falsely reported this as a bad thing, when, in fact, it is a great thing because it indicates that the states are moving to faster, more local testing solutions, including on-the-spot tests.
So this drop in the utilization of commercial laboratories is an affirmation that testing, which is at an all-time high, is growing at a historic rate.  In other words, the laboratories are great, but now we have forms of testing that are much quicker, much better, and we don’t have to use the laboratories.  But they’re there, and they have a great capacity to do the work.
As Dr. Birx has been advising our governors for weeks, we continue to have an excess testing capacity of 1 million tests per week available for use.  And our capabilities are growing every single day, especially with the new tests that are coming onto the market rapidly.
As we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad.  Border control, travel restrictions, and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work.
The sacrifices our citizens have made in this time of crisis will be remembered, studied, honored, and praised for generations to come.  We’re really all working together.  Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal — we’re all working together.  This is not about parties; this is about our country.
Now the American people are ready to rise to the occasion once again.  They are ready to show the world once more that Americans can defeat any challenger.  Together, we will rebuild this land that we love, we will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share, and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory.
I would now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Birx to further explain the new guidelines.  I want to thank Dr. Birx.  I want to thank Dr. Fauci.  And I want to thank, really especially, a man who has devoted 24 hours a day to his task force and done such an incredible job — our great Vice President, Mike Pence.
Please, Mike.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force today joined the President to meet with a bipartisan group of members of the House and of the Senate to get their counsel on the development of what the President unveiled to America’s governors this afternoon.
The new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again” are a product of the best science and the best common sense that the President has marshaled on this team and from a broad range of advisors from all across the nation.
From the moment President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force, early on he made it clear that we have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.
The President launched a whole-of-government approach.  And while we stand here, on this day, with more than 640,000 Americans having contracted the coronavirus — and our hearts go out to the families of the more than 31,000 Americans who lost their lives and those who continue to struggle with serious consequences of the coronavirus — the truth is that because of the decisive action that our President took early on, suspending travel from China and thereafter from portions of Europe and South Korea; screening passengers; because of the strong actions in partnership with every governor across America; because of the extraordinary efforts of America’s healthcare workers on the frontlines; and because of the cooperation of the American people and God’s grace, we are slowing the spread, we are flattening the curve, we have preserved the capacity of our healthcare system, and we’ve protected the most vulnerable.
In a word, because of the actions of this President, this administration, governors at every level, our healthcare workers, and our fellow Americans, we’ve saved lives.  And every American should be comforted by that.
And we can see it in the numbers, in the charts that I’ll present today.  These three maps track influenza-like illness, which, in this instance, is mostly coronavirus across America.  The first map reflects the total number of cases on the week ending March the 28th.  The next map reflects our data about the total number of cases on the week ending April 4.  And we stand here today with the final map reflecting the total number of cases across America, as of April the 11th.
With these trends underway, President Trump tasked the White House Coronavirus Task Force to develop new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again.”  Those guidelines were presented today — first, to our nation’s governors.  And it is our intention, at the President’s direction, to provide these guidelines to assist governors and state health officials in evaluating the most responsible manner to reopen the economies of their states at a time and manner of their choosing.
The guidelines, as Americans who are looking on will note, begin with what is the best criteria that our experts have developed — a downward trajectory in cases over a 14-day period of time — ensuring that states have proper capacity in their healthcare facilities.
The second set of proposals includes a description of recommendations for state preparedness.  And let me say to the American people what President Trump made clear to our governors today: that our administration will continue to work day in and day out — through our task force, through FEMA — to ensure that our states have not only the medical supplies, but that we continue to rapidly expand testing across the nation.
The President reflected on the progress we’ve made on testing, but a few statistics for that as well, which I hope are an encouragement to the American people.  On March 11, we had performed a total of 23,588 tests.  Because of the public-private partnership that President Trump initiated with commercial labs across the country, that number was 83,500 by March 18.  And as the President just said, that number is 3.5 million today.  It is our expectation that we will have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of the month of April, and we’ll continue to scale those resources.
So, testing and medical supplies will continue to be an ongoing partnership with our states, and we want our healthcare workers and people all across the country to know of our commitment to that.
Finally, the President directed us to propose a phased approach to reopening — to reopening our economy.  It is based on up-to-date data and readiness, and we’ll continue to provide the very best data to our states, working with their health officials.
The focus is on the mitigation of any risk of resurgence or the emergence of the coronavirus in states where it’s not yet emerged.  There is a focus in the President’s new guidelines on the most vulnerable.
And it’s — we made this very clear to the governors today: These new guidelines for “Opening Up America Again” can be implemented on a statewide basis or on a county-by-county basis.
With that, I’m happy to turn it over to Dr. Deborah Birx and, if I may, Mr. President, I’d like to also extend my admiration and appreciation to Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and every member of our task force that worked around the clock to develop these recommendations for opening up America.  I know every American is grateful for your leadership and for theirs.
Deborah.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  We’re going to go through these quickly because I know you have them, and many of you have already spoken to them on television.
Next slide, please.
This is a very important slide.  It talks about the gatekeeping — on the gatekeeping criteria to moving into phase one.  It’s very much related to what you just saw about influenza-like illness.  And the United States has been tracking influenza-like illnesses through the Centers of Disease Control for years.
Both the state and public health officials are used to watching this, county health officials are used to watching it, and frankly, every family around the United States knows how to access this on the CDC website in order to get update — up-to-date information to the communities.
It also looks at a syndromic emergency room-type visits — again, housed at the CDC — and really is our surveillance program that can be utilized for a lot of different illnesses, but in this case, will be utilized for respiratory diseases.
In addition, we are tracking the number of cases, and it must have a downward trajectory for 14 days — as well as the influenza-like illness and the syndromic illnesses — and a downward trajectory in the number of positive tests with persistence of high levels of testing.
For the hospitals, it’s to ensure that we can treat all patients without resorting to any crisis care and ensuring that there’s a robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including frontline responders with the emerging antibody tests.
Next slide.
Now, just to show you what this looks like: So what the CDC did for me, under the direction of Bob Redfield, was to chart what would the syndromic illnesses were reporting throughout the early part of March.  And you can see, in New Orleans, respiratory diseases were starting to be seen in the emergency room.  That is the red line.  The cases are shown in the dark blue line.  The gray mountain is testing, and underneath that is the blue mountain of positives.  And you can see that the early alert was present from the emergency room about early respiratory disease.  You can see it predated the cases.
So, throughout the summer, when we do not have flu to contaminate this picture, we’ll be able to follow this syndromic pattern city by city, county by county, community by community, state by state.
Next slide.
In addition, the CDC has the influenza-like illness net distributed throughout the United States — very useful in the wintertime.  That first peak is influenza B in the red; that’s this season.  I showed you all the seasons here so you could see the seasons as they are displayed.
The first peak is influenza B, second peak influenza A.  And then you can see the coronavirus.  And you can see its decline, and it’s declining towards the baseline.  This will allow us — again, city by city, community by community, state by state — to look for variations and an early response mode in those localities that I described.
Next slide.
So hopefully you see that we’ve brought CDC and their amazing talent of individuals at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and all of their abilities to this response and also to the surveillance that we need in this response.
But I want to call your attention to the third bullet on this graphic.  So we’re tracking those two pieces that I described.  But the third bullet is about setting up sentinel surveillance sites to be able to distinguish and find asymptomatic individuals — individuals that you have heard about that may be either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic throughout their entire disease course.  We want to be able to find them in communities of particular vulnerability.
So we’ll be doing sentinel surveillance throughout nursing homes, throughout inner-city federal clinics, throughout indigenous populations, to really be able to find early alerts of asymptomatic individuals in the community.  And both for the syndromic cases that are tested, the influenza-like cases, and the asymptomatic cases: doing contact tracing, again, with support from the Centers for Disease Control, working with each state and local government.
In addition, we want to make sure that all the healthcare facilities have adequate protective — personal protective devices and the equipment to handle the surge and to ensure the ICUs can handle increased capacity.
We want every state to have a plan for the health and safety of its workers in critical industries, and to protect the health and safety of those living in high-risk facilities, including senior care facilities, as we discussed with sentinel surveillance but also additional surveillance.
When we talked with all of the states that had not had a major metro outbreak, their sentinel surveillances picked up, always, the first cases in nursing homes.  And so this is very much a big focus of the plan moving forward.  I won’t go into the rest of the details on this slide, but there’s quite a bit of details on the expectations of every state and local government.
Next slide.
You’ll recognize this slide, it’s a — next slide, please.  You’ll recognize this slide; it’s what we’ve been talking about in the 15 and 30 days to prevent the spread.  It’s continuing those critical handwashing or sanitizer; avoiding touching your face at all times; disinfecting surfaces; using face covering while in public; following state and local guidelines; and, critically, staying home if you are sick.
I know a lot of people go to the workplace when they are feeling ill.  You know when you’re feeling ill.  It won’t get better by going to work.  So we’re asking again for people to stay home when they’re sick.
Next slide is for employers to ensure that there can be social distancing and protective equipment; temperature checks; use of disinfectant in high-traffic areas, including break rooms; and ensuring that we don’t do — there’s no non-essential business travel; and then monitoring for any symptomatic individuals in the workplace.  And again, if you come — become ill at work, to immediately to go home and ensure that there’s contact tracing of all the individuals that become sick.
I’m going to go through the phases very quickly, but you have the details.
Phase one: Again, you have to go through those gating criterias related to 14 days of decreasing evidence of illness and decreasing testing, despite adequate testing.  So phase one begins with all vulnerable individuals, including those with comorbidities continuing to shelter in place and ensuring that those — the first to go out into the public are not those that are most vulnerable to bad outcomes in this disease.  And then ensuring that we continue to do six-feet maximum physical distancing in public spaces, continuing to avoid large gatherings and all non-essential travel.
For the employers — next slide — again, if a vulnerable population needs to return to work and cannot be teleworking, there should be special accommodations for all vulnerable populations, as well as options for teleworking.  We believe every employee should encourage work return in phases: from 20 percent or 25 percent, to 40 percent, to 50 percent.  And again, minimize all non-essential travel.
Phase one continued — next slide.  If the schools are already closed, they should remain closed.  All visits to senior living facilities and hospitals should be continued to be prohibited.  Large venues, including sit-down dining, can only be operated under strict physical distancing protocols and maintaining those six feet.  Gyms could open if they, again, adhere to strict physical distancing.  And elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient basis.
Phase two — next slide.  Next slide.  Again, you have to go through the criteria, again, of a continuation of another 14-day decline among those criterias that were in the gating.  Again, we’re asking for all vulnerable individuals: Shelter in place.
We did not put a timeline on any of the phases.  We want the governors, with the data that they have, community by community, to be setting up those timelines.  Again, we’re asking for the public to continue to maximize physical distance; however, we increased social settings to be able to now have 50 individuals, and non-essential travel can resume.
Next slide.
This is for the employers.  We still would like to encourage telework, and the common areas should remain closed or be physically distant.  All non-essential travel for employees can resume.  And then, again, special accommodations for vulnerable.
Next slide.
This should be a relief to many of — households that have small children.  Schools, daycares, and camps can reopen in phase two.  Visits to senior-living facilities, however, should remain — and hospitals — prohibited.  Large venues can operate but solely under moderate physical distancing.  And elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient and inpatient basis.
Phase three: And so phase three — I won’t go through in detail — it’s essentially returning to our new normal, with all of what we talked about through all phases: continuing the good hygiene practices, continuing the respect for spaces between individuals, because we know that we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread.
I do believe with this plan that we’re both confronting the issue of finding symptomatic individuals through our networks with early alert, as well as those who come and present to different hospitals and emergency room with testing and contact tracing, but critically have put in place what we believe is a safety net through asymptomatic sentinel surveillance that is centered around our most vulnerable groups — between nursing homes and our Native American people and indigenous populations, and our inner city groups that we know may be in multi-generational households and have unique risk.
I’ll stop there, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Please, Tony.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  So as you’ve seen just now from the detailed presentation from Dr. Birx, this is a rather robust program for re-entering into normality.
There’s a lot of details here, and I know it’ll take a little bit of time to digest them all.  So what I thought would be good, since I really want to be brief to allow time for questions, is to kind of take us back to the discussions that we’ve had here before and why this is a natural evolution from what we had said before.
You might recall that, on a few occasions when I was up here before you, I told you that when we get to the point where we’re going to take those steps towards trying to get back to some form of normality, that it would not be a light switch that you could turn on and off.  I meant that in two different components.
First of all, that we are a very large country and we have different dynamics in the country.  We have areas of the country that have gone through a terrible ordeal, and others that fortunately have gone and gotten — gotten through this rather lightly.  So that’s the first thing.
The second thing is that light switch, on and off, is the exact opposite of what you see here, which is a gradual gradation.  But the first thing and the only thing in mind, as the health people here — and my colleagues, who are either physicians, scientists, or public health issues — the predominant and completely driving element that we put into this was the safety and the health of the American public.
And I know there are a lot of other considerations that go into opening — considerations that you’ve heard of right from this podium.  But the dominating drive of this was to make sure that this is done in the safest way possible.
So let me just make a couple of comments to just reiterate more, from a broader standpoint, the things that Dr. Birx did so well in a very a granular detail.
First of all, in order to even consider getting into the phasing, you have to pass a hurdle.  And that’s the hurdle that we refer to as “gating in.”  Now, when you think about it and look at the map of the country and look at the differences in different parts of the country, you will see that there are some regions, states, locations that are going to be almost already into some of that gating, and will have already fulfilled some of those criteria.  Others, because of the dynamics of the outbreak in the area, will take longer to be able to do that.  But you don’t get to phase one until you get through the gating.
And then in order to make sure that safety and health is the dominant issue, the design of the phases were just that.  You go into phase one.  If you get no rebound and you satisfy the gating for yet again a second time, then you go to phase two.  If you have no rebound and you satisfy the gating criteria for a third time, you go into phase three.  So there are multiple checkpoints of safety there.
So as I’ve said, from this podium, when we were talking about the first 15 days of the mitigation and then we extended it another 30 days, I essentially pleaded with the American public to say, “Let us make sure we do the best that we can to accomplish that.”
And, in fact, mitigation works.  You saw the charts that the Vice President and that Dr. Birx put up.  It worked.  And what we hope and I believe we will be successful: If we carefully do this — again, with the attention to the safety and health of the American public — that we will be able to — and it will be staggered.  Not every state, not every region is going to do it at the same time; that’s clearly obvious because of the very dynamics of the outbreak.
But we feel confident that, sooner or later, we will get to the point — hopefully sooner, with safety as the most important thing — to a point where we can get back to some form of normality.
The one thing I liked about it that — that Dr. Birx said so well — is that no matter what phase you’re in, there are certain fundamental things that we’ve done that are not like it was in September and October.  You want to call it the “new normal” — you can call it whatever you want.  But even if you are in phase one, two, three, it’s not, “Okay, game over.”  It’s not.  It’s going to be a way that we protect ourselves because, as we know, and as I’ve said from this podium, it may very well be — as we go the cycle around — that there’ll be this virus that wants to come back to us.
I think we’re going to be able to handle that.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you.  Tony, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-27/

5:49 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Please.  Thank you.  A big day today at the White House.  All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy.  While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working — and very strongly working, I might add.
New cases are declining throughout the New York metropolitan area.  Cases in the Detroit and Denver metro areas are flat.  Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and St. Louis are showing great signs of progress, and new cases in Houston and New Orleans are declining.
The battle continues, but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases.  Hopefully that will continue and we will continue to make great progress.
These encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we’ll be announcing.  We’re going to be talking about that tomorrow.  We’ll be having a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon.  We’re going to be announcing guidelines, and we’ll be talking about various states.  And it’s very exciting.
It’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world.  The greatest.  There’s never been an economy like what we had produced, but we’ll produce it again.  And I think we’ll produce it again very fast.
The medical and healthcare advances we’ve made are critical to our continued progress.  We’ve rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests.  To date, we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further.
Today, Abbott Labs announced that it has developed an antibody test that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity.  It’s a great test.  The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks.
My administration is also distributing vast amounts of medical supplies to states across the country through Project Air Bridge, which has been an amazing success.  We have completed 44 flights — and these are flights of very, very large airplanes, massive cargo planes — 44 flights of critical supplies as of today and an additional 56 flights scheduled in the near future.  We have some very brilliant people working on this.  It’s logistically incredible what they’ve done.  And we’ve also been working on this with the military.  And these people have been — the genius of all of them together, it has been incredible to watch.
In total, through all channels, the federal government has developed and delivered 39.4 million N95 masks, 431 million gloves, 57 million surgical masks, and 10.2 million gowns.  We ordered 500 million masks, and they’ll be coming shortly.  And we’ve distributed 100 million masks.
Following our use of the Defense Production Act, GM announced that its first ventilators come off the assembly line in Kokomo, Indiana — a great place.  They did it in 11 days, from start to finish, a remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the American worker.  GM will ship over 600 ventilators this month alone, with thousands more to come.  And we have other companies doing something similar.
And I think they said that there’s a brief clip that we have of General Motors, sent to us by General Motors.  And I think they might be wanting to play that for your benefit.  Please.
(A video is played.)
I know you got a little bit nervous when you saw there was a clip about ready to be played, but that was sent to us by General Motors, and we thought it would be a good one to play.  It’s amazing.  It’s — you know, what they’ve done in a very, very short period of time.
They’re now making thousands of ventilators, and they’re coming out of the factory very rapidly, at a clip that nobody can even believe.  But we have others also doing it.  And these are very high-grade ventilators.  So we’re helping a lot of people.  And at this moment, nobody needs them.  We have to remember, during the surge, nobody has needed him for weeks now.
But we’ll have them for stockpiles, and very importantly, we’re going to have them for other countries because nobody is able to do things like we can do.  And we’re going to be able to help other countries that are having tremendous problems, to put it mildly.
My administration is using every available authority to accelerate the development, study, and delivery of therapies — so important, therapies — treatments, and ultimately, what we want to come up with is a safe vaccine.  But frankly, the therapies, to me, are the most important because it takes care of people right now.  The vaccines have to be tested, so it takes a longer period of time.  But we have some great potential therapies already, and we’ll see how they’re working.  We’ll be able to report on that, I think, over the next week or two.  Tremendous progress has been made.
At least 35 clinical trials of promising therapies are now underway.  So 35 different genius companies.  If you look at AIDS, if you look at Ebola, if you look at so many things, they’ve come up with the answers to so many things, you wouldn’t have believed it.  And we’re very honored to be working with them.
They include antivirals, and also — and they — something which is incredible: It keeps the virus from multiplying.  A mechanism that keeps the virus from multiplying.  Immune therapies that prevent the immune system from overreaching to the virus.  And convalescent plasma treatments that use antibodies from the blood of recovered patients.
And we have a lot of patients who recover, and they’re so happy to have recovered that the first thing they do is say, “We want to give our blood.”  And they do that.  It’s incredible.  We have thousands of people that are doing that.  They recover and they feel they have an obligation because they’ve gotten such great care.  And a lot of them didn’t think they were going to make it.
As the entire U.S. government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that the key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed.  And we’re not allowing that to take place through our Congress.  They’re just not — they’re just not giving it to us.  We have many, many positions that are unstaffed because we can’t get the approvals.  The Democrats are holding us up.  We cannot get approval.
We’ve gotten judges because we go through the process.  I guess we’re up to 448 federal judges.  And that, we’ve gotten because we focus on it; we take the maximum time.  Because no matter who the judge is, they take vast numbers of days and hours to approve, and it leaves no time left for others.  Very unfair system.
If a judge is going to be approved in one hour, in one session, it doesn’t matter — they’ll take the maximum number of hours and days — you’re talking about days — to get one judge approved.  And we’re close to 250 judges, but because of the way they’re doing it, there’s no time for anybody else.  And many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years.  We have a couple that have been waiting for longer than that.
There are currently 129 nominees stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction.  Many are nominated for vacancies that must be filled to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the resulting economic challenges.  And I’ve read, over the last couple of years, “Well, I didn’t fill positions.”  I don’t fill positions — in some cases, we don’t need the position, and I’m all for that.  But in many cases, you do, but we can’t get them approved by the Democrats.  They won’t release them.
The positions include the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets of the United States, and the Undersecretary of Agriculture responsible for administering food security programs.  And Sonny Perdue, who’s going to be speaking today, is saying, “Please, can I have this man, can I have this particular person approved as soon as possible?”  He’s been telling me that for a long time, and the Democrats won’t allow it to happen.
Again, every single judge, every nominee we have goes through maximum, or at least they go through a long process.  So it takes days and days, and there’s no time left.  And it’s just a concerted effort to make life difficult.
An example is Michael Pack.  He’s my nominee for the CEO of the Broadcasking [sic] — Broadcasting Board of Governors.  And he’s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America.  Very important.
And if you heard what’s coming out of the Voice of America, it’s disgusting.  What — things they say are disgusting toward our country.  And Michael Pack would get in and he’d do a great job, but he’s been waiting now for two years.  Can’t get him approved.
The senators left Washington until at least May 4th.  The Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances — the “recess appointment,” it’s called — the Senate’s practice of dabbling into so-called pro forma sessions where no one is even there.  It has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that we’re giving — that we’re given under the recess provisions.
The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments.  We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government — and now more so than ever before, because of the virus and the problem.  We have to do it, and we have to do whatever we have to do.  They’ve made it very, very difficult to run government.  I don’t think any administration has done anywhere near what we’ve done in three and a half years.
But every block — every week, they put up roadblocks, whether it’s “Russia, Russia, Russia,” or whether it’s impeachment hoax, or whatever it may be.  It’s always roadblocks and a waste of time.
If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.  The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis.  It is a scam, what they do.  It’s a scam, and everybody knows it.  And it’s been that way for a long time.  And perhaps it’s never done before — it’s never been done before; nobody is even sure if it has.  But we’re going to do it.  We need these people here.  We need people for this crisis, and we don’t want to play any more political games.
I’ve been waiting for two and a half years, three years, for some of these people.  And they’re great people.  They left law firms.  They left jobs.  They gave up everything to do it.  And they’ve been waiting for three years, two and a half years, two years, one year to get approved.  It’s ridiculous.  And everyone knows they’re going to be approved.  But there’s only so many hours in the day, when you go through judges and you go through a lengthy hearings on judges that they know should be approved immediately.  And they could do it in one session, one — and they could do it in one hour.  And instead, it takes them many days.
In order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nations, as we announced yesterday, the U.S. government has put a hold on funding to the WHO — World Health Organization — pending a review of the organization’s cover-up and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak.  Over the objections of the WHO, we took decisive action and early lifesaving action to suspend travel from China.  They didn’t want to do it.  They were angry that we did it.  It was early on.  They were angry that we did it.  Took them a long time to realize what was going on, but I have a feeling they know exactly what was going on.
Tragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn’t do any form of ban.  And you see what happened to Italy.  You see what happened to Spain.  You see what happened to France.  WHO’s guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world.  That was a horrible, tragic mistake — or perhaps they knew.  I’m sure they didn’t know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew.  Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense.
To ease the economic pain of millions of American families, we’ve now processed $300 billion in loans to more than 1 million small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program.  This action has saved millions of American jobs.  It’s been an incredible success.  And they want to replenish it now, but, again, the Democrats don’t want to do that.  This is money that goes to the workers of our country.
Phase one was $350 billion dollars.  And now phase two, we want to do $250 billion.  This goes to workers and it goes to small businesses so we can save all the small businesses around our nation.
Mike McFarland from Nebraska recently said this historic relief has been a godsend for his small factory, and the 136 Americans who work there.  He saved those jobs.  Another small business owner, Tim Miller from Oklahoma, called the program a total lifesaver for his auto-repair shop’s four employees.  Stories like these underscore why Congress must replenish the Paycheck Protection Program immediately.  The Republicans want to do it; they want to do it immediately.  They want to do it now.  And the Democrats are stopping it.
A short time ago, CDC issued public health guidelines for critical industries.  In a few moments, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue will elaborate on how these guidelines apply to our nation’s dedicated workers in the food processing profession — because it’s a profession.  It’s incredible what they do: food processing.  And they’re keeping our grocery stores full.  The shelves are not bare like the shelves that I inherited when we took over the stockpile — the medical stockpile, where the shelves were bare.  “The cupboard was bare,” I say.
Tomorrow, I’ll also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed.  And we really think, with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we’re going to have an economy that really comes back quickly.  And we’d like to see it more than match what we had before.  What we had before was a miracle.  And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle.  We’re going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world.
We’ll also be speaking to America’s governors tomorrow and then we’ll be announcing exactly what’s happening.  You already know we’ll be opening up states — some states much sooner than others.  And we think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1st.  And I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed.
Governors are looking forward — they’re chomping at the bit to get going.  Again, not all states are the same.  They’re very different.  Some are having very little problems.  Some have done such a good job that they have very little problem and they’re ready to go.  So, Vice President Pence and I will be speaking with the governors tomorrow.  We’ll be discussing procedures.
Today, I spoke with the leaders of many of our nation’s most renowned companies and organizations on how to achieve the full resurgence of the American economy.  My discussions included top leaders in health and healthcare, transportation technology, financial services, food, beverages, hospitality, real estate, retail, agriculture, construction, energy, labor, manufacturing, and sports industries.
We want to get our country open again.  We want to have our sports leagues open.  You want to watch sports.  It’s important.  We miss sports.  We miss everything.  We want to get back.
These experts and innovators provided extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy.  They gave us a lot of great ideas.  We spoke to a lot of very, very smart people — the highest of the high-tech.  The level of I","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-26/

6:14 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Please.  Very importantly, I’d like to begin by saying that we’ve just reached agreement — the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines — to participate in a Payroll Support Program.  This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy, and protect taxpayers.  Our airlines are now in good shape, and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them.
The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus.  We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light.  We see that tunnel.  And at the end of that tunnel, we see light.  We’re starting to see it.
More than ever before, we’ve held our rate, the numbers — everything we’ve done.  We’ve been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it.  You look at what’s happening in other countries — Spain, Italy, United Kingdom.  We’re working with them.  We’re trying to help them, especially with ventilators.  They’ve been calling a lot.  They need ventilators so badly.
Fifteen percent of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases.  Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, “Wow, that looks bad.”  But they don’t have the problem.
I salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing — even you people.  It’s so different looking out there when I look at you.  Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives.
Today I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.  Everybody knows what’s going on there.
American taxpayers provide between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO.  In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less.  As the organization’s leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability.
One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations.  They were very much opposed to what we did.  Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives.  Thousands and thousands of people would have died.
Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved.  Instead, look at the rest of the world.  Look at parts of Europe.  Other nations and regions, who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world.  Many countries said, “We’re going to listen to the WHO,” and they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe.  Nobody can believe.
The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days.  The WHO’s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures.  Travel bans work for the same reason that quarantines work.  Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission.  Border control is fundamental to virus control.
Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world and, most importantly, to help prevent global health crises.  With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America’s generosity has been put to the best use possible.
The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain that and share information in a timely and transparent fashion.
The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it’s not, to independently to tell the world the truth about what is happening.
The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable.  It’s time, after all of these decades.  The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts.  There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate, and investigate immediately.
Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary.  The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency caused valuable time, tremendous amounts of time.  More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts in to examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done.  The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples, to this date, has deprived the scientific community of essential data.
New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis points to the unreliability of the initial reports, and the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality.
The silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors and on new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID-19 in the country of origin is deeply concerning, especially when we put up, by far, the largest amount of money.  Not even close.
Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source, with very little death — very little death — and certainly very little death by comparison.  This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage.
Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency.  I don’t think so.  The WHO pushed China’s misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans.  They told us, when we put on our travel ban — a very strong travel ban — there was no need to do it.  “Don’t do it.”  They actually fought us.
The WHO’s reliance on China’s disclosures likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that.
The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many.
America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions.  If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals.  We’ll have no choice but to do that.
Our countries are now experiencing — you look all over the world — tremendous death and economic devastation because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so.  It would have been so easy to be truthful.  And so much death has been caused by their mistakes.
We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms.  For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others.  All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful lettel [sic] — letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups — medically, politically, and every other way.
And we’ll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners: what do we do with all of that money that goes to WHO.  And maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won’t.  But we’ll be able to see.
As you know, in other countries hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators.  But due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our healthcare workers, and the resilience of our healthcare system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator — with all of the talk you’ve heard, where some states wanted 40,000 ventilators.  I said, “That doesn’t work,” 40,000.  And they ended up with seven or eight thousand, and they had no problem.  Forty thousand ventilators for one state is ridiculous.
The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators.  This is the system we inherited.  I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.
And you look at the states.  The states didn’t have — the states were not prepared.  I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn’t get one would die.  And that’s what we were told: They would die.  I saw another country’s doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn’t.  And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis.  Those that didn’t get ventilators were said to be in a position only of one alternative — and that was death.  Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn’t get them ventilators and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately?  I instructed my team to move Heaven and Earth to make sure that this didn’t happen.
We started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had.  And I got daily updates on the supply we had from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates.  We had a great group of people working on it.
I instructed my team to use the Defense Production Act.  And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully — more powerfully than anybody would know.  In fact, so powerfully that, for the most part, we didn’t have to officially take it out — it was a hammer; it was a very powerful hammer — in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible.
Last year, America manufactured, from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators.  And this year, the number will be over 150,000 ventilators.  It could be as high as 200,000 — far more than we’ll ever need.  So we’ll be able to stockpile.  We’ll be able to talk to states about stockpiling.
These are high-quality ventilators.  We had a choice: We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high-quality.  We’ve done a high-quality ventilator.
So we should have anywhere from 150- to 200,000 ventilators.  In addition to that, we have 10,000 ventilators right now in the federal stockpile ready to move should we need them — we might not — should we need them in New York or New Jersey or in Louisiana or in Illinois or any other state that may need them if we have a surge.
I’d like to ask Adam Boehler to come up and just say a few words.  He’s done a fantastic job — a young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation.  And I’d just like to have — have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words.
Adam, please.  Thank you very much.
MR. BOEHLER:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible.  Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly, with over 100,000 by the end of June.
At the same time, there are over 60,000 ventilators in our hospitals right now that are not in use.  Knowing this and at your direction, we reached out to the American Hospital Association to design a system that allows hospitals to lend ventilators to other hospitals right when they need it.
Within the past week alone, 20 top health systems have signed up for this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, representing over 4,000 ventilators.  Not only do we have top academic systems, like Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, but we also have top health systems from New York City, New Orleans, Washington State, and California.  Over a week ago, these places would have needed help, but now they are here to help.  There’s been no American that has needed a ventilator that has not received one.
This Dynamic Virtual [Ventilator] Reserve, combined with our strategic stockpile will ensure that this is always the case.  I’d like to thank the President for his leadership and directive to focus on public-private partnerships like this one.  I’d also like to thank Sam Hazen from HCA, Lloyd Dean from CommonSpirit for leading this effort with the AHA and the Federation of American Hospitals.
These have been difficult times.  A few weeks ago, the Vice President came into my office and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies.  We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President.
This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Fantastic job.
MR. BOEHLER:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d shake his hand, but I’m not allowed to.  Times have changed, haven’t they?  Thank you very much.  You did a fantastic job.  We’re very proud of you — you and your whole team.  Thank you.
Today, we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available ventilators.  This afternoon, I met with the leaders — the top people of many of America’s big, powerful, beautiful, and, you know, very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today.  We had a great meeting, learned a lot.  And they’ve been going through a lot and they’ve been doing a fantastic job, as everybody here will attest.
I’m pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, so that we’re going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we’re able to help our states with at a later date if there’s ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again.  It was 1917, 1918.  That’s a long time ago.  We hope it never happens again.
And I’d like to ask Rick Pollack, CEO of American Hospital Association; Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare — that’s the largest in the United States; Warner Thomas, CEO of Ochsner Health.  And if I could, Mihal- — you — are you here from Cleveland Clinic?  Somebody?  Good.  Thank you.  Come on up, folks.  Please.
Thank you.  Say a few words please.
MR. POLLACK:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve program.  This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need.
You know, as this battle against this disease has affected the country a little bit unevenly, the rates of infection, hospitalization, and ICU use varies from one region to another.  In some places with lower infection rates, some ventilators may not be in use, while other areas are potentially stretched beyond their capacity.  The database of available ventilators that we are creating will allow us to flex so that we can make sure that available equipment can be shared with those in need.
We appreciate the leadership of the health systems that are here today that has stepped forward.  And Adam mentioned a few — I don’t know if he caught Dr. Fritz Francois from NYU Langone, and David Dill, the CEO of LifePoint, as well.
We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients.  We’ll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further.  Your team has provided us with important leadership, and we look forward to working with you in making this a success.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR. HAZEN:  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team.  I stand here before you, in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country.
One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID-19 battle was to find partnerships — partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and federal.  And we’re proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership, and I think it’s going to do great good for the community.
So thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you.
MR. THOMAS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s great to have Ochsner Health be part of this program.  We certainly have been a recipient, and the state of Louisiana has been a recipient of help getting ventilators to our state and Ochsner Health.
We’re currently taking care of about 60 percent of the COVID patients in New Orleans, and we did see a spike over the past few weeks.  But we’re starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction.
I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health a couple weeks ago.  We were running short on surgical gowns, and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us, and other hospitals around the New Orleans area.
So we’re excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, and we are proud to be part of that and help other communities around the country.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
DR. MIHALJEVIC:  Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation here.  On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a COVID pandemic.
In our home state of Ohio, with an early institution of social distancing, our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days.  Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with COVID infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System.
We’re also very grateful for the support from our state government, as well from our federal government.  This is a battle where we’re all in together.  We coordinate our efforts, share our resources, and work together as one.
I’m firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together.  Thank you very much for having us.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.
DR. MIHALJEVIC:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job.
That was a terrific meeting.  And thank you all for being here.  Thank you very much.
The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation.  We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is, compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain.  Think of that — 34.7, we have — and 6.6 the UK.  There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not in use at this moment.  They didn’t need them.  We got a lot of them out, and they didn’t need them.  And that’s a good thing that they didn’t need them.
But a lot of good brainpower was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions.  I want to thank our Vice President for the task force.  And I want to thank all members of your task force on having done an incredible job.  You really have done an incredible job.  Thank you, Mike, very much.
Through this new partnership with the hospitals, unused ventilators will voluntarily lend them.  Where they have unused ventilators, they will voluntary lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need.
Within the last several days, more than 20 of our nation’s largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them.  And I’ve been told that if they need more, there are more there.  We’re going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which is — which started, but will really start about less than a month.
We’re going to be helping other countries, and they need it very badly.  They have no chance without these ventilators.  They have to have ventilators.
As we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients.  It’s the first one.  These tests can be self-administered by patients in healthcare settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment.  Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily.
So, by using saliva — that’s a first — they’ll be able to do things, in terms of speed and ease, that we haven’t been able to do before.  So, a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time.  And that’s innovation.  I call it “innovation under pressure.”  There’s a big difference.  “Innovation under pressure.”  Right?  Cleveland Clinic knows all about that.
As we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker.  There’s tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration’s efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it’s going to roar once it gets open.  I think it’s going to go up tremendously.
You see what’s happening with the stock market already, because a lot of the very smart financial people — the great minds — they’re looking at the stock and they’re saying, “Wow.”  Because they really — what they’re really seeing is how we’re doing.  If we weren’t doing well, the market wouldn’t be at a level that it is today.  They have a lot of confidence that we’re doing the right thing and that our country is going to be open soon and our country is going to be booming.
We’ve had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going.  So I thank them for wanting to contribute.  And we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders, seeking their input on how we can return to what was, until very recently, the greatest economy anywhere in the world — and I can say the greatest economy in the history of the world.  There’s never been an economy like we had.
Just a little bit more than a month ago, we set every record you could set: more people working than we’ve ever had working before — almost 160 million; the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had; and the best employment numbers we’ve ever had.  Everybody was doing well.  Stock market at a record — 142 days it hit a record.  And I think we’re going to top those records, okay?  And I think we’re going to top them soon, once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen.
The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized, and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody.  I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly.  And I will then be authorizing each individual governor, of each individual state, to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate.
The day will be very close because certain states, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other states.  It’s going to be very, very close.  Maybe even before the date of May 1st.  So that will be for some states.  Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape.  And we think we’re going to be able to get them open fairly quickly, and then others will follow.
The federal government will be watching them very closely, and we’ll be there to help.  We’ll be there to help in many different ways, as we’ve been — where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody has ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody has ever seen before.  Nobody can even believe.
Other foreign countries — even powerful countries — can’t believe what we were able to do with ventilators.  Big, powerful countries.  Big producing countries can’t believe what we were able to do.  We will hold the governors accountable.  But again, we’re going to be working with them to make sure it works really well.
Now, we have a list of people that I’ll be speaking to over the next very short period of time — in many cases, tomorrow.  We’re going to have elected officials, and we’ll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours.  But we have a list of different industries that I’ll be discussing by — meeting by telephone, because we don’t want people traveling right now: the American Farm Bureau Federation — Zippy Duvall, Cisco Systems, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Corteva, Tractor Supply Company, Seaboard Corporation, Grimmway Farms, Mountaire Farms, and others in the agricultural business
In banking, it’s: Bank of America — Brian Moynihan has been great; JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon; Goldman Sachs; Citigroup; Wells Fargo; U.S. Bancorp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman; Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bancorp — all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas.
And if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible.  And I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers.  I hope they’re able to get that done very quickly because it’s been an incredible success, and many are already spending that money, and the money has been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time.  It was only a week ago.  But a lot of money has been distributed already.  It’s going to keep our small businesses open.
The construction labor workforce: International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey.  These are a lot of friends of mine.  The Laborers’ International Union of North America, Terry O’Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel; Fluor; National Association of Homebuilders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO; G.H. Palmer.  So these are some of the unions — pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line.
In defense, we have: Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman.  These are all the top of each company — CEOs, chairmans, presidents.  Raytheon, General Dynamics.
Energy — we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend.  It finished with tremendous credit going to Russia and Saudi Arabia.  And it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day are cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that’s been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50 percent of the business.  It’s been an amazing achievement.  Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made.  Maybe the biggest oil deal ever made, they’re saying.  I didn’t know that.
But we were involved in getting that done, and it was very important.  We’re going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry — Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy states.  It’s great.  So we’re very happy about it.  I want to thank everybody.  We had the — it’s called OPEC Plus.  That’s OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC.
And I also want to thank the President of Mexico because he was — he was terrific.  He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done.  I want to thank him very much.
On the energy front, we had: Exxon Mobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan; Hess Corporation, Pearl Group, and a few others.  Big ones.  Great ones.
Financial services, we have: Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson & Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliott Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; MasterCard; Visa; Chubb; Sequoia; Stephens, Warren Stevens — great; Charles Schwab, Chuck Schwab, who will be here by phone.
Food and beverage: National Restaurant Association; McDonald’s; Darden Restaurants; Coca-Cola; Pepsi Cola; Chick-fil-A; Subway; Bloomin’ Brands; Yum! Brands; Papa John’s; Wendy’s; Waffle House; Starbucks; Wolfgang Puck; Thomas Keller; Jean-Georges, my friend Jean-Georges; and Daniele.  You know them.
From the transportation world: FedEx, Fred Smith; Allegiant; United Airlines, Oscar Munoz; UPS, David Abney; J.B. Hunt; YRC Worldwide; Crowley Maritime — incredible, big, powerful shippers and transportation companies.
In telecommunications, we have: the legendary John Malone of Liberty Media; Verizon; T-Mobile; Charter Communications; and Brian Roberts of Comcast.  Thank you all very much.
Healthcare: New York Presbyterian, Jerry Speyer — a friend of mine; HCA Healthcare, Sam Hazen.  Thank you, Sam.  Just met with Sam.  Ascension Health, CommonSpirit Health, Community Health Systems, Trinity Health, Cardinal Health, McKesson, 3M.  Thank you, Mike Roman, for helping us with face masks.  It worked out well for everybody.  Procter and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific — they’ve been helping us incredibly with testing.  Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche — and Roche has been fantastic on testing, the job they’ve done.  I have to call them out.  They have really — they have stepped up like very few.  Anthem; United Health Group; Aetna; Cigna; and Humana — all the big ones.
The tech companies — we have the right ones: Apple, we have Tim Cook; Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar; Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz; Salesforce, Marc Benioff; SAP — SAP, Jen Morgan; Microsoft, Satya — great job he’s done.  Thank you, Satya.  Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg; IBM; Intel; Qualcomm; Cisco; Advanced Micro Devices; Broadcom.  Incredible companies.  Companies that no other country will catch, if they’re smart.  They have to be smart.
But I’ve dealt with a lot of different countries and I will say that no — the respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies — there’s nobody even close to our tech companies.  They can’t catch them.  So they try and buy them, but we sort of put an end to a lot of that.
In sports — we want to get our sports back, so importantly.  These will be some separate calls.  Some will be together, by the way — lists — and some will be separate.  But we have to get our sports back.  I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.  But I haven’t actually had too much time to watch.  I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work.
The NBA — Adam Silver.  The Major League Baseball — we miss our base- — well, this is baseball season right here.  Rob Manfred, thank you very much.  NFL — Roger Goodell.  Thank you, Roger.  UFC, Dana White.  Great Dana White.  PGA, Jay Monahan; LPGA, Michael Whan; USDA, Patrick Galbraith.  Major League Soccer, Don Garber; WWE, the great Vince McMahon; NASCAR, Lesa Kennedy.  Thank you, Lesa.  NHL, Gary Bettman; from the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft; Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones; Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban.
And some of the thought leaders that we’re going to have — and there’s some others that we are having; we’re just waiting to hear.  But everybody’s saying yes, I must say.  John Allison; Heritage Foundation, Kay Coles James — great person.  Hoover Institute, Condoleezza Rice — another great person.  Art Laffer; Steve Moore; Steve Forbes; Larry Lindsey; Katherine Reynolds; Scott Gottlieb — just spoke with Scott; Jim DeMint — and Jim has been a terrific friend; Bill Haggerty; and Ray Washburne.
And religious leaders will be coming on Friday.  We’ll be speaking to — and we’re going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders.  We have incredible people and they want to — they want to be a part.  And we’ll be talking about churches and we’ll be talking about opening.  And we’ll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me.  We’re going to find out how we’re doing in that regard.
So those are the names that we have on our list.  They’re the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest.  And they’re going to give us some ideas.  But we’re all set, as I said.  The governors are going to be opening up their states.  They’re going to declare when — they’re going to know when.  Some can open very, very shortly — if not almost immediately.  We’ll give a date.  But the date is going to be in the very near future.
So we’ll get it open.  Individual states will — and the governors will be held accountable.  If they need things, we’ll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing.  We want them — because they’re equipped to do testing.  We’ve created incredible tests and we’ve done more testing than anybody has ever done in the world right now.  And we — we had a broken system and now we have a great system.  We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, “We want to get some of those tests.”
I want to thank Abbott, because Abbott came up with the first simpler tests.  The first one was rough.  If you were — I think it was more of an operation than a test.  (Laughter.)  The first one was — for anybody that took it, it was not easy.  But now we have a very simple test with Abbott.  Now we have saliva, we have lots of other things that are happening.  But we have millions of tests.
The governors are responsible.  They have to take charge.  They have to do a great job.  And we’re going to suggest that they check people, through tests or otherwise, coming into their states and they run their states very strong.  Eventually, we won’t have to do that.  Eventually, this will be gone.  But, for a while, we’re going to do it.  So they’re going to take charge — at their borders, they’re going to take charge of people coming in.  And maybe, to an extent, depending on what they work out with their nearby state, it may be also people leaving.  And they’ll be able to do that very shortly.
We’ll be announcing a date, but it’ll be very short.  And, frankly, it’ll be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed — the end of April.  So we think that some of the governors will be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that.  We’ll speak to them.  But we’re all set and we’re counting on the governors to do a great job.
Others are going to have to take a longer period of time until they’re in a position to say, “We’re ready to go.”  And that’s okay.  We understand that.  Some of the governors have a very tough situation.  But in almost all cases, it’s all starting to come down.  We’re very proud of the job everybody has done.
And if you look at the numbers — so the minimum, as you — as portrayed — Deborah is here.  Dr. Birx has been fantastic.  The minimum was 100,000 deaths.  And I hope to be substantially under the minimum, meaning we all hope — Mike, right? — we all hope to be substantially under.
We did the right thing because, otherwise, it would have been — the projections are 2 million people.  The actual projection was 2.2 million people.  And if you cut it in half, that would be 1.1 million people.  That’s many more.  That’s double the Civil War.  And if you cut that in half, you’re talking 5- or 600,000 people.  That’s what we lost in the Civil War.  And that’s cutting it, cutting it, cutting it.  And we’re not going to — that would not be acceptable.  It would not be acceptable.  Nothing is — one life isn’t acceptable, but we weren’t given that option.
So I’m confident that these respected people that I just read from the list will give us some great ideas, in addition to what the governors have learned.  The governors have learned a lot.  I’ve spoken to governors that, at the beginning, it was a contentious relationship, and now it’s a very friendly relationship and a really great relationship.  And I’m proud to say that some of them, I think, are friends.  In some cases, they’re Democrats, but I think they like me, and I actually like them.  I’ll tell you who they are someday.
But we’re all getting along and we all want to do the right thing.  And I think they’re going to do a great job of leading their individual states.  It’ll be a beautiful thing to watch.  They’ll go and rely on their mayors and their local town officials.  They bring it right down.
And Washington shouldn’t be doing that.  We can’t be thinking about a Walmart parking lot that’s 2,000 miles away where we’re doing testing, but a governor of a state can, and a mayor can, and right down the line.  So it’s going to be — I think it’s going to be a terrific system.  And if we’re unhappy with the state, we’re going to let them know we’re unhappy.  And if they’re not doing the job and they can’t get the job done, and, for some reason, things are happening that we’re not going to like — like the numbers are heading in a wrong direction — we’ll have to do something that’s very ser- — very serious.  We’ll have to, maybe, close them up and start all over again.  But I don’t think we’re going to have to do that.
I think the governors are going to come out at a time that — and these will be individual dates.  And the governors are going to come out at a time when they’re ready.  Some can come out very, very shortly.  And we look forward to watching that process.  So I think it’s going to be a very beautiful process.
Our discussions will focus with the people that we’re dealing with on rejuvenating the economy, and always health.  Always health.  Health and life.  Living is number one.  But the rejuvenated economy — and I think it’s going to go quickly.
We’ll be utilizing our robust testing capacity for the governors.  We’ll be giving them what they need, if they don’t have it themselves.  We hope, by now, they’ll be able to have it themselves.  We were hoping they would have had it themselves early on, but they weren’t.  But such great advances have been made.  So we’ll be dealing with them on that.
And we — they can rely on us very strongly.  They’re going to be relying on us, I think, for some help.  And we’re there — whether it’s building hospital beds, which I don’t think they’re going to need.  You look at Javits Center — a great, great job that the Army Corps of Engineers did; FEMA got involved.  We actually ended up sending our medical people.  That was not a COVID-19 center, and they asked, “Could you do that?”
And then even after we did that, it was not used very much, meaning they didn’t have to use it nearly to the extent that they thought when they conceived it.  It wasn’t that they made a mistake; nobody made a mistake.  We built it — I’d rather have too much than too little.  Err on the side of caution.  And it’s really incredible what they did, including the two ships — the two great ships.
And I just want to thank a lot of really great people, a lot of great politicians.  And, again, we’re going to be announcing the political list tomorrow.  And on there, we’re going to have a lot of senators.
And we’re going to be having a meeting with the governors probably on Thursday — a meeting by teleconference.  And a lot of things will be discussed and some of the details will be discussed.  But we want them to do an incredible job of running their states.  I think they’ll do an incredible job too.  After having gotten to know so many of them, I think each one of them will do an incredible job.
And, again, the federal government is there.  We have ventilators if they need them.  We have beds if they need them.  We have hospitals if they need them.  We have a testing capacity that’s now second to none.  We’re — again, other countries are calling us.  Countries that you thought were doing well are calling us for help on testing.  So we’re there to help.
And, with that, if you have a few questions, we’ll take them.  And if not, that would be okay too.
Yeah, go ahead please.  Jeff?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing/

April 13, 2020
5:49 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet.  We’re speaking with the governors and representatives.  FEMA is already on its way, and they got there — as soon as we heard the word, I said, “Get out there.”  So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does.  It’s, really, something very special.
So we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we’re with you all the way.  It’s a tough deal.  That was a bad, bed level five.  That was a bad group.  That’s as high as it gets.  It was a bad grouping of tornadoes.  Something that’s something incredible, the power — the horrible, destructive power.
America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus.  Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide.  Flat.  Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana.  This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines.  It’s been incredible what they’ve done.
You looked at the charts, and the charts are — and the models from early on — predictions were 100 [thousand] and 120,000 people look like.  If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish.  And we’re going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number.  So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it’s still just a horrible thing all over the world.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.
This is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning.  We appreciate it so much.  In fact, Dr. Fauci is here.  Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further.
Thank you very much.  Tony, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Just one — a couple of things, and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday.
You’re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we’ve been talking about and how things are starting to balance off.  And I think the more, as we go by each day, I think we’re going to see — and again, I never like to get ahead of myself or of Dr. Birx, but it looks like even though we’ve had a really bad week last week — remember, when I was speaking to you before, I was saying this was really a bad week — there’s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we’re starting to see in some areas now that kind of flattening, particularly in a place that was a hotspot like New York.  That’s the first thing.
The second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning, for about an hour, and they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range, about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, but specifically African American.
And, I mean, I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are, to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification, where proper and where appropriate, to isolate and contact trace if we can, but also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately.
So I just wanted to get that out of the way.
The other point I wanted to make is that I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question.  And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it’s what “would have” or “could have.”  The nature of the hypothetical question was: If, in fact, we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved?  And the answer to my question was, as I always do — and I’m doing right now — perfectly honestly say, “yes.”  I mean, obviously.  If you — mitigation helps.
I’ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works.  So if mitigation works, and you instigated and — you initiated earlier, you will probably have saved more lives.  If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives, if you initiated at a certain time.
That was taken as a way that maybe, somehow, something was at fault here.
So let me tell you from my experience — and I can only speak from my own experience — is that we had been talking, before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness or not, of strong mitigations.  So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean.
The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to actually have a, quote, “shutdown” in the sense of — not really “shutdown” but to really have strong mitigation, we discussed it.  Obviously, there would be concern by some that, in fact, that might have some negative consequences.  Nonetheless, the President listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.
The next second time that I went with Dr. Birx in — to the President and said, “Fifteen days are not enough.  We need to go thirty days,” obviously, there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects.  Nonetheless, at that time, the President went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days.
So I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were.  But, clearly, as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn’t have the chance to clarify.
Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-25/

1:52 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody, and good afternoon.  Today is Good Friday.  And this Sunday, millions of Christians celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  At this holy time, we pray that God will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes.  As American families look forward to Easter, we’re reminded that our story ends not in despair, but in triumph and renewal.  Very appropriate, isn’t it?
I’d like to provide Americans an update on our ongoing efforts in the war against the invisible enemy.  Before I do that, I’ll have a couple of notes.  The United States, in discussions last night with Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and –dealing with OPEC nations — we are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, “over the barrel.”  And Mexico is committing to do 100,000 fewer barrels.
The President and I spoke last night.  We have a great relationship, great friendship.  They’re helping us very much at the border.  They have 27,000 soldiers — Mexican soldiers — on our border right now, stopping people from coming into our country as our wall goes up.  We’re up to about 168 miles of wall.
And in speaking with the President, they have a limit.  The OPEC nations have agreed to a different limit: a reduction of about 23 percent.  So what I thought I would do — and I don’t know that it’s going to be accepted; we’ll find out — the United States will help Mexico along and they’ll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they’re prepared to do so.
And we had a great conversation, but we’ll find out how that all works out.  As you know, they’re trying to get rid of the glut of oil.  There’s a tremendous glut of oil.  And we don’t want anything to hurt our incredible industry.  We’re actually the largest producer in the world now, so we don’t want anything to hurt those jobs — those great jobs in Texas and North Dakota, in Oklahoma, and everywhere.  We have a tremendous energy — New Mexico — tremendous energy business.  And we want to keep those jobs.
So we’re — we’re working on it.  I think, eventually, it’s going to work out.  It may work out quicker than what most people thought possible.  And maybe it won’t, but it’ll work out eventually.
Our experts are monitoring the data from every part of our country having to do with the topic that we’re here to discuss.  In the midst of grief and pain, we’re seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives.  Tremendous progress is being made.  Although when you look at some of the numbers — I just spoke with Governor Cuomo; we had a good talk.  When you look at those numbers — the numbers of death, people that have died — it’s so horrible.
Now, on the other side, you have the numbers of beds being used, we were just saying, are substantially reduced.  That’s usually the sign that it’s heading in the downward curve.  So, New York, we know where that is.  But in the midst of all this grief and this pain, we’re seeing these signs and we’re seeing them very strongly.  And a lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives.  We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been.
So, nobody knows what the number is, but we had a number of 100,000 lives.  As many as that is, it’s impossible to even think of it.  And that was the low end with a tremendous amount of work and a tremendous amount of — you can call it many different things.  Our people had to be extremely strong and brave to be able to put up with what they’ve put up with.  But the minimum, if you did this social distancing at every other aspect — and I think I can say 90 percent, maybe even more than that, were able to do it — the minimum number was 100,000 lives, and I think we’ll be substantially under that number.
Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 — you could never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking.  So they said between 100- and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything.  But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people of this country.
So we’ll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we’re headed to a number substantially below the 100,000.  That would be the low mark.  And I hope that bears out.
The situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing.  Detroit has really started to go up, and now it is stabilizing.  And New Orleans is a great place; I have so many friends there.  They can’t believe what’s happening, but it’s really stabilized.  I spoke with the governor of Louisiana.  And, as you know, we’re building them additional beds right now — the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA — and that is going to be done.  And I hope they’re not going to be very well used because I think they’ve really — I don’t think they’re going to need them or certainly not very many of them.  We built them a big hospital of 1,000 beds and now we’re — we’re in the midst of doing another 1,000.  I don’t think they’re going to be using very many of them, and that’s a good thing.
There was a time, two weeks ago, where we said, “That’s not going to be nearly enough.  We’re going to have to build more.”  But we wanted to wait to see and I’m glad we waited.  It just looks like they’re doing really well.  Louisiana and the state of Michigan is doing, really, much better than we thought.
In Washington State, we’ve made enough progress that the governor is now able to return an Army field hospital, so we’re going to take that hospital.  We don’t think we need any more hospitals.  We built thousands of beds all over the country, and we think we’re probably not going to need that hospital anyway.  And if we do, we’re ready to move it to a different location.
In New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially, as I said.  And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working.
Over time, our guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions.  And we’re seeing that; it’s incredible.  I think, with no exceptions, it’s looking like it’s lower.  And again, that’s because of the people doing what they had to do.  Great people.  And working with elected representatives and — and the doctors, the nurses, and everybody — I mean, just everybody.  Everybody is so, so — has been so amazing.
I was told this morning again, “Please mention all of those people working in the grocery stores.”  And it’s true.  The checkouts and the clerks and the people that are really — and a number of those people have become infected.  So we want to thank them and a shout-out to them.
With the tireless devotion of American doctors and nurses and all of the medical people, we’ve kept our fatality rate very, very low compared to other countries.  My administration is closely monitoring the data on the virus’s impact on our cherished African American communities because they’ve been hit hard.  And the Surgeon General will be sharing more of that information right after we’re finished here.  He’ll be coming up and saying exactly what’s happening because it’s really — it’s very troublesome, I will tell you that.
I’d also like to provide clarity on the important point for many Americans on elective surgeries.  While we’ve asked hospitals to cancel surgeries and procedures that do not take place at this time, just not to do them now — the choice to delay any treatment still remains between the patient and their doctor.  We’re not advising Americans to postpone medical treatment that the doctor believes should occur now.  So it’s different kinds of surgery, obviously, but we’re really getting to the point where you can start to think about doing that surgery, if necessary, pretty soon, I think.  Pretty soon.
Yesterday, I directed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny to — Sonny Perdue to expedite aid to American farmers.  And Secretary Perdue will be using all of the tools at his disposal to develop a program — and very quickly — of at least $16 billion to provide relief for farmers, ranchers, and producers impacted by the coronavirus.
In this time of crisis, we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning — right from beginning to end.  And we’re committed to supporting the amazing men and women who produce supply.  I did, last night, a statement on social media, and I said I have directed Secretary Sonny Perdue to expedite help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are very, very badly hurting right now.  I expect Secretary Perdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable and safe, and our great farmers are prosperous and continue to be prosperous.
We’re working very hard to make sure our food supply chain is sound and plentiful, but we all know that that begins with our farmers, cattlemen, ranchers, and producers.  So we’re going to be working with the small farmers, the big farmers, the cattlemen, the ranchers — all of the producers.   We’re going to take care of them.  We’re working with them right now.  We have a lot of money that was put there through our use of tariffs and other means, and we’re going to help out our farmers.
And I don’t think — I tell you, I’ve been helping our farmers for a couple of years because they were targeted, as you know, by China and others.  And I think they’re very grateful to what — for what we’ve done.
On the medical front, the FDA — FDA has issued 47 emergency use authorizations for advancements and testing new ventilator designs, innovations, and personal protective equipment, and experimental medicines.  And Dr. Hahn is going to be talking about that.  We’ve cut through the red tape to give doctors and patients unprecedented freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, granting access to potential therapies and drugs.
Since Monday, we’ve deployed two major shipments of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile.  And it’s going to various cities.
And we are also disposing and getting, as quickly as we can, portions of it to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.  And speaking of the Department of Defense, they’re going to be sending us 10 million N95 masks that they had.  And we’re in great shape in every way.  We’re in great shape with ventilators.  We’re in great shape with protective clothing.  We have additional planeloads coming in.
But we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment.  I can speak, I think for — Vice President Pence will be talking in a little while.  We’re getting — we’re getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything.  They’re in great shape for this surge that’s coming in certain areas in particular, and that’s a good job.  You’ve done a great job on that, Mike.  Really, a great job.  I appreciate it.  The whole country appreciates it.
More than 2 million coronavirus tests have now been completed, and we’re conducting approximately 100,000 more every day.  We’re also working to bring blood-based serology tests to the market as quickly as possible so that Americans can determine whether or not they have already had the virus and potentially have immunity.
They have immunity if they’ve had the virus.  A lot of them don’t even know if they’ve had it.  Sometimes it’s brutal.  You see the Prime Minister seems to be doing well now, I hope.  He had a rough go of it, and still is, but he’s doing better.  And then some people don’t even know they had it.  It could be sniffles.  It could be they don’t feel perfect, but they’ve had it.  And they’re the lucky ones.
The NIH, CDC, and FDA are currently validating these antibody tests to ensure that they are accurate, and they’re doing that at breakneck speed.  I think we can say that, Doctor.  And we’re going to get them approved very quickly — Dr. Hahn.
When validated, we’re confident that the production will scale up to tens of millions of tests very quickly.  We’re leading the world now in testing, by far, and we’re going to keep it that way.  Other countries are coming to us, and they’re wanting to know about our tests and can they buy the tests, and can they do whatever they have to do to get the tests.  And we’re going to make that — very soon, we’ll be in a position to make that possible because it’s important for them to have it.
And we’re going to have an announcement on the World Health Organization sometime next week.  As you know, we give them approximately $500 million a year, and we’re going to be talking about that subject next week.  We’ll have a lot to say about it.  We’ll hold it.
Every American should be proud of what our country has achieved in just a short period of time.  The U.S. military has deployed thousands of personnel to build 23 temporary hospitals with more than 16,000 beds.  And we have the potential to build many more if we needed them, but we’re all ready to go.  But I don’t think we’re going to need them, which is great — great news.
And we built those hospitals in 12 states and the District of Columbia using the Defense Production Act.  And we used it like a hammer.  A lot of the media said: Oh, we weren’t using it.  We used it like a hammer to a point where all we had to do was say the words and everybody gave us max.  And they’ve done a good job.  They really have done a good job, with few exceptions.
And we’ve harnessed the full power of American industry to produce ventilators and other essential supplies.  Right now, we’re making thousands of ventilators, many of which we won’t need, but we’ll use them in our stockpile.  And we’ll build that up.  We’ll also help build up the stockpiles, which they should have had in the states.  And so we’re working with governors on that, and we’ll also help other countries or countries that are calling us for help, if they need ventilators and they’re in no no position to build ventilators.  We are.  We have Ford and General Motors, and many, many companies are building ventilators.
So we’re going to be helping — at a not-too-distant point, we’re going to be helping quite a few of the countries.
Now, we’ve launched Project Airbridge to deliver nearly 300 million pieces of personal protective equipment from and around the globe.  We’re also shipping out 60 sterilization systems to 10 different cities that can each sterilize up to 80,000 masks each day, and I’m even hearing it can go up to 120,000 masks a day — certain equipment with certain additions.  It’s a company in Ohio that makes it.  It’s a great company.  Great — I hear it’s a great product.  It works very well.
I asked that question; I said, “How come we have to buy so many masks?  Why can’t we sterilize the masks that are being used?”  And the answer was, “You can.”  In this case, they say, up to 20 times.  So we can take a mask — certain types of masks — the N95s in particular — and we can sterilize them, make them very clean, up to 20 times.  That’s a great thing.
In addition, we passed the largest emergency economic relief package in American history to save the U.S. economy and protect the American worker.  As you know, this past week, which was four active days on the stock market — Good Friday today is not — is not included; the markets are closed.  In four days, we had the biggest market increase — stock market increase that we’ve had in 50 years.  That tells you that there’s a pent-up demand.  That tells you they want to get back.  There’s something good going to happen.  I really believe that.  There’s something very good going to happen.  We have to get back.
So think of it: In this horrible period, this horrible, dark period where this — this monster came and worked its horrible, horrible spell over the world — 184 countries as of this morning.  A hundred and eighty-four countries.
We’ve done well, and I guess the market thinks we’ve done well, because we hit the biggest stock market increase without one day — we’re talking four days instead of five — that we’ve had in 50 years.  Fifty years.  Think of that.  More than 50 years, actually.
In short, the American people have launched the greatest mobilization of our society since World War Two, deploying every scientific, governmental, medical, and military resource to defeat the virus.
So I want to just start then with — we’re going to answer questions later.  We’ll have time.  I think we have a lot of time today.  A lot of people are off, as they should be.  Good Friday.
But — so I’ll stick around, and we’ll answer questions later.  I want to start with Deborah Birx, please.  Dr. Birx.  And you can go over some of the numbers we just looked at, and that’d be great.
Thank you very much, Deborah.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for outlining how well we are doing in a series of metro areas.  What also has been encouraging, for those of you who are watching epidemic curves every day — and I’m sure you are, and lot — watching them in log phase, because that’s how epidemiologists like to look at their curves — you can see for the first time that, in the United States, we’re starting to level on the logarithmic phase, like Italy did about a week ago.  And so this gives us great heart on that — not only in specific places, but we’re starting to see that change.
Obviously, a lot of that is driven by the improvement in New York City.  Remember, for a long time, they were over 50 percent of our cases and 50 percent of our new cases.  That has dramatically changed because of the impact of what the citizens of New York and New Jersey and across Connecticut, and now Rhode Island, are doing to really change the course of this pandemic and really change the trajectory of new cases.
We’re seeing that what many states and metro areas were — experienced as twofold and fourfold — fourfold increases that went to twofold — that now those are going to eight days between the doubling rate.  Watching this every day gives us hope across these metro areas, from New York and New Jersey and all through Denver, and of course, through New Orleans.
We still see cases occurring in the Boston area and in Chicago, but their rate of increase seems to be stabilizing.  And we really want to call out the work of the mayors of Baltimore and the District and Philadelphia who have really brought all of their health — health experts together and, working with their communities, are starting to really change the curves in those areas.
What we’re seeing is we’re united in social distancing, and that’s been very encouraging to all of us, and it should be encouraging to the healthcare providers that are on the frontline, many of which are serving our Americans with such dignity and respect and ensuring that everybody gets optimal care.
And as the President noted, our mortality in the United States is significantly less than many of the other countries when you correct them for our population.  And that is really solely the work of our health — our frontline healthcare providers.
And so working with — you can really — hopefully you get the theme today that we are incredibly proud of our public health leaders at the city level, at the state level, at the federal level who are working together to really change the course of this pandemic, working with their citizens in their communities to make these changes, and the American public who has really taken all of this to heart and stayed home.
I know, last week, we really asked a lot of people in the Washington and Baltimore area to consolidate, not go out frequently to grocery stores or pharmacies.  You can really see that that’s having a huge impact.
So it’s really about the encouraging signs that we see.  But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak.  And so, every day, we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that’s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.
We continue to really applaud the work of California and Washington State and Oregon.  We’re learning from all three of those states, from their public health officials, about how they were able to keep the virus from ever becoming logarithmic.  And I think that’s an important lesson for all of us on how they did that, what the timing was, in case we ever have to face this issue in the future.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Tony?
THE PRESIDENT:  Doctor, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  So again, just keeping on the theme that Dr. Birx had mentioned, this is the end of the week — that famous week that we spoke about last weekend — in which we — what actually was predicted to happen, happened.  We’re starting to see the leveling off and the coming down that Dr. Birx had mentioned.
But it’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all.  I was actually hearkened [sic] by the fact that we’ve been talking about the New York, New Jersey, New Orleans, and other areas where they have really big spikes, but there’s other parts of the country, in the middle parts of the country, where they’re concerned to make sure they don’t get those spikes.
And I really want to salute the governors of states throughout the entire United States, but particularly in the central part of the country because the governors after they see us in these press conferences.  And I’ve had calls over the last several days from several of the governors — you know, from Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah.  Just about an hour and a half ago, I spoke with the governors of Arkansas and Wyoming, who are really committed to make sure that they don’t get into the situation where they’re going to have spikes in their state.  And they’re doing the kinds of things that they don’t get recognized, because people don’t talk about them much.
But we have a big country.  We have 50 states.  And it’s not only the big cities.  So if we’re going to pull out of this, we’re going to pull out of it in the big cities and we’re going to pull out in those areas that aren’t as densely populated.
And I just want to give a shout out to them.  They’re doing an extraordinary job.  I was really pleasant- — I wouldn’t say “surprised,” because I expect it of this country — but to hear what they’re doing and the commitment that they’re putting into making sure that we don’t have the kinds of situations that we’ve experienced, unfortunately, in other areas — this is very important.
I just want to close by — one other thing, something I mentioned yesterday and the day before — that there are a lot of candidate interventions that are going into clinical trials.  For those of you who are interested in it, I recommend you go to ClinicalTrials.gov, and you’ll see the design of a clinical trial, and you’ll see that many of them are the randomized control trials that are the really gold standard of how you find out whether something really is safe and effective.  And as the weeks and months — and it’ll probably be months — sometime in the summer, we’ll start to see which are working, which are not.  And to focus on those that are — we’re developing and we’re working.
I’ll be happy to answer questions later.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Please, Doctor.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
DR. HAHN:  The White House Task Force has been very focused on increasing the supply of personal protective equipment for our great providers.  I was one of those providers a few months ago and I can tell you nothing is more important than making sure they have what they need.
So, in order to increase the supply of N95 masks, FDA has worked with industry and has now authorized two companies who will supply machines to sterilize N95 masks.
Admiral Polowczyk and FEMA are purchasing, on behalf of U.S. government, 60 sterilization machines, as mentioned by the President.  And they will be positioned around the country to increase the amount of supply of N95 masks.
Each machine will be able to sterilize 80,000 95 masks [sic] — N95 masks per day.  And we hope to actually increase that further.
The Vice President and the White House Task Force challenged us yesterday, and we responded as a team.  FDA issued revised guidance regarding the laundering of gowns because gowns are another issue, in terms of supply, that we’re looking forward on.
This is not something that normally happens around the country, but issued this guidance.  It’s on our website now at FDA.  So there’s information about how hospitals can do that to increase the supply.
We’ve heard concerns that maybe hospitals might not want to do that because of regulations.  And I can — happy to tell you that Administrator Verma and I have worked on this — certified providers and suppliers who follow FDI [sic] — FDA guidance, as posted on the website, will be compliant with Medicare and Medicaid requirements.
And then finally, last week FDA provided guidance to manufacturers on manufacturing specifications for cloth gowns.  This is another attempt to increase the number of gowns.  Typically, it’s plastic or other types of materials.  And this guidance, if followed, can be used by manufacturers to actually make these gowns and no further regulatory red tape will be necessary.  They can go into circulation.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Please.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Thank you, Mr.  President.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I started off the week talking about the challenges that lie ahead, and I want to finish the week just by reiterating what you’ve heard.  Mitigation works.  It definitively and quantitatively is working.  And I want to say thank you to America for your efforts to help flatten the curve and to save lives.
But, at the President’s direction, yesterday, I met with 2,000 Hispanic leaders from their communities.  And today, the Vice President led a phone call that I was on with hundreds of African American leaders, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, including Derrick Johnson of the NAACP, including the National Medical Association and the Black Nurses Association, to talk about some of the alarming trends we’re observing regarding the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color.
And you’ve heard the stats in New York City: Hispanics represent the majority of deaths.  In Milwaukee County, blacks are 25 percent of the population but almost 50 percent of the cases and 75 percent of the deaths.  So what’s going on?  Well, it’s alarming but it’s not surprising that people of color have a greater burden of chronic health conditions.
African Americans and Native Americans develop high blood pressure at much younger ages, and it’s less likely to be under control, and does greater harm to their organs.  Puerto Ricans have higher rates of asthma and black boys are three times as likely to die of asthma as their white counterparts.  As a matter of fact, I’ve been carrying around an inhaler in my pocket for 40 years out of fear of having a fatal asthma attack.  And I hope that showing you this inhaler shows little kids with asthma all across the country that they can grow up to be Surgeon General one day.
But I — more immediately share it so that everyone knows it doesn’t matter if you look fit, if you look young.  You are still at risk for getting and spreading and dying from coronavirus.
The chronic burden of medical ills is likely to make people of color especially less resilient to the ravages of COVID-19.  And it’s possibly — in fact, likely — that the burden of social ills is also contributing.
Social distancing and teleworking, we know, are critical, and you’ve heard Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci talk about how they prevent the spread of coronavirus.  Yet only one in five African Americans and one in six Hispanics has a job that lets them work from home.
People of color are more likely to live in densely packed areas and in multi-generational housing, which — situations which create higher risk for spread of a highly contagious disease like COVID-19.
We tell people to wash their hands, but as studies showed, 30 percent of the homes on Navajo Nation don’t have running water.  So how are they going to do that?
In summary, people of color experience both more likely exposure to COVID-19 and increased complications from it.  But let me be crystal clear: We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically predisposed to get COVID-19.  There is nothing inherently wrong with you.  But they are socially predisposed to coronavirus dispos- — exposure and to have a higher incidence of the very diseases that puts you at risk for severe complications of coronavirus.
But as the Vice President shared on the call this morning, this history — and I want you to hear me say this — it does not have to be our nation’s future.  We’re taking steps now, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach, protect, and strengthen all communities impacted by this disease, and especially our communities of color.
More details will be forthcoming.  But we are actively working, as the Vice President and the CDC director laid out today, on data collection; targeted outreach to communities of color; and increasing financial employment, education, housing, social and health supports, so that everybody has an equal chance to be healthy.
And I want to close by saying that while your state and local health departments and those of us in public service are working day and night to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect you regardless of your color, your creed, or your geography, I need you to know: You are not helpless.  And it’s even more important that, in communities of color, we adhere to the task force guidelines to slow the spread.
Stay at home, if possible.  If you must go out, maintain six feet of distance between you and everyone else, and wear a mask if you’re going to be within six feet of others.  Wash your hands more often than you ever dreamed possible.  Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.  And call your friends and family.  Check in on your mother; she wants to hear from you right now.
And speaking of mothers, we need you to do this, if not for yourself, then for your abuela.  Do it for your granddaddy.  Do it for your Big Mama.  Do it for your Pop-Pop.  We need you to understand — especially in communities of color, we need you to step up and help stop the spread so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable.
This epidemic is a tragedy, but it will be all the more tragic if we fail to recognize and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and an array of other diseases and risk factors on communities of color.  The task force and this administration are determined not to let that happen.  The President, the Vice President have said we will not let that happen.
We can’t fix these issues overnight, but I promise you we will work with your communities to quickly and meaningfully move the needle in the right direction.  Nothing less than the fate of our families and friends, my family and friends depends on it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Thank you.
Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met and — and heard from the President the gratitude then he and I and I know all the American people feel for all the dedicated workers at FEMA, HHS, U.S. Public Health Service, FDA, and all those that are literally working on your behalf around the clock to partner with states, to partner with local health officials.  And Mr. President, allow me to add my — my thanks and admiration to all of the entire team here at the federal level.
On this Good Friday, we — we remember those who’ve lost their lives to the coronavirus.  We remember their families, our dedicated healthcare workers, and our first responders.  And we do well, on this special day for Christians across this country, to remember them in our prayers.
But, as you just heard from Dr. Birx and from the experts, it’s also a good day to remember that Good Friday is always followed by Easter Sunday.  And there is hope.  There is hope in this moment that, thanks to what the American people are doing every day — adhering to the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America; thanks to the fact that Americans are listening to state and local leaders, and putting the health of their family members and neighbors first, we’re getting there, America.  We’re making progress.  But it’s imperative that we all continue to implement all of the guidance in the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”
As the Surgeon General just attested, at the President’s direction, we engaged more than 400 leaders in the African American community today.  And allow me to express my appreciation for their leadership and their efforts in communicating to African Americans and other minority populations some of the unique challenges that those communities face in the midst of this epidemic.
And the CDC, as the Surgeon General said, is working on not only studying the issue, but very rapidly issuing new guidance.  And we’ll be communicating that new guidance to all of those great leaders.
On the subject of testing and supplies, the President gave a great amount of detail.  More than 2.1 million tests have been performed and we continue to work very, very closely with FDA and suppliers around the country to expand the ability of testing.  And you just heard Dr. Hahn reflect on the fact that very soon we will have an antibody test that Americans will be able to take to determine whether they ever had the coronavirus.
I spoke today to the governor of Colorado, Jared Polis.  And we’ve been in contact with Senator Cory Gardner about an outbreak at a particular meatpacking facility in the Colorado area.  And at this time, our team is working with the governor and working with the senator to ensure that we flow testing resources.  At this point, there are some 14 people hospitalized, maybe 2- to 300 of the workforce have been impacted.  And we spoke about providing those resources this weekend.  I want to encourage people in Colorado that we will — we will work to support that effort, but I also want to emphasize that all the people that are working in food supply — from farmers, to meatpackers, to distributors, to truckers, to grocers — continue to have our gratitude, as President Trump said just a few moments ago.
On supplies: More than 5 billion have been obligated to the states, 29,600 National Guard have been activated, and, at the President’s direction, more than 4,700 active duty military personnel have been deployed — medical military personnel — in nine states, focusing on the areas of the most significant epidemic.
Air bridge, its 26 flights have been completed.  Four flights are scheduled to arrive today, bringing a quarter million gowns, 25 million pairs of gloves.  Fifty-four more flights are scheduled, literally bringing in supplies from around the world.
Finally, let me say, as we go into this very special weekend — into Easter services.  I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how grateful we are to all of the churches that have been there — and their ministries have been working under great difficulty — to continue to provide for the needs of your members.  There have been — there have been food drives, there have been phone calls, and ministry has continued.  And we are grateful for the role, on this Holy Week, that our churches, our synagogues, and all of our houses of worship have played.
On their behalf, allow me to remind you that even if you’re not in the pew this Easter Sunday, if you are able, it’s still a good idea to give, because those ministries continue to go forward.  And we encourage you — we encourage you to continue to support them.
We also want to say very respectfully to all of the — all the church communities around this country and all the places of worship to continue to heed the guidelines issued in the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America.  We know it’s difficult in this time of year, particularly, Mr. President, to avoid gatherings of more than 10.  But we’re grateful that so many churches, synagogues, and places of worship have done just that, and we urge you to continue to do it.
And to my Christian brothers and sisters across the country, let me encourage you with the words we should all remember that Jesus said, “Wherever two or more are gathered, there He is also.”  And so you can worship, you can celebrate Easter, and know that you’ll be blessed in so doing.  And you’ll be serving the nation.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job.  Thank you.
Okay, it’s Good Friday.  Let’s be nice.  Okay?  Let’s be real nice.  Yeah, please.  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-24/

6:24 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  I’d like to begin by saying that we just completed a meeting with the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao on proposals regarding the airlines and the airline business.
And we’re working very closely with a lot of different people.  We’ll be probably putting out a proposal and giving them some of the details — some of the very powerful details over the weekend.  It’s moving along quickly.  The airline business has been hit very hard, as everybody knows.  And we are going to be in a position to do a lot to help them so that they keep their employees and they save their businesses.
And that’ll be taking place, I think you can say, over the weekend.  We may even have discussions with some of the airlines or all of the airlines over the weekend.  And I think it’s going to be a very acceptable package.  It’s a very big package and a very acceptable package.  It’ll be good for our country, good for the airlines, good for a lot of people.
Likewise, I just spoke with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, and we had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than it’s doing right now.  It’s — the numbers are so low that there’ll be layoffs all over the world.  There’ll be certainly layoffs in this country.  And we don’t want that to happen.
We built a great, great energy business in the United States.  So we have tens of thousands of jobs.  We had a very good talk; we’ll see what happens.  But as you know, OPEC met today, and I would say they’re getting close to a deal.  We’ll soon find out.  So that was a conversation we just had, so we had a busy hour and a half.
And let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the American people.  Millions of Americans are making profound and difficult sacrifices in their own lives because they know it will save the lives of countless others.  And that’s exactly what it’s doing.  You see what’s happening and where we are and where we stand.  And hopefully we’re going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope.
Together, our people are writing one of the most noble chapters in the proud history of our nation.  Americans are also encouraged to learn that Boris Johnson, Prime Minister, has been moved out of intensive care.  That’s a tremendous statement.  And we continue to pray for him and his fast recovery.  That’s a very — a very positive development.
As the New York metropolitan area continues its battle against the outbreak, the full power of the federal government is there to support them.  As you know, the Javits Center has now been fully converted into a 3,000-bed hospital — one of the
largest anywhere in the country — and by the incredible professionals.
I have to say, the Corps of Engineers, what they can do is just incredible.  They’ve done a fantastic job and they’re building, nationwide, 21 temporary hospitals and care facilities, adding 17,000 hospital beds.  And they did that all within a very short period of time.  It’s incredible what they’ve done.  Army Corps of Engineers.  And FEMA has been fantastic.
Our sweeping airlift operation to keep doctors and nurses supplied with protective equipment, Project Airbridge, continues to expand with more than 24 flights already completed and 49 additional flights now scheduled in the near future.  So that’s been very successful.  And that gear and those outfits are being handed out.  As they arrive, they’re going directly to point.
The American medical system continues to perform beyond our highest expectations, reminding us that the United States is blessed with the most advanced healthcare and the most skilled healthcare workers anywhere in the planet.  Other countries are looking to what we’re doing.  And our testing operation has now become far and away the most sophisticated and the best anywhere.
And we want to thank all of the heroes on the frontlines as they fight to save American lives.  We’re at the top of the hill.  Pretty sure we’re at the top of the hill, and now we’re going downward.  In some cases, we’ve already started that process.
Earlier today, I spoke with hundreds of mental health leaders and advocates from around the country to discuss the vital work and the vital work they’re doing.  We had the top doctors in the country, some international doctors.  Mental health — big factor.  Not only has the virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people, but also mental and emotional suffering as well.  Even though we’re staying physically apart, no American is alone, and we’re all in this together.  But the mental health doctors and experts — it was a very great call.  It was a very interesting call.  They’re working very hard.
We’re also seeing encouraging signs in our race to develop breakthrough treatments and therapies.  Pfizer revealed today that it has found a promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating.  And that hopes — it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials very soon.  It’s going to be very, very soon.  They have great — great feelings for this particular therapy, and they think that a lot of good things are happening.
Through the FDA’s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, 19 therapies and treatments are now being tested and 26 more are in the active planning or [for] clinical trial.  So we have 19 therapies being tested currently, and 26 more are in the active planning for clinical trials.  That’s a big statement.  That’s a lot.
Trials for Gilead’s antiviral drug, remdesivir, continue.  And the company has also expanded emergency use for new patients getting good, early results, by the way.  The companies that manufacture hydroxychloroquine are massively ramping up production.
As you know, many people are recommending, strongly, Z-Pak be added — the Z-Pak — and also zinc.  And the federal government continues to build our stockpiles and distribute millions of doses for doctors to use as they see fit.
And I’m pleased to inform you — we’re just having — a lot of good things are happening, but we’ll have to see how that all works out.  But we have — we’ve purchased and we have stockpiled millions and millions of doses, and we’re distributing it.  Some states want it very badly.  Michigan — we just sent a lot to Michigan and other areas.
I’m reporting today that we passed 2 million tests completed in the United States, first time — most anywhere in the country.  It’s a milestone for our country.  It’s a milestone anywhere.  Nobody has done anywhere close.  Our tests are highly sophisticated and highly accurate.
At the same time, we’re making important progress on the economic front of this war.  In a few moments, Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, will explain new steps that we’re taking to ensure American workers swiftly receive unemployment and paid leave benefits and that employers protect the health and safety of all workers, including essential workers on the job, working very, very closely with workers and with employers.
To provide further economic relief, the Federal Reserve announced this morning that it’ll provide up to $2.3 trillion in support to businesses, states, and local governments.  Six hundred billion dollars in loans will be available for mid-sized businesses with up to 10,000 employees.  And $500 billion will be available for states, counties with over 2 million residents and cities with a population of over 1 million.
My administration is also working with Congress to replenish the very successful — incredibly successful the way it’s going — Paycheck Protection Program, which is allowing hundreds of thousands of small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll, meaning it’ll keep those businesses open.
We need both Democrats and Republicans to come together to get this leg- — the legislation completed.  And it looks like it’s on its way, but we need both.  And it should be for people that are working for the workers.  And if you look and you see, we have a lot of people that are affected by that, and it’s a very positive development.  So we have to get a bipartisan approval of that.  And hopefully that’ll happen.
Today, the Department of Education is also announcing the availability of more than $6 billion in emergency grant funding to assist college students impacted by the cancellation of classes and the suspension of housing.  A lot of people had a lot of things suspended; housing is one of them.
Previously, we waived student loan payments for six months.  So, student loan payments have been waived for six months, and we’ll discuss it after that.  It may go further.
Although this medical war has separated our citizens for a period of time, it’s also united our entire nation, I think I can say, like almost never before.  Americans are moving forward with common purpose and shared resolve, determined to vanquish the virus and lift our nation to even greater heights.  We are supremely confident in the magnificent future that awaits the American people.
And with that, before I invite our Vice President — our great Vice President — and Gene Scalia to speak, we’ll take a few questions.  And then I’m going back into negotiations on oil and on airlines.

5:47 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is a holy week, when religious believers across the nation will observe Passover, Good Friday, and Easter.  Millions of Jewish families begin Passover at sundown tonight, a sacred, unbroken tradition that traces back to the ancient land of Egypt.  And on Sunday, we celebrate our beautiful, wonderful Easter, which we all look forward to.  And we’re going to have many Easters together in churches in the future.
We’re getting closer.  You see the numbers.  We’re getting much closer to getting our country back to the way it was.  We have now an extra two countries that have been attacked: 184. They’re being attacked as we speak, but we’ll all win.  At some point, we’re going to all win.  We’re going to do it sooner than people think.
Earlier today, I spoke with 10,000 of America’s faith leaders to thank them for raising the spirits of our people during these very difficult days.  While we may be physically apart, we can use this time to pray, to reflect, and to focus on our personal relationship with God.
I also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration’s ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus.  And that’s happening.  And it’s happening, I think if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought.  Maybe a lot more quickly, I hope.  And it’s something that all over the world we’re watching, but people are watching us and seeing what we’re doing, and they’re very impressed.
We’re dealing with many countries right now.  Many, many countries.  And we’re giving them whatever information we’re able to glean.
I just spoke with the representatives of the UK, and I think that their great prime minister is doing much better today, or at least better.  But certainly he’s had a tough bout, and he’s still going through a tough time, but he seems to be doing better.  And that’s good.
And we — we send our regards to Boris and his family and his friends, all of the people that really love him.  He’s — he’s become a very popular — before this happened, became a very popular prime minister.  He’s doing an excellent job.  He loves their country; he loves our country.  So we appreciate everything he’s done, and hopefully he’s going to be okay.
Speaking of great people, and people that have done a fantastic job, I have Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with us. And I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words.  And then I think what we’ll do, in order to get him back to the State Department, we’ll take some questions and we’ll then go on with the rest of what I’m going to say.  And then we’ll take some questions after that, and then Vice President Pence will take over.
So, Mike Pompeo, please.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Mr. President. Under the President’s leadership, my team and I at the State Department are doing our part to protect the American people from the virus and, importantly, to get them home.
As you know, when many countries shut down their rail lines, their buses, their infrastructure systems, the capacity to get out of those countries — they were trapped, they’re stranded — the State Department swung into action.
Since January 29th, we have now repatriated over 50,000 United States citizens back to their homes from more than 90 countries, more than 490 flights back to the United States from all across the world.  This worldwide scale of our repatriation efforts is without parallel in our lifetime.  We are coordinating with foreign governments, militaries, airport authorities, medical units, transportation companies, hotels, you name it.  We’re working with them to make sure the American people get back to be with their families.
You can see, behind me, the map of the flights, that we have brought back people —
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  — from all across the world.  Every day, I get a chance to hear some of the remarkable stories from our team.  Let me give you just a couple of examples.
Our mission in Peru: Working with the Peruvian military and police forces to send riverboats up the — up the river to get citizens that were stranded deep inside the Amazon forest.
Our mission in Nepal: Make sure that a woman who was running low on medication could get what she needed at a pharmacy before boarding an evacuation flight that brought her back here.
In Honduras: After the government imposed a very strict 24/7 curfew and closed airports, our embassy sprang into action for stranded Americans — thousands of them.
A three-year-old boy told one of our consular officers just before he boarded the flight, “Thank you for helping me get back home to my dad.”  Pretty neat.
We’ve received similar messages from lots of people.  They’re proud to know that their country will not leave them stranded and we’re going to get them back home.
One woman wrote, quote, “I was in tears when I received the e-mail approving our flight back to the United States.  God bless the United States of America.”  And another said, “I felt like I had allies there that actually treated me like a person or a family member, not just a number.”
The Repatriation Task Force at State Department, our consular officers have done great work.  I want to thank our partners in the Department of Defense who have helped with some of these flights back home and other government agencies — our sisters and brothers across the United States government in this administration that have helped get these people back.
And then, lastly, aside from our repatriation efforts, we continue to help countries around the world as well.  We’ve got CDC officials helping these countries with expertise and all the things that these countries need to get their citizens safe and healthy and back so that we can get the economy all across the world — the global economy — back on its feet when this crisis is over.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thanks, Mike.  Maybe you stick for a little while —
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Sure.
THE PRESIDENT:  — and we’ll see if anybody has any questions for Secretary of State.
Anybody?  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-22/

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
5:43 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Today, we continue to send our love to the great people of New York and New Jersey.  We support them fully.  We grieve alongside every family who has lost a precious loved one.  New Yorkers are tough and strong and brave.  New Jerseyites are tough and strong and brave, and they’re being hit very hard right now.  And for the next week, hopefully not much longer than that, it’s going to start to go in the other direction.
Our country is being hit hard, but some areas have done so incredibly well.  We’re so proud of them.  They will beat this virus.  We’re going to beat it with the grit and the heart for which they’re known and for which our country is known.  And we appreciate everything that everybody is doing.
We also — we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  He’s become a great friend of ours.  He loves this country; he loves his country.  But he loves the USA.  And he’s always been very good to us.  Whenever we had difficulty, he was with us, and we appreciate it.  So, we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  He’s going through a lot.
As we intensify our military campaign against the virus, I think that it must be brought out that we have to thank the American people for continuing to follow our guidelines on “slowing the spread” — an expression that more and more people are thinking about.  Nobody ever heard of it two months ago, and now everybody is talking about “slowing the spread,” stopping the spread.
Even during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope.  And this will be a very painful week.  And next week, at least part of next week, but probably all of it — look, if one person dies, it’s a painful week.  And we know that’s going to, unfortunately, happen.  This is a monster we’re fighting.
But signs are that our strategy is totally working.  Every American has a role to play in winning this war.  And we’re going to be winning it.  We’re going to be winning it powerfully.  And we’ll be prepared for the next one, should it happen, but hopefully it won’t.
Our massive airlift operation for critical supplies — it’s called Project Airbridge — continued today as five massive planes, flights, landed in the United States packed with personal protective equipment.  And our nation’s heroic healthcare workers will be the beneficiaries of that.  Twenty-seven more flights are scheduled in the near future, over the next couple of weeks.
The Army Corps of Engineers is constructing facilities that will support more than 15,000 hospital beds to treat patients in need.  So they’re building now approximately 15,000.  They just completed the big one in New York.  They just completed and are in the process of continuing in Chicago and many other places.  They’re incredible.  The Army Corps of Engineers — we owe them a lot.  What they’re able to do in such a short period of time — they’ll build these massive facilities.  Two thousand beds in four days.  So it’s really something very special.  I know, I was in the construction industry, and you don’t see that happen very often.
I want to remind governors and emergency managers that sharing real-time data with us about equipment and their needs is very important.  All of their supplies, hospital occupancy is critical.  A lot of the occupancy is really getting a little bit lower than anticipated, and that’s good.  We, sort of, thought that was going to happen.
And we’re getting along very well with the governors.  This whole situation with respect to talking to us about equipment and equipment needs — giving us a little bit of lead time — so important.  All the supplies — we’re getting it to everybody like they never thought possible.  But we’ll ensure that we can rapidly deploy federal assets where and when they’re needed, especially on ventilators.
We’re actually getting some ventilators back.  As you know, the State of California was great.  They sent some back, which they won’t need.  And Washington State, likewise.  And we have some others coming back, so we’re using them in areas we need them.
We are pressing forward aggressively on the scientific frontier of the medical war.  The companies I’ve spoke to — the four leading — I call them the “genius companies” — they’re doing incredibly well with respect to cures and also with respect to a vaccine that’s going to protect us — totally protect us.  And they have some great potential.  It’s going to take a little while yet, but they have some great potential. Some great early results.
And the governors have been working hard, and we are working hard with the governors.  There’s been great coordination, especially over the last little while.  We’ve given them a lot of equipment, a lot of ventilators.  But a lot of equipment of all types.  And I will protect you if your governor fails.  If you have a governor that’s failing, we’re going to protect you.  But the governors are working well with us over the last period of time.
Today, in our stockpile of ventilators — and again, we need the stockpile so we can immediately move them from place to place, wherever the monster hits.  It’s a monster.  We have 8,675 ventilators right now, in stock, ready to move.
And we have all sorts of incredible soldiers.  Our military is going to move them, should they be needed in, as an example, if we need additional in New York or the New York City area.  You have state; you have city.  And I spoke to Mayor de Blasio, and we really have a great, well-coordinated campaign with Mayor de Blasio.  It’s been really good.  I spoke to Governor Cuomo.  There’s been great coordination.  So, if they need something, we have it.
If Louisiana needs something, we have it.  Same thing with Michigan.  Same thing with Illinois.  There are certain spots that are very hot.  And we’ll see what happens, but we’ll know — pretty much, we’ll have time, and we’ll be able to move it.
In addition to the 8,675 ventilators, we have 2,200 arriving on April 13th.  We have 5,500 arriving on May 4th.  These are ones that we’re building, for the most part.  And we have, as you know, great companies building them — Ford, General Motors, GE.  We have, really, some great companies that are doing it.  On May 18th, we have 12,000.  On June 1st, we have 20,000.  On June 29th, we have 60,000 ventilators coming.  Sixty — 6-0.  So we have a total of 110,000 ventilators coming over a short period of time.  I don’t think we’ll need them.  Hopefully, we won’t need them.  I don’t think we’ll need anywhere near them.  But we’ll have them for the future, and we’ll also be able to help other countries who are desperate for ventilators.
The UK called today and they wanted to know, would it be possible to get 200.  And we’re going to work it out.  We got to work it out.  They’ve been great partners, the United Kingdom. And we’re going to work it out for them.  So they wanted 200. They needed them desperately.
We now have 10 drugs in active trials, with 15 more soon to follow, as well as 2 vaccine candidates in active clinical trials.  We’ll do whatever it takes to secure needed medical supplies and bring more production of essential medicines back to our shores.  We’re doing that.  We’re bringing them back to our shores.  A lot of these companies — they went a little bit haywire.  They went away from this great country and they had them produced elsewhere.  So, we’re going to start bringing them back.  I’ve been talking about that for a long time, not only with medical, but lots of other things.
America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world.  And I think that’s probably why we have more cases.  Because when you look at some of these very large countries, they — I know they — I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do, but they don’t report them.
We’ve performed 1.87 million tests to date.  So that’s 1 million 870 thousand — million tests.  Think of that: 1,870,000 tests to date.  And now we’re performing them at a level that nobody has ever seen before.
As we announced yesterday, CVS testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island will be using Abbott Labs rapid five-minute test. We’re down to now five minutes.  It’s a five-minute test so that people can get their results back very quickly.
And we’re actively engaging on the problem of increased impacts — this is a real problem, and it’s showing up very strongly in our data — on the African American community.  And we’re doing everything in our power to address this challenge.  It’s a tremendous challenge.  It’s terrible.  And provide support to African American citizens of this country who are going through a lot.  But it’s been disproportional.  They’re getting hit very, very hard.
In fact, while we have Tony here, I’d like to maybe have you come up and address that one, and then I’ll continue.  But if you could address that, it would be great, Tony.  Please.
DR. FAUCI:  Yeah.  Thank you, Mr. President.  We have a particularly difficult problem of an exacerbation of a health disparity.  We’ve known, literally forever, that diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma are disproportionately afflicting the minority populations, particularly the African Americans.
Unfortunately, when you look at the predisposing conditions that lead to a bad outcome with coronavirus — the things that get people into ICUs that require intubation and often lead to death, they are just those very comorbidities that are, unfortunately, disproportionately prevalent in the African American population.  So we’re very concerned about that.  It’s very sad.  There’s nothing we can do about it right now, except to try and give them the best possible care to avoid those complications.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And, Tony, I think you’re going to have some pretty accurate numbers over the next few days, right?  But they are very — they’re very nasty numbers.  Terrible numbers.
In total, 1,200 Abbott machines — Abbott Laboratories, they’ve been fantastic — have been shipped now nationwide.  Up to 500 more are being produced every week, and 50,000 testing cartridges are being manufactured per day.  That means a lot of very fast tests.  No nation in the world has developed a more diverse and robust testing capacity than the United States.
We’re dealing with other nations, helping them out because the testing is very tough for them.  And our tests are very accurate.  A lot of tests are out there, and they’re not accurate at all.  In fact, some of the tests, you don’t have a clue what’s going on.  So we’re working with other nations trying to get them help, also.
At a time when many Americans are experiencing increased stress, anxiety, and personal loss, we must also ensure that our country can meet the mental health needs of those struggling in this crisis.  There are people struggling.  They’re struggling.  And some people are getting to know each other, frankly.  Some families are getting to know each other, on a positive note.  But there are a lot of people struggling.
On Thursday, I’ll be speaking to leaders and advocates from the mental health organizations all across our country.  And we are going to be talking about resources and tools that we’ll make available to them.  They need help.  And it’s a big problem.
When you take something where it was the most successful country in the world — still is — the whole world is shut down.  Think of it: We’re down to numbers that are incredible.
As I said yesterday, I think it’s 182 countries right now.  One hundred and eighty-two countries are under attack by the — by the scourge, by this virus.
But as we wage medical war on the virus, we’re also speeding economic relief to our people.  It’s incredible.  We just had a meeting that was absolutely incredible with the banks.  I spoke with leaders in the banking and finance industry about our efforts to help American workers and employers.
As of today, small business has proc- — has processed more than $70 billion in guaranteed loans and will provide much-needed relief for nearly a quarter of a million businesses already.
So we are going to be providing tremendous amounts of money to the small businesses of our country who have been absolutely clobbered.  And they’ll be keeping open and they’ll be paying their employees, and they’ll be all set to go.  We’re going to have a rocket upward.
I want to thank David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs; Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America; Gordon Smith, co-president, COO of JPMorgan Chase; Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo;  Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Al Kelly, CEO of Visa;  Michael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard; Noah Wilcox, CEO, chairman of Grand Rapids State Bank.  And we had numerous others also on the call.  And I just appreciate them.
They are — we’re way ahead of schedule, by the way.  We’re way ahead of schedule.  The Paycheck Protection Program has been incredible.
So based on the incredible success of the program, I’m announcing that I’ll be asking Congress to provide an additional $250 billion for the paycheck protection, which will help keep Americans employed to facilitate a quick and full recovery.
We’re doing very well.  We’re looking very bipartisan.  A lot of people want to do it.  And the — the plan is amazing.  You know, they’re processing hundreds of thousands of loans.  And this is the big banks that are doing it, the community banks.  But the biggest banks right now in our country are doing it, and they’re — they’re doing it for a lot of reasons.  One of them is they want to help people.
The WHO, that’s the World Health Organization, receives vast amounts of money from the United States.  And we pay for a majority — biggest portion of their money.  And they actually criticized and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.  And they were wrong.  They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.  And they had a lot of information early and they didn’t want to — they’re very — they seem to be very China-centric.  And we have to look into that.  So we’re going to look into it.
We pay for — we give a majority of the money that they get.  And it’s much more than that the 58.  Fifty-eight million dollars is a small portion of what they’ve gotten over the years.  Sometimes they get much more than that.  Sometimes it’s for programs that they’re doing, and — and it’s much bigger numbers.  And if the programs are good, that’s great, as far as we’re concerned.
But we want to look into it — World Health Organization — because they really are — they called it wrong.  They called it wrong.  They really — they missed the call.  They could have called it months earlier.  They would have known, and they should have known.  And they probably did know, so we’ll be looking into that very carefully.
And we’re going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO.  We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we’re going to see.  It’s a great thing if it works, but when they call every shot wrong, that’s no good.
We’re in the midst of a great national struggle, one that requires the shared sacrifice of all Americans.  In recent weeks, it’s been remarkable to see so many companies and organizations and individuals, like the banks that I just told you about — biggest banks in the world.  They stepped up to help small business.  They have big business, small business.  The small business will someday be the big business.  But the small business is 50 percent of our economic strength.  People don’t realize when you add them up, but they just — they just rose to the occasion.  Everybody is rising to the occasion.  It’s been incredible to watch.
To honor and celebrate the extraordinary examples of patriotism and citizenship, we’re seeing — I’m asking Americans to use the hashtag #AmericaWorksTogether when sharing stories of how we’re all working together, get through — getting through this ordeal in a fashion that nobody would have ever thought possible.  It’s been incredible.  And that’s why the numbers are, so far, much better.  We want to keep it that way.
If you look at the original projections: If we did nothing, it would be disastrous.  If we — we decided to do something.  We closed it down; had no choice.  It was a good move.  That was a good move.  The early China move was a good move.  The early Europe move was a good move.  Made a lot of good moves.  But closing it down was a big statement.  It was a big, important thing.
But we’re looking to have far fewer deaths than originally thought.  And I think we’re heading in that direction, but it’s too early to talk about it.  I don’t even want to talk about it now because we just want to work.
And I think that people are doing an incredible job.  The doctors, the nurses, the firefighters, the police — all medical people, what they’re doing — the bravery that they’re displaying is just incredible.
Every citizen should take immense pride in the selfless — selflessness and all of the courage and compassion of our people.  The workers — the people that are working and construction workers going into hospitals, knowing nothing about this problem, other than it’s dangerous.  And they go in there to rebuild sections of hospitals.  And you have people in really big trouble right next door.  They know nothing about it.  All they know is they’re going to get it done, they’re going to fix that wing so they can have more people in there.  It’s incredible.
But this is a national spirit that won our independence and settled the frontier and explored the horizons of space.  And that’s what we’re doing.  I mean, this is all — this is all new territory.
It unlocked the miracles of science and what — we’re doing that when you — I wish you could have heard the calls I had yesterday with these great companies that come up with cures to diseases.  And the success they’ve had over the last 15 years is really amazing.  So I just want to thank all of them.  They’re working very hard.
They’re working with UK, right now, and the UK doctors — hopefully helping with their great Prime Minister.  But these people are really a — tremendous signs of success are staring us right in the face.  I think we’re going to have something that’s going to be great, in terms of vaccines and in terms of everything else that they’re doing, just helping — really helping us, helping the people of our country and helping, ultimately, the people of the world.
So I want to thank you all for being here.  I will take some questions, and then I’m going to give it over to the Vice President and they’re going to go into great detail on to what we’re doing and all of the successful supplies and medical equipment that we’re getting — all of the ventilators.  I’ve said it, but you can go over it in more detail if you’d like.  But we’re taking in and building thousands and thousands of ventilators.  And they’re very high quality.  I said, “You got to go for the quality.”  And these are quality companies doing it.
So — because there is a big difference between a good ventilator and a not-so-good ventilator, Tony, right?  We’ve seen that.  And — big difference.  So we’re going top of the line.

April 6, 2020
5:41 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  This week, America continues our aggressive effort to defeat the virus as we enter a crucial and difficult phase of the battle.
We continue to send our prayers to the people of New York and New Jersey, and to our whole country.  But right now, New York and New Jersey are very hot zones, and we’re with them.  We’re with everybody.  Your struggle is our struggle, and we will beat this virus.  We will beat it together.
I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery.  He’s been a really good friend.  He’s been really something very special.  Strong.  Resolute.  Doesn’t quit.  Doesn’t give up.
We have made tremendous progress on therapeutics.  I had a fantastic call today, which I’ll be talking about a little bit later.  And I’ve asked two of the leading companies — these are brilliant companies.  Ebola, AIDS, others.  They’ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs.  And I’ve asked them to contact London immediately.  They have offices in London.  They’re major companies.  But more than major, more than size, they’re genius.
And I had a talk with four of them today.  And they speak a language that most people don’t even understand, but I understand something: that they’ve really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically, and they have arrived in London already.  Their London office has whatever they need, and we’ll see if we can be of help.
We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place.  But they are ready to go.  But when you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.
So, the two companies are there.  And with what they are talking about — and it’s rather complex and has had really incredible results — we’re working with the FDA and everybody else, but we are working with London, with respect to Boris Johnson.
Across the country, we’re attacking the enemy on all fronts, including medical, scientific, social, logistical, and economic.  We’re pressing into action the full power of American government and American enterprise.  And our military has been incredible.  We’ve just sent 3,000 public health personnel.  They’re now deployed in the New York area, and they’ll be over at the Javits Center, over at the great ship.
And as you probably have heard — and I was informed that Governor Cuomo has already told you and announced — he called me up a little while ago, and he asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship, with respect to fighting the virus.  And we hadn’t had that in mind at all, but we’re going to let him do it, and we’re also going to let New Jersey.  Governor Murphy — we spoke with him a little while ago, and New Jersey is going to use it also because New Jersey is a hot — a hotspot.
So Governor Murphy and Governor Cuomo are going to be using the ship for New York, New Jersey.  And it’s a big ship, and it’s now COVID; it’s set for COVID.  And we are going to — hopefully that will be very helpful to both states.  The Javits Center, which is 2,900 beds, just built by our military, also is going to be manned now by the military.  And they should be in place tomorrow, and they’ll start sending quite a few people over to the Javits Center.  It’s convenient.  It’s right in the middle of everything.  So that’ll be something great.
And we appreciated Governor Cuomo’s nice — really nice statements and, likewise, Governor Murphy.  We have worked very well with both of them and with, frankly, all of the governors.  Vice President Pence had a call this morning with them that lasted for close to two hours.  And I understand there wasn’t a negative person on the call.  Fifty governors — or just about fifty governors — I think they were all on, from what I understood.  And they were very positive about everything their federal government has been doing for them.  And you’ll hear what that is, and it’s — it’s rather amazing, actually.
Nationwide, the Army Corps of Engineers is building 22 field hospitals — these are big hospitals — and alternate care sites in 18 states.  So you have a combination of 22 field hospitals.  In addition to that, we’re building alternate care sites, which is a little bit of a smaller version of the hospital.  And we have a lot of them, and they’re going up in 18 different states.
In total, we have deployed 8,450 hospital beds from federal stockpiles.  And, you know, if you think, this is done over a period of — really, a period of weeks.  It’s incredible, actually.  More than 8,000 ventilators have been sent from the National Stockpile to our cities and states, backed by the Defense Production Act, which we’ve used very strongly, very powerfully.  So powerfully that we don’t have to use it too much, frankly.  And it’s nice when you don’t have to.  We’re getting more than we ever bargained for.
American industry is stepping up.  Manufacturers are really going to town.  And we have thousands of ventilators being built as we speak, and we have hundreds that are being sent to different locations, and we’re ready to roll with almost 10,000 that we have in the federal stockpile.
When I say “ready to roll,” too, I mean exactly what that states: We are — wherever that monster goes, we’re able to move with it.  Great flexibility.  We have tremendous flexibility.  And we have people waiting, and they’re ready, willing, and able, but waiting to bring them wherever it may be, if they need it.  If they need it.  It’s possible that they won’t be needed, that we’re fully stocked, because numbers are coming in where, because of what the American people are doing, we’re having fewer hospital visits.  I think that could be the case in New York.  It could be the case in a few other states.  And fewer beds, fewer hospital visits mean fewer ventilators.  So we’ll see whether or not our original projections were right.
But anyway, I had a very good talk with both governors, and I think they’re very happy — extremely happy about the — what we’re doing for them, and especially going all COVID.  So that’ll take place almost immediately.
FEMA and HHS have directly distributed 11.7 million N95 respirators.  Think of that.  Get the number.  11.7 million N95 respirators.  11.7 million.  26.5 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22.6 million gloves.  22.6 million gloves.
We have also arranged for vast quantities of additional materials to be allocated through donations and existing supply chains.  We’ve also given tremendous medical material and supplies throughout the 50 states and territories.
And through Project Airbridge, we have succeeded in bringing planeloads of vital supplies into the United States from overseas.  We had an additional three.  These are massive planes, by the way.  The big planes — they’re very big, very powerful, and they’re loaded to the gills with supplies.  And rather than bringing them into our stockpile, as we’ve discussed, we bring them to all the different locations where they’re needed so we can save a big step and a timely step.
Because of my actions, under the DPA, I can also announce today that we have reached an agreement — a very amicable agreement — with 3M for the delivery of an additional 55.5 million high-quality facemask — facemasks each month.  So that we’re going to be getting, over the next couple of months, 166.5 million masks for our frontline healthcare workers.
So the 3M saga ends very happily.  We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M and its CEO, Mike Roman.  I just spoke with him and I thanked him for getting it done.  And Mike was very happy to get it done.  It’s a great company.  So we’re getting 166.5 million masks, and mostly that’s going to be for our frontline healthcare workers.  Okay?  That’s 3M.  Thank you, 3M.
I also want to thank Apple, one of the many great American companies that’s taken into — that’s really leapt into action.  Today, Apple announced that it is now producing plastic face shields for healthcare workers at the rate of 1 million per week.  One million.  And these are the shields that you see on television quite a bit.  And they’re at the highest level of quality and safety.
We’re grateful, as well, to Salesforce, which has donated 48 million pieces of personal protective equipment, including masks, gowns, suits, and face shields.  So thank you very much to Salesforce.
I urge all of our nation’s governors to ensure that the massive deliveries that we’ve made to your states over the past few weeks are distributed as quickly as possible.
So again, we’re working very well with the governors.  Now, they may see you and say, “Oh, we’re not happy.”  But they’re very happy on the phone.  And Mike Pence is a straight shooter, and he had a great phone conversation to them, with all of the governors.  Teleconference.  And they’re very happy, every one of them.
Were there any negatives?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  No, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  See?  I told you.  Mike is the greatest.  Mike — and you have done a great job, Mike, and I appreciate it.  The whole country appreciates it.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.
Anthony appreciates it, right?  Aren’t you — see?  Everybody appreciates Mike.  A special man.
So a lot of the things that we’ve done, again, are going directly to the states.  The states seem to be very happy.  If they’re not, they can call me directly, they can call Mike directly, and we’ll make them happy.  But tremendous progress has been made in a very short period.
And I think, very importantly, the progress has been made before the surge comes, because the next week, week and a half, is going to be a big surge, the professionals tell us.  And I think we’re in good shape for it, Anthony.  So it’s good timing.  Really good timing.  We can have the stuff there.  It’s already there, for the most part, but we’re bringing a lot of different resources to the various locations, especially where the surge is looking like it’s going to take place.
Resources from the National Stockpile need to reach our warriors.  And they are warriors.  I tell it all the time.  I saw it again this morning, these young, in many cases — in many cases, older — but they’re walking into the hospital, and they’re putting on — I mean, as that door is opened, they’re going into this place, and, you know, it’s not exactly too safe.  And they’re going in there and they’re putting the outfits on and they’re putting their masks on, and they’re — it’s incredible.  It’s no — it’s truly — it’s like no different than you watch the war movies or you watch the old clips of war, running up hills.  It’s — to me, it’s the same thing.
Men and women, young and old, but a lot of young people, just going in there.  They’re not thinking about, “Oh, gee, this is dangerous.”  They’re not saying, “Oh, I don’t want to go in.”  They’re — they’re warriors.  They’re running through those doors.  It’s the most incredible thing.  It’s a beautiful — it’s an incredible, beautiful thing.
Resources from the National Stockpile need to reach these warriors in the hospitals immediately, and we’re making sure they do.  And again, the states have that responsibility, but we’re working with the states and we’re getting the states a lot of things that they can distribute.  Or when they tell us, we bring it directly to the hospital from the federal stockpile, or from the planes that land without even going to the stockpile.
If any state is having difficulty distributing supplies, we urge you to use the National Guard to assist in the delivery.  And I have to say, you have done a fantastic job.
Deborah, you know that you’ve done great.  Tony, you know that you’ve done great.
But what a job you’ve done.  And I appreciate it.  I really do.  Your whole group has been incredible.  That’s a lot of stars you have.  I’ll tell you that.  He’s supposed to do a great job when you have four stars, right?
But the military has been incredible, and I thank them for all of us.
Conversely, if a state believes that it has surplus equipment or supplies — very important, because we actually have gotten so much to some of the states that they’re able to now — they’ve done a fantastic job and they’ve kept — they’ve kept that line low.  And we have some states that have surplus equipment and supplies, and they’re working with us to rapidly redeploy those supplies to areas of greatest need.  We thought that might happen.  If it worked out well, that’s what was going to happen, and it’s happening.
And I want to thank Governor Gavin Newsom, who’s doing a tremendous job, who’s announced California will send 500 ventilators to be distributed to other locations.  I think some are going to Arizona.  Some are going to Washington, D.C.  We think they’re going to Delaware.  We’re working it out.  But 500 excess ventilators from the State of California.  And we’re going to get them taken care of wherever they have to go.  Those decisions are being made right now.
The members of the White House Task Force and I are in close touch with mayors and governors and hospital administrators across our country.  And we’re told that the present time — at the present time, most of the critical needs are — are being more than met.  States have to continue sharing detailed information in the amount and utilization rates of medical supplies so we know what to resupply them.  Or they can get it directly; that includes ventilators.  They can get it directly.  Ideally, if they can get it directly, but if they can’t, if they’re unable to do it, we have tremendous amounts of supplies.  And we’re building it up very fast too.  And this is before the big surge.
This information is fundamental to our ability to deliver the material when — when and where it’s most needed.
Now, Mike, in his conversation today, I think got some information as to a couple of locations where we’re going to be delivering large numbers of ventilators and large numbers of medical supplies.  And we’ll take care of that.
But some of the states are very happy.  Even Governor Pritzker, from Illinois, is happy.  Of course, he may not be happy when he talks to the press, but he’s happy.  He’s a very happy man.
We’re increasingly hopeful that the aggressive mitigation strategy we put into place will ultimately allow our hospital system to successfully manage the major influx of cases that — that we have right now.  Again, I say that we’re finding, because of the incredible job done by the American people in conjunction with everybody — governors, the military, federal government, state government, local government — had a lot of conversations with New York City and Mayor de Blasio.  I’ve gotten to know him.  I didn’t know him.  Gotten to know him.  And a lot of people are working hard.  Everybody is working hard.  A lot of people are doing a great job — I’ll tell you that.  A lot of people are doing a great job.
But the goals that all Americans have been sacrificing to achieve these last few weeks are things that a lot of people thought were not possible to achieve.  And I think we’ve more than achieved, but we have to go through.
Again, we’re going to have a rough week.  We’re going to have maybe a rough a little more than a week.  And — but there’s tremendous light at the end of that tunnel.  I said it last time.  I said it last night: There’s tremendous light at the end of the tunnel.  There’s so many things happening with therapeutics, with vaccines, with things that we really want.
Deborah, Tony, they’re all working so hard on this.  But those therapeutics — I mean, look, the vaccines are going to be always a little bit later because of that testing period, but the therapeutics — getting the kind of things that I heard about today, talking to these brilliant companies and brilliant people on the phone was fantastic.  It was such an incredible conversation.
And I also spoke, just a few minutes ago, with Vice President — former Vice President Biden, who called.  And we had a really wonderful, warm conversation.  It was a very nice conversation.  We talked about pretty much this.  This is what we talked about.  This is what everyone is talking about.  This is what they want to talk about.  And he gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that.  And we just had a very friendly conversation.  It lasted probably 15 minutes, and it was really good.  It was really good.  Really nice.  I think it was very much so.  I appreciate his calling.
As we continue our efforts to develop treatments and cures, this afternoon I spoke with leaders of the American pharmaceutical companies.  And just to give you their names: Amgen, Genentech, Gilead, Regeneron.  These are four the greatest in the world for doing exactly what they’re doing.
And currently, 10 different therapeutic agents are in active trials and some are looking incredibly successful, but we have to go through a process.  And it’s going to be a fairly quick process, I will tell you, based on what the FDA told me.  And another 15 are in plans for clinical trials.  So they’re advancing rapidly.
And today, a second company announced that the FDA has authorized its vaccine candidate to begin clinical trials.  So you have — Johnson & Johnson is already there.  I believe they’re the one that’s first.  And now we have a second company that just — just announced.  And we were just — it was just approved.  So we have two companies at that level for the vaccine itself.
We’ve now performed 100 — well, if you think of this: 1.79 million tests.  That’s 1,790,000 tests nationwide.  And I think we’re going to put up a screen here someplace.  Good.  They’re on cue.  They’re just on cue.  And here it is.  This is the process starting on 5 March and ending right there.  Right about now.  Right?  That’s about it.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Yesterday.
THE PRESIDENT:  So — and it’s going up at a rapid rate.  Nobody has done more testing.
And one of the reasons why they say — and I think I can say this, Deborah, very strongly — but one of the reasons that we have more cases is we’ve done more testing.  If I went to some of these countries that have, in my opinion, far more people than we do, that had the problem, and if we did the kind of testing proportionately that we’re doing, they’d have many more cases than us.  But we have more cases because we do much more testing.
So when you do the testing, you have cases.  Otherwise, you wouldn’t know about the cases.  People sit home; you don’t know about it.
But we have now done 1,790,000 tests nationwide.  That’s more than any other country in the world, hence we have more cases.  And that number is growing by nearly 125,000 people per day.  Think of that one.  So it’s growing by 125,000 people per day.
I told you about South Korea.  This is a, you know, vastly faster — and we also have, they say, the most accurate of tests.
CVS is launching — and they’ve been great — two new drive-through testing sites in Atlanta, Georgia, and Providence, Rhode Island.  And each location will be able to test up to 1,000 patients per day using the ultra-fast five-minute test developed by Abbott Labs.  Now they’re down to five minutes.  They call it the “ultra-fast” and it’s very accurate.  Abbott Labs, I want to thank them.  They’ve been fantastic.
We’re also speeding urgent economic relief to the American worker and families and the employers.  As of today, tens of thousands of small businesses have applied for more than $40 billion in relief under the Paycheck Protection Program.  You’ve all been reading about it.  And it’s really — I mean, it’s only been going for a couple of days.  It’s really been performing well.  A couple of little glitches — minor glitches that have already been taken care of, what they say.
These funds will result in nearly 2 million jobs being preserved.  So we’re taking care of our workers — small businesses and our workers.
Nearly 3,000 lenders have already made loans under the program, and we’re signing up additional lenders very quickly — rapidly.
Community banks have been very responsive, and larger banks are also stepping up.  If this — if we run out of funds — by the way, we’re already preparing because it’s going so fast for the small businesses and their employees — we’ll ask Congress to refill it immediately.  But the banks have been great.  The big banks — the Bank of America was right up there at the beginning.  JPMorgan Chase was — has been great.  After the first day, they really — they really came through, and a lot of the big banks.  But the community banks have been fantastic.
As we announced last week, we are providing $100 billion in direct support for our hospitals.  And the first tranche, $30 billion, will be distributed this week.
So I want to — I want to say one other thing.  Our farmers — we love our farmers — and, as you know, as of April 1st, the China trade deal — 250-billion-dollar — they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more.  And of that, approximately $50 billion is expected to be with our farmers.
So it kicked in as of April 1st, and we’ll see how it goes.  It seems like they’re buying.  So we’ll let you know how that’s going.  But they’re buying anywhere from $40- to $50 billion worth of our agricultural product.  That should have a huge impact on our farmers — a tremendous impact on our farmers.  But we’re watching it very closely.
To fight the medical war, we’ve mobilized the unbeatable — and it just — it is unbeatable — strength of American determination, ingenuity, and compassion.  I got to see that when I spoke to the great science — because I call them “science companies” more than drug companies.  They’re scientists.
We’ve seen businesses, charities, and private citizens making generous donations.  So many people are making donations.  We’ve seen states and cities supporting and helping each other and caring for our citizens.  And we’ve seen Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs uniting together to answer the challenge and rise to the moment.  And that’s what they’re doing.
Above all, we have been awe-inspired by the exceptional courage of the doctors, nurses, EMTs, and healthcare workers who are the soldiers of this war.  No words can ever express the complete measure of our gratitude for these intrepid heroes.
One Cleveland patient credited his medical team for not only saving his life through their skill, but forever changing his life through their example of selfless devotion.  Couldn’t believe it — so generous he was with his statements.  And he talked about their bravery in an area that was in such trouble — an area of that hospital where people were dying.  And he talked about their bravery.
Another survivor in Houston said simply, “I will consider them my angels forever.”  “I will consider them” — think of that — “my angels forever.”
As our nation endures the depths of loss and grief, we are also witness to the summit of American virtue, character, and courage.  With the love and dedication of every American patriot, we will win this battle, we will defeat this enemy, and we will rise from this present crisis with new strength, unity, and resolve.  And that’s what’s happening.
Tremendous stories are coming out of this horrible moment. A very dark moment for the world.  One hundred and eighty two.  I was saying 151 for a while, and then it got up to 160.  And it’s 182, as I announced yesterday.  A hundred and eighty-two countries are being attacked by this virus.
So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to thank the American citizens for doing a great job.  Stay inside.  And let’s win this, and let’s get our country open as soon as we can.  I think it’s going to be sooner than people think.  Things are going really well.  Again, light at the end of the tunnel.
And with that, I’ll take a few questions.  And then Mike is going to take over and talk with the Admiral and with the professionals.  And we appreciate you being here.
Yes, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-21/

April 5, 2020
6:59 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  All these people have been working very, very hard today, I’ll tell you.  For a long time, they’ve been working.
But before I begin, I want to express our nation’s well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus.  All Americans are praying for him.  He’s a friend of mine.  He’s a great gentleman and a great leader.  And he’s — as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I’m hopeful and sure that he’s going to be fine.  He’s a strong man, a strong person.
Today, every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey.  They’ve really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening.  In New York, the first time where the deaths were less from the previous day.  That’s the first drop so far.  So maybe that’s a good sign; it could be.  And the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease.  It’s been very short, but perhaps decrease.
So we wish Governor Cuomo and all of the people in New York great.  And, New Jersey, your governor is doing a great job.  He’s doing a great job in New Jersey.  They got hit very hard.
I just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprise — it really is.  This is an all-out military operation that we’ve waged, and especially over the last number of weeks.  Fifty states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual.
Thanks to the Army Corps of Engineers, New York City’s Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States.  It’s designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two Army hospital units, and they’re doing a great job.  This was something that we didn’t expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops — not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders.  People are now running Javits.
Also, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York — there’s been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all.  That was not supposed to be for the virus at all, under any circumstances. But it looks like, more and more, we’re going to be using it for that.  So we’ll see.  That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it’s very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road, no — no anything on the road.  Things that would normally be taken care of, we don’t see anymore.  So we haven’t seen that in a long time.  It’s, perhaps, a positive.
But the ship is ready.  And if it has to, if we need it — if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that.  They’d prefer not, for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it’s ready, willing, and able.
We have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world.  And we’re orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done.  We’ve never done anything like this.  And, more and more, we’re using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdictions, states — in particular New York, New Jersey, the Connecticut area.  Long Island now has become a hotspot — part of New York.  We’re sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we’re sending personnel where it’s needed.  Military personnel.
As of Tuesday, we’ll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country — 3,000 — and that number is going up.  And we hope we’re seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all.  So we’ll see.  You’ll be seeing that over the next few days.  Let’s see what happens.  But we’re prepared.
In the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of Earth.  They’re coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States, where the equipment isn’t as necessary.
Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost — listen to this — 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns.  And many more fully loaded cargo planes are right now on the way.  Three big ones landed today.  And these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that that massive amount of material that we’re getting in is being delivered all over the country.
Tomorrow, we’ll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system.  It was requested — Mayor de Blasio.  We’ve been working great with Mayor de Blasio, getting him a lot of stuff.  He’s working very hard; I can tell you that.  And we’re working, really, very hard with New York City and with New York State.
And at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin, out in Long Island, we will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County, where they need it very badly.  So we’re getting that out on an emergency basis.  It should be there tomorrow.
We’ll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Polowczyk will detail shortly.  The Admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes.
Over the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey.  Five hundred.  And again, the governor has been very thankful.  We’re working very hard with New Jersey, including building hospitals.
We’ve also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana — a definite hotspot.  Three hundred to Michigan — working very well, I think, with the governor.
Amazingly, 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois.  And, I mean, there’s a governor — I hear him complaining all the time — Pritzker.  I hear him; he’s always complaining.  And yet, I just said, “Give me a list of a couple of the things we’ve done in Illinois.”  And we’re building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place; that’s the big convention center in Chicago.  And we’re helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he’s not able to do what you’re supposed to be able to do as a governor.  He has not performed well.
And we’re also sending 100 ventilators to Massachusetts.
So we have 600 to Illinois.  We have 100 to Massachusetts.  We have 300 to Michigan.  We have 200 to Louisiana.  We have 500 ventilators — 500 — going to New Jersey.  And this is being done by FEMA.  It’s being delivered by FEMA.  And it’s — that’s some job.  Just think of that.  When you think about 500 ventilators, a ventilator is a big deal.
We’re also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington, D.C., area to help Washington, D.C., and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C.
At the same time, Governor Inslee — we appreciate this — of Washington State has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country.  So the State of Washington has done very well.  They won’t be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent — about 400.  That’s a lot.  And we appreciate that he’s able to give them back.  He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks, until we can declare a final victory.
In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic.  Our warriors in this life-and-death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight.  We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support.  They make all of us very proud.  Our country is very proud.  We have people — they love our country.  The world loves our country, most of it.  Probably all of it; they just don’t say it.
I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results — gotten results of 1.67 million people.  That’s far more than any other country has been able to do.  And you remember, we inherited a broken system.  So a lot of this has been developed.
By Tuesday, 1,200 brand-new rapid point-of-care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories.  A great company.  And they’ll be distributed to all of our public health labs — that’s a 15-minute test; even less — as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and the Strategic National Stockpile.
So we’re going to have 1,200.  And on a weekly basis, we’re making a lot more.  They go very fast.  They’re very accurate tests.  And other countries are wanting them.  So, at the right time, we’ll be able to do that.  But right now, we’re getting them to all of ours.
So we’ve done 1,670,000 tests.  Think of that: 1,670,000 tests.  And we have a great system now.  We’re working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system.
And the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxychloroquine — hydroxychloroquine — which I think — as you know, it’s a great malaria drug.  It’s worked unbelievably.  It’s this powerful drug on malaria.  And there are signs that it works on this.  Some very strong signs.  And, in the meantime, it’s been around a long time.  It also works very powerfully on lupus.  Lupus.
So there are some very strong, powerful signs, and we’ll have to see.  Because again, it’s being tested now.  This is a new thing that just happened to us — the “invisible enemy,” we call it.
And, if you can, if you have a — no signs of heart problems, the azrithromycin [sic] — azithromycin — which will kill certain things that you don’t want living within your body — it’s powerful drug — if you don’t have a problem, a heart problem, we would say: Let your doctor think about it.  But as a combination, I think they’re going to be — I think they’re two things that should be looked at very strongly.
Now, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxychloroquine — 29 million.  A lot of drugstores have them by prescription, and also — and they’re not expensive.  Also, we’re sending them to various labs, our military.  We’re sending them to the hospitals.  We’re sending them all over.
I just think it’s something — you know the expression, I’ve used it for certain reasons: “What do you have to lose?”  What do you have to lose?  And a lot of people are saying that when — and are taking it — if you’re a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good.  But what do you have to lose?  They say, “Take it.”
I’m not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this.  If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early.  But we have some very good signs.  So that’s hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
And, again, you have to go through your medical people, get the approval.  But I’ve seen things that I sort of like.  So what do I know?  I’m not a doctor.  I’m not a doctor.  But I have common sense.  The FDA feels good about it.  They’ve — as you know, they’ve approved it.  They gave it a rapid approval.  And the reason: because it’s been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential.  So, based on that, we have sent it throughout the country and we have it stockpiled — about 29 million doses.  Twenty-nine million doses.  We have a lot of it.  We hope it works.
Driven by the goal of the brightest minds in science — we have the brightest minds in science, but we’re driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus.  These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines.  We are working very, very hard.  I have met many of the doctors that are doing it.  These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus.
They’re staying — we strongly recommend staying at home, practicing vigorous hygiene, and maintaining social distance, so you’re — you’re just not going to catch it.  It’s the most effective weapon in this war.
And I will tell you, the — we are committing to the — to you.  We’re committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before.  They are — they are working so hard.  I see them.  I see them before my eyes, exhausted — people that I’m dealing with every day, exhausted.  They haven’t left their offices.  They haven’t left their hospitals.  We meet with them.  We see them.
And tremendous strides have been made.  I think the vaccines — we’ll have a report on that.  But the vaccines — we’re working together with other countries.  We’re also working with other countries — many other countries.  And we all want everyone else to be first.  We’re very happy.  But we are very far down the line on vaccines.  We’ll see how that all works.  Johnson & Johnson is doing a great job, working very hard.  A vaccine would be great.  Therapy — a therapy and therapeutics would be great.  We’ll see what happens.  In the meantime, you may listen to what I said about the two drugs mentioned.
My administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history.  You’ve seen what’s been happening.  Billions of dollars in small- business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Programs.
So we went out on Friday and, literally, it’s become so popular.  It’s been worked with the banks.  They get it to the small business.  It’s all about employment.  It’s all about jobs.  We want you to keep your jobs.  It gives small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll.  And we’re sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest-hit industries.  We’re saving industries.  We will be — you’ll be seeing it.  And if we do more, we’re going to do more, and we’re going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard.
But we’re going to take care of our workers.  We’re going to take care of our citizens.  We’re going to take care of our small businesses.  We’re going to take care of our large businesses: the airplane industry, the — the airline industry.  A lot of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time.
These are industries that were doing better — for the most part, doing better than ever.  The airlines were doing great.  Oil was doing great — oil and gas.  And the energy industry was doing phenomenally well, and it got hit like nobody has ever been hit before.  Just about like no industry has ever been hit before.  There’s never been anything like this.
But we see light at the end of the tunnel.  Things are happening.  Things are happening.  We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel.  And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we’ll be very proud of the job we all did.  We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we’re going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum — the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus.
In closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world.  While we may be apart from one another, as you can see from our great churches, our great pastors and ministers are out there working very hard.  But we may be apart — we can use this time to turn to reflection and prayer and our own personal relationship with God.
I would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle.  I had mentioned yesterday, where I see the nurses rushing into hospitals, and they’re putting on their outfits, and they’re putting on their masks and goggles, in some cases.  They’re rushing into war.  They’re rushing into war.
And I see people from apartment houses screaming and shouting and singing their praises.  It’s an incredible thing.  They’re warriors — these doctors and nurses.  They’re running into buildings, and they’re literally putting it on as the doors are opening.  They’re putting all their stuff and running inside.  And they’re running inside to tremendous danger.  Tremendous danger.
But, most of all, I’d like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones.  Ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief.  It’s a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world.
This morning — I was talking 151.  For four days, I said 151.  A hundred and fifty-one countries.  This morning, it’s 182 countries.  It jumped up a lot.  So, as of this morning, it’s 182 countries are under attack from this monster.
With the faith of our families and the spirit of our people, and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail.  We have learned so much.  We will be stronger than ever.
And I just want to thank everybody.  I want to thank the incredible professionals on the task force also.  We had a big meeting today.  We — were calls all day long to so many different people.  And I think our package to get everyone working when we’re ready is really turning out to be successful.  We may have to make it larger because it’s been really successful.  But all of that comes back to this country.  We want to get them back.  We want to get our people back to work.  Everybody wants to be back.  We want to open up our country as soon as possible.
So, with that, I’m going to ask Dr. Birx to say a few words, and she’s got some charts to show you.  And thank you very much.  Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  As you can see from the hopeful signs in Italy and Spain, where we see, finally, new cases and deaths declining, it’s giving us hope of what our future could be.
We wanted to give you an update on where all of the states were.  We’re looking at this as states normalized per 100,000 citizens.  It looks very similar to last week.  We wanted to update you.  We’ve been covering throughout the week the states that were moving on this map.
You can see very clearly where New York is as a state, although this is very much still centered in the New York metro area.  New Jersey is the orange line.  The green line is Louisiana.  That’s followed by Massachusetts, and then Connecticut and Michigan are together in those lines towards the bottom.  And then, of course, Washington, D.C., is now visible on this map, which was not visible before.  And the yellow line towards the bottom is Washington State.
Next slide, please.
So this just summarize all of the states we’re tracking very closely at the county level.  So we’re tracing and tracking not only the epidemic at the state level, but understanding what’s happening in county by county with new cases and, of course, also the deaths.
We’re also triangulating that with all of the laboratory data.  And just to tell you how we’re kind of doing that: For New York, which you can see at the top, their serology is now about 36 percent positive.  They were in the 40s.  So, day over day, their percent positive is finally starting to decline.  New Jersey’s is increasing, however.  They’re now up to 42 percent of the specimens that come to the laboratory are positive.  Louisiana, 25 percent.  Massachusetts, 20 percent.  Connecticut and Michigan, 20 percent.  District of Columbia, 15 percent.  Washington, 8 percent.  And then, Illinois and Colorado are at about 16 percent.  Pennsylvania, which is also new to the graphic, is it about 12 percent.
Next slide, please.
So, if we could go back one — I’m sorry.  If you go back one slide.  One more.  All of the states here, those are 38 of the states.  Thirty-eight of our states have less than 50 cases per hundred thousand.  They are testing.  Their laboratory results are consistent with that.  Their seropositivity rate for their laboratories are less than 5 percent.
So this is how we’re tracking and triangulating both case reporting, mortality or fatalities, and also triangulating that with the laboratory.
The New York metro area, New Jersey, Louisiana, and a series — and Washington State — have all tested at a rate greater than Italy and Spain.  I know many of you are tracking that. Remember, many of us, we pushed out a lot of those assays at the beginning, over the last two to three weeks.  And I want to just thank Admiral Giroir and HHS, who’s been working very closely to make sure that the states that were having an outbreak had access to all of their assays.
Next slide, please.  And then next one.
So just to give you an idea of how we’re looking at this, we look at cases every day.  I want to just thank my data team.  They spend all evening compiling data.  I get it about 2 o’clock in the morning.  And it looks at all of these metro areas by their granular counties.  So we can see the counties that have new cases.  That also helps us identify the hospitals and understand what hospitals will need ventilators or PPE.
So, this is the Detroit area; it’s Oakland and Detroit. Wayne County.
Next slide.
We also then — also track mortality.  It gives us insight into how many clients are in the ICU and need care.  And we want to make sure that we’re meeting the needs both on cases and really appreciating the frontline healthcare workers that are really saving many people’s lives.
Next slide.
This just gives you an idea from New Orleans.  We are now also tracking St. John the Baptist Parish also.  But this was the New Orleans and Jefferson County, and really tracking those on a case-by-case basis to look for changes over time.  And next slide is their mortality.  And you can see it’s starting to stabilize.
So this is how we’ve been tracking and tracing the epidemic as it moves through states and counties and communities.  But as we started, we just wanted to note again: We do see hopeful signs in Spain and Italy.  They have completed nearly four weeks of mitigation with people really doing social distancing, staying at home, ensuring they were washing their hands.  If they have to go out to the grocery store, they’re extraordinarily careful; they send one person from the family.
And so we can really see that beginning to work, and we’re very hopeful that, over the next week — although we’ll see rising number of cases of people who lose their lives to this illness — we’re also hopeful to see a stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago.
So thank you for your attention.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Admiral?  Please.
REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you, sir.  What I thought I would do is update on the average first, and then follow up on Dr. Birx and how we’re geographically aligning the supply chain.
So the average: We had three additional flights come in today, bringing a million gowns, 2.8 million N95 masks, 2.8 million surgical masks, 11.8 million gloves, 18.6 thousand gowns on three flights.  And that material will be pushed out across the nation, delivered to hospitals, nursing homes across the country.
Dr. Birx went through the geography.  And so, over the last few days, I’ve been aligning the supply chain to those areas, and then reaching down into those areas and extracting data from those areas on PPE burn rates.
So, for example, I spent the weekend talking to the chief operating officer of Detroit, Hakim Berry, for example, and talked to the leadership at Detroit Medical Center, Audrey Gregory; talked to the health officer at Oakland County, Michigan; and then also with the Chicago health officer, Dr. Allison Arwady.  So, reaching down to the — to a level to understand their needs.
So we’re geographically aligning the supply chain.  Right?  So you can see Dr. Birx went through these counties, and we’re getting down to the county level.  And then aligning it by priorities of point of care: public hospitals, first, VA hospitals, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care.
Over the coming days, we will be making a push to the geographic areas that Dr. Birx mentioned — increasing the volume through the supply chain to those areas to give them weeks, not just days’ worth of supply — primarily using our industry partners that we are directing: Cardinal, McKesson, Medline, Owen & Minor, Henry Schein, Concordance Healthcare — directing them to put product to the hospital door, the nursing home door, the first responders, directly to them.
We’re also working to push out millions of doses of hydrochlor- —
THE PRESIDENT:  Hydroxy.
REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Hydroxychlorine [sic].  Right.
We are working the distribution there to push the same thing to the same impacted areas, working to get it into hospitals and to every pharmacy.
And so my team is back there right now working the arrangements to make — make that to the hospital front door and primarily to the local pharmacies so a doctor can write those prescriptions and you can get it prior to having to go to a hospital.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you very much, Admiral.  Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Robert Wilkie, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, good.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I know you didn’t see him.
THE PRESIDENT:  Good.
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.  My last appearance here, I mentioned that the President had given the Department of Veterans Affairs very specific instructions to be as aggressive as possible in response to the virus crisis, not only to protect veterans but also to help the American people.
As many of you know, we have three primary missions at VA: One is to support veterans health.  The other is to provide veterans with benefits.  And the third is memorial services.  But we have a fourth mission, and that is to support the nation in times of national emergency, both in war and in peace.
We provide a bridge from the federal government to the states and localities during these emergencies.  As a result of that, I have ordered our veterans hospitals to begin preparing more than 1,500 beds to make them available both at the ICU and the acute-care level to the states and localities across the country.  As a result of that, we have opened up approximately 100 beds in the metropolitan New York area, in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan, and East Orange, New Jersey.
We will be informing the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, tomorrow, that we will give him access to our VA Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, to come to the aid of the people of the Pelican State.
I’ve also given instructions to initiate the fourth mission in Michigan.  We will be providing the people of Michigan access to hospital beds in both Ann Arbor and in Detroit.  We’ve also provided a pharmaceutical trailer to be used by the governor of Michigan, at Cobo Hall, to support the citizens of Michigan who will be coming into that facility for medical care.
We have also informed the state — the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that we will be helping them in their efforts to protect their most vulnerable citizens in two of their nursing homes.
So, in accord with the President’s instructions, the 400,000 men and women of the Department of Veterans Affairs are in this fight.  We are in the fight not only for the nine and a half million veterans who are part of our service, but we are in the fight for the people of the United States.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Robert.
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Mike?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And you all have just heard from several members of the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are — we are truly blessed to have the kind of leadership that we have.
And whether it be Admiral Polowczyk, who is organizing the distribution of tens of millions of supplies; whether it be Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, who are analyzing the data literally hour by hour; or whether it be that whole-of-government approach that you stood up, Mr. President, calling on every agency of government, including the VA, HHS, and every agency — I hope the American people know, at this President’s direction, we are — we are sparing no expense.  We are doing whatever it takes.  We’re marshaling the full resources of the federal government to respond to the challenges facing communities impacted today by the coronavirus and making sure every community in America has the support.
We’ve also — as the President has said so many times, we forged a seamless partnership with states around the country.  As the President just reflected, by this Tuesday, with another 840 military medical personnel arriving in New York City, there will be some 3,000 Department of Defense and HHS personnel on the ground to supplement and to provide relief to healthcare workers, really, at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the New York City area.  And you just heard the VA is opening up — opening up bed space.
In New Jersey, I spoke, at the President’s urging today, with Governor Murphy.  Five hundred ventilators, announced today, being built on the supplies that we have already provided.  We were able to coordinate with him to extent all federal coordination on testing in New Jersey through May the 30th, if the need is there, and also opening up VA beds.
I spoke with Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana and was encouraged to hear from him that, as you heard Dr. Birx say, that new cases were down slightly.  In fact, we’re seeing a trend of some leveling among all the governors I spoke to today.  And I know what the Secretary of the VA just announced — about opening up VA facilities — has been a priority for Governor Edwards, but I assured him we’re going to continue to send resources and supplies and personnel to support their healthcare.
In Michigan today, I spoke to both the governor, Gretchen Whitmer; and Mayor Mike Duggan of the city of Detroit.  Governor Whitmer and I spoke about a new program in Detroit that will make hydrochloroquine available for 3,000 patients through the Henry Ford Hospital.  They’ll be tracking, in a formal study, the results of that.
But at the President’s urging, I assured her that we’re more than prepared to make hydrochloroquine broadly available to pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the Detroit area as they deem appropriate.
I also heard from Mayor Mike Duggan, as I told you, Mr. President.  And he was so grateful to the FDA, not only for approving the Henry Ford Hospital tests that will be exploring hydrochloroquine, but also for the rapid approval of the 15- minute test.  In fact, Mayor Duggan told me that he was able to use the 15-minute test this weekend to test 150 first responders who had been sidelined because they’d been exposed to the coronavirus.  They all got the 15-minute tests.  They’re all back in the line of duty.  And the mayor couldn’t have been more grateful.
In Illinois, I spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker, as well as Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago.  As you just heard, not only have we sent 600 ventilators to the State of Illinois, but I assured — I assured the governor, I assured the mayor that while the principal focus that we have in the next several days is on the rising cases in the Greater New York City area and Louisiana, that Michigan and Illinois are in the forefront of our thinking.  And at the President’s direction, we’re going to make sure the people of Illinois and the people of Michigan have the resources, equipment, and support that they need.
The governor did express great appreciation for the fact that our Army Corps of Engineers had constructed 500 beds at McCormick Place, and before the end of this week would construct another 2,500 beds for an overflow healthcare facility in Chicago.
In fact, Mr. President, Mayor Lightfoot told me that the Army Corps was just outstanding in the job that they have been doing in constructing that extra bed space.
As I close, let me just — let me just express, as the President did, our profound appreciation for Governor Kate Brown and Governor Jay Inslee.  The State of Oregon and the State of Washington are leading by example.  Oregon sent 140 ventilators to New York City.  They looked at their circumstances and concluded that they could spare those at the point of the need. And because of the low and steady numbers in Washington State and in California, Governor Inslee today announced that they were sending 400 ventilators back to the Strategic National Stockpile.  And those will be deployed at the point of the need.
You know, not only are California and Washington State low and steady but, frankly, as I talked to governors and mayors today, I want to say to the American people that we — we are beginning to see the glimmers of progress.  The experts will tell me not to jump to any conclusions, and I’m not.  But like your President, I’m an optimistic person and I’m hopeful.
And the truth is, we’re starting to see cases and, most importantly, losses and hospitalizations begin to stabilize.  But make no mistake about it: I want to say to the American people, if that holds, if that’s happening, it’s because of what all of you are doing.  It’s because the American people are putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America.  You’re listening to your state and local officials.  You’re practicing social distancing.  You’re using drive-throughs instead of going into restaurants.
And so on behalf of your President and all of us who are working, really, at every level, I just want to say: Thank you, America.  Thank you for responding.  Thank you for putting other people’s lives in the forefront of your thinking, and putting it, again, over and above your own inconvenience and difficulty.
Because of your efforts, there is, as the President just said, light at the end of the tunnel.  And I’m absolutely convinced: With the continued cooperation, patience, persistence, and prayers of the American people, we’ll get through this, and we’ll get through this a lot sooner than we first thought it would take.

April 4, 2020
4:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a busy time.  Very busy time.  And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country.  We’re fighting for you and we’re enduring all of this together.  And we will soon prevail together.  We’re making a lot of progress.
We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states.  The relationships have been, really, very good.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo.  We’re working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible.
We — as you know, we took care of the hospital, including personnel — the 2,500 beds that we build just recently at Javits, including personnel.  And we opened it up to COVID, and that’s something that we also did in Louisiana, and we’re doing it in Dallas.
So we have a lot of not only hospitals being built, but now we’re manning the hospitals because states are, in many cases, unable to get additional people to work.  It’s — it’s just an incredible situation.  There’s never been anything like this.
One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available.  And we’ve got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world, and everybody will tell you that, and we’re dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151 — still, 151 nations are going through it.
We’re working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they’re needed, and in some cases, we’re telling governors we can’t go there because we don’t think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.  And pretty much, so far, we’ve been right about that.  And we’ll continue to do it.
As it really gets — this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week.  And there’ll be a lot of death, unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn’t done.  But there will be death.
We’re looking for an obvious focus in the hardest-hit regions.  Some of them are obvious and some aren’t so obvious.  They spring up.  They come and they — they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn’t at all bothered.  You look at what’s going on in New Jersey — the governor is doing an excellent job, by the way — but how that sprang up.
Every decision that we’re making is made to save lives.  It’s really our sole consideration.  We want to save lives.  We want as few lives lost as possible.  It’s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public.  It’s just incredible.  I could name them, but it’s the same ones.  Always the same ones.  I guess they’re looking for ratings.  I don’t know what they’re looking for.  So bad for our country and so bad — the people understand it.  You look at the levels and approval ratings, and they’re the lowest they’ve ever been for media.  It’s so bad for — for our country.  So bad for the world.  You ought to put it together for a little while, get this over with, and then go back to your fake news.
During a national emergency, it’s just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science.  Many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hotspots — you know what they are — are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs.  And at the current time, they’re really thrilled to be where they are.  Whenever local shortages are reported, we’re asking states to immediately meet the demand.  And we’re stockpiling large amounts in different areas — in different areas.  And we’re going to be discussing that in a little while.
But we want distributions to be made on a fair basis.  We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country.  But no matter where we’re — we’ve been there and we’ve been there very strongly.  I want to thank FEMA.  I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers.  I want to thank our military for what they’re doing.
And we’re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states — thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors.  And it’ll be a large number.  It’ll be — we’ll be telling them over the next very short period where they’re going.  And they’re going into war.  They’re going into a battle that they’ve never really trained for.  Nobody has trained for this; nobody has seen this, I would say, since 1917, which was the greatest of them all.  The greatest of this type of battle.  Probably the greatest of them all. Right?  1917.  Up to 100 million people were killed.
In addition, we’re working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized.  And that need changes.  One day it’s one state or one locale, one city.  And then all of a sudden, they’re starting to do well.  We had some very good reports coming out of the State of Washington, coming out of various parts of California — so, areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard.  We can now go to other areas.
It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard.  And Louisiana is just amazing the way it just sprang up.  And everyone is doing a good job but they’re going to be hit hard.
Areas in the country that are not experiencing large-scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require.  And we talk to them and we tell them and we explain it, and for the most part they’re good with it.  We think we’re right.
It’s very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests.  We have some states and areas where they’re just asking for far more.  I mean, look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators.  Forty thousand.  Think of it: 40,000.  It’s not possible.  They won’t need that many, and now they’re admitting they don’t need that many.  But we’re getting as many as we can to them.
Again, nobody has ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits.  But it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need, and it could intentionally and, you know — look, they — everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they’re 100 percent.  And sometimes, when they know they don’t need it, they want it anyway.  It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can’t do that.  It’s not even possible to think about it.
And that’s why — and we’re a backup.  Remember, we’re a backup.  We’re the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into the hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business, where you see we built many hospitals — numerous hospitals in some states — and medical centers.
That’s why my administration has been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the states and hospitals to meet their needs, because we want to be ready when — when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly; you see it.  You see it as sure as you can see it.  And when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it.  We don’t want to have spent everything in one area, and they don’t need it there to anywhere near the extent.
So let me be extremely clear about one point: We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens.  We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we’ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with.  We want to finish this war.  We have to get back to work.  We have to get — we have to open our country again.  We have to open our country again.  We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months.  We’re going to open our country again.  This country wasn’t meant for this.  Few were.  Few were.  But we have to open our country again.
I just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say, virtually all of the sports leagues: Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball; Roger Goodell Commissioner of the National Football League; Adam Silver Commissioner of the National Basketball Association; Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League; Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour; Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women’s National Basketball Association; Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship; Vince McMahon President of the WWE; Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer; Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR; Michael Whan, Commissioner of the LPGA; Roger Penske, Founder and Chairman Penske Corp.; and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders’ Cup.
And there were a couple of others on, and these are all the great leaders of sport.  And they want to get back.  They got to get back.  They can’t do this.  Their sports weren’t designed for it.  The whole concept of our nation wasn’t designed for it.  We’re going to have to get back.  We want to get back soon — very soon.
For example — and I have to say, we’re using the Defense Production Act very powerfully.  In some cas- — times directly; in many cases, indirectly.  Just the threat of it is usually enough.
But FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million — think of that — 180 million.  Who ever heard of 180 million N95 masks?  And we’re working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country.  And I think it’s going to be okay.  We’re going to soon let you know.  But we need the masks.  We don’t want other people getting it, and that’s why we’re — that’s why we’re instituting a lot of Defense Production Act, you could call it, retaliations because that’s what it is; it’s a retaliation.
If people don’t — if people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough, and we’ve been very tough.  Usually we don’t have to use it, but we’ve used it plenty.  It’s turning out more and more, unfortunately.  And it works very well.
Our Supply Chain Logistics Task Force, led by Admiral John Polowczyk, who’s doing a fantastic job, will ensure they’re distributed to the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements.  That’s the 60 million masks that we’re talking about and the hundred and — 180 million N95 masks.  A hundred and eighty million.  Who ever heard of 180 million masks?
And this is a incredible thing.  A lot of times — and we have to stop playing this game — if a governor wants 200 ventilators, and I say, “No, we’re going to send you 1,000.  We think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh, you got more.  Well, it’s not enough.  The President should have sent more.”  So he’s asking for 200.  We give him 1,000.  They say, “How’s the President doing?”  “He should have given more.”  Because that’s politics.  That’s politics.  And that’s unfortunate, because we can’t play that game.
And, you know, that’s one party doing it, and the other party is happy.  But they’re all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time.  Many of their cupboards were bare.
With respect to the ventilators, FEMA and HHS continue to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the states.  In order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies, we’ve been asking states to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates, because some states have more ventilators than they need.  They don’t even like to admit it.  They’ll admit it when everything is over, but that’s — it doesn’t help us very much.
This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time.  FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours.  They will have a whole different set of criteria.  Every day, it’s different criteria.  Every day, this horrible, invisible enemy changes a course.  It changes course.
If you were fighting the normal fight, you’d know what’s happening.  Here is: They hit one, they hit another, they hit another state.  They hit areas that you didn’t expect.  But we’re watching it and we’re capturing it.
Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real-time local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage.  So we have to be able to do that.  And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they’re not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones.  We have now 10,000 in our pipeline, and stockpiled 10,000 — close.
And we’re moving some into New York, so we’re going to need some additional.  We’re moving some into New York City and state, separately.  And we’re bringing them to the point where they’ll need them.
I can also report that, at my direction, 1,000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they’re needed the most.  That’s the hottest of all the hotspots.  New Jersey is right there.  It’s right next to it.  And I don’t know if that’s overflow, but New Jersey is — it’s a great state and it’s a very — it’s a crowded state also, where you have people on top of people.  It’s always tough.  But we’re bringing some of the ventilators.  We got some for New Jersey just yesterday, and we’re going to bring them some more, including doctors.
We’re getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists, and other support workers.  These are from the military.  We’re taking people now out of our military.  We’ve been doing it, but now we’re doing it on a larger basis.  And I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper, who will detail some of what we’re doing, tomorrow and Monday.
As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we’re returning a 300-bed federal medical station to a different location — so where we need it.  And we appreciate that.  They won’t be needing it, and we appreciate them letting us know.  We’re going to move it to a different location.  It was already built.
Many governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines.  They really have.
I’m also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending — they’re spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well, and they’re also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate.
And I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he’s doing every day, dealing with our nation’s governors.  Mike Pence has been working day and night on this, and we want to get it over.  He’s got to get a little more sleep than he’s getting.  He hasn’t been getting very much, I will tell you that.
And we’re all in this together, and it’s a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another.  They really are.
In addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation.  I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Boozman.  You know Senator Boozman; we all do.  He’s a great senator.  He’s a great person.  We spoke just this morning, and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors, and distributors in our nation’s prayers.  And I want to thank the senator for the incredible job he’s been doing.  And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone — everybody is working very hard.
My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection.  Working on a lot of things.  We must utilize our nation’s scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus.  We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can, because we have a lot of things happening in this country, and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work.
This week, the FDA established the Coronavirus Treatment Accelerator Program, which is expediting the development of new anti- — antiviral and other therapies, and they’re doing it on a very rapid basis.  And I think we’re having some very good results.  We’ll tell you about that.
HHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness.  And as you know, last Saturday, the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine.  And the hydroxychloroquine is a — I hope it’s going to be a very important answer.  We’re having some very good things happening with it, and we’re going to be distributing it through the Strategic National Stockpile.  It’s going into the Strategic National Stockpile to treat certain patients.  And we have millions and millions of doses of it; 29 million to be exact.
In addition to that, we’re making it and we’re also getting it from various other locations and countries.  In one case, I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning.  They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine — very large amounts, frankly.  And I said — they had a hold, because, you know, they have 1.5. billion people, and they think a lot of it.  And I said I’d appreciate it if they would release the amounts that we ordered.  And they are giving it serious consideration.  But they do make — India makes a lot of it.
But we have already 29 million.  If you look — I mean, that’s a big number.  Twenty-nine million doses.  And we’ve got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here, and it will be arriving.
We’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data.  But I’ll just speak for myself: It’s been out for a long time.  It’s a malaria drug.  It’s also a drug for lupus.  And there’s a — there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus.  They’re not — they’re not affected so much by it.  Now, maybe that’s correct; maybe it’s false.  You’re going to have to check it out.
But there’s a lot of very positive things happening with that.  That’s a game changer if that’s the case.  Obviously, we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months.  We’re doing great on the vaccines.  I think Johnson & Johnson is leading — seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we’ll see what happens.  But I feel good about that, but that’s down the road.
But tremendous promise with — with what’s just been mentioned.  In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that’s down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug remdesivir.  Now, it’s approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty — pretty good study.  Other drugs are also being studied in patients.
And this week, Oracle, a great company, donated a new web portal — Larry Ellison, amazing guy — and platform to the government to gather real-time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments.  And they have a very sophisticated site, we’ll be learning a lot from Oracle.  And thank you to them.
We’re also spending economic dollars like you wouldn’t believe, and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses.  Yesterday, the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers.  In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration, and over 1,200 lending partners, processed over 28,000 loans — it’s, so far, ahead of schedule — and billions and billions of dollars.
It’s worked out incredibly well, and I want to thank Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and a lot of the big banks that have been involved, and a lot of the community banks.  Community banks have really jumped on it.  And it’s, so far, going way ahead of schedule.
The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program — that’s great — as well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you’re familiar with, on the same terms as every other applicant.
If we run out of funding for the employee retention program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money.  This is money that’s really going directly to the people that need it — the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it.
Finally, I can — because when we open, we want to open strong, with businesses that are going.  Remember, we had the greatest economy in the world, and then one day, we were told we got to shut it down, stop it, tell everyone to stay home, because of this horrible virus.  And we did that, and we did the right thing.  But now we have to open.  We have to open our country.
Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries.  Many of those countries were terrific in helping us, and I appreciate that very much.
Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know.  And once I did, they snapped, like you wouldn’t believe.  They really helped us great.  So I appreciate that.  So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries, with no chance of getting out, and we got them back.  Four hundred flights, seventy-five countries.   Think of that.  And those countries, in almost every instance, had a big problem with the virus.
I want to thank the American people, most of all, for the selfless sacrifices that they’re making for our nation.  I know it’s not pleasant, although some people have said they’ve gotten to know their family better, and they love their family more than ever, and that’s a beautiful thing.  They’ve actually gotten to know them.  They’re in the same house with their family for a long time.  I guess it can also work the other way, perhaps, but we don’t want to talk about that.
And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread.  Sustaining this war effort is — and that’s what it is; this is a war effort — is the patriotic duty of every citizen.  While we may be more physically distant for a time, we’re closer together in the heart and in the spirit.
And through this, great national unity is happening.  We’re having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn’t think would be possible to develop like this.
And we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might.  We’re doing really well, and I’m very proud of everybody out there.  We’re very proud of you.  It’s something that nobody could have ever projected.  It’s been over 100 years that a thing like this has happened.
And the problem with this one is the contagion.  It’s so contagious.  Nobody has ever seen anything like that where it’s so contagious.  You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it.  You can catch it.  You know how long it can live on surfaces.  So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion.
So, we’re getting there.  We’re going to make sure that it’s over soon.  And just keep going.  It’s not going to be long.
And thank you very much.  And with that, I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak.  And he’s been doing yeoman’s work at the FDA.
Thank you very much.  Doctor, thank you.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m going to speak about hydroxychloroquine and the efforts around that.  Just to preface, I’d like to echo what the President said about the American people and the resiliency and the just terrific work.  Mitigation is such an important part of our fight against the COVID-19 virus.
Last week, as the President said, we issued an emergency use authorization to allow the donated hydroxychloroquine to come into the country and enter the general circulation.  We are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials, and also into general use for physicians, because as you know, physicians, based upon their interaction with the patients, their assessment of the risks and benefits can write a prescription for hydroxychloroquine if they think it’s appropriate for the patient.  Being a physician, we do this all the time.  And that assessment needs to be done between a patient and a doctor.
And then the third portion is we wanted to make sure that these drugs were in the circulation — in the supply chain, so that people who have them or need them for the other indications — lupus, rheumatoid arthritis — had them available.  So that was the purpose of the emergency use authorization.
One other thing I’d like to mention is that we, on Friday, stood up a formal convalescent plasma program.  We have a great deal of enthusiasm for that.  There are some reports that this is a benefit to patients in other countries who have had the COVID-19 virus.
And what this means is taking plasma from patients who have had the virus and who have recovered, and transferring the immunity — the immunoglobulins, if you will — the immunity from that person to someone who’s sick.  And we’re hopefully expanding that across the country.  The Red Cross is involved in that program.  And I think it shows a great promise.  It needs to be studied like other things.  But just like I said before, it provides hope.  We don’t want to provide false hope, but definitely hope.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Tony, please.
MR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I’d like to just take a couple of moments to talk a little bit about the public health aspects and how it relates to what the President just said about the need for us to begin to at least think about returning to some degree of normality.  And that has to do with what’s going to be happening as we end this week and we go into next week.
You will be seeing — and we should not be surprised because the kinetics of how this virus works — is that we’re going to be seeing that there are going to be deaths that are going to continue to go up.  But as I mentioned to this group and to the general public multiple times, there really is a cascading of events where you have new cases, hospitalizations, intensive care, and deaths.  So at the same time that we may be seeing an increase in deaths, we want to focus on the effective mitigation is really the number of new cases.  And that’s what we’re going to be thinking about and looking about.
So we’re going to pay close attention to that, and hopefully the kinds of mitigations that we’re talking about are going to have the impact to allow us to begin to think about maybe changing a bit.
So the question arises is: Is the mitigation working?  So let’s look historically and then just look at the reality of it.  Clearly, in the countries — China included — that have implemented very strict kinds of programs of mitigation, clearly it works.  In our own country, we’ve seen indication of that in Washington.  Remember, Washington State was the first to get hit.  But they put in a really good program of mitigation.  And if you look at the charts that Dr. Birx showed the other day, they’re still down, they’re doing well.
And the reason is — again, what I’ve said before, but I think it’s worth reiterating — that we have two opposing forces here: the virus, which wants to do what the virus wants to do.  Viruses transmit from people to people.  When people are separated from each other, virus does not transmit; it doesn’t go anywhere.  And that’s the reason why something as simple as the physical separation — because if you look at the Vice President’s chart that he shows all the time here from this podium, every aspect of that, ending the COVID outbreak in 30 days, has some aspect of it, a physical separation — whether that’s avoiding crowds, whether that staying six feet away from people, whether that’s doing teleworking.  All of it does that.  That’s our most important tool.  We’ll be talking about vaccines and drugs and things like that that will mitigate later.  But this is what we really have to do.
And I want to — I want to actually just plea, as I do multiple times from here, to the American public: You know, as sobering and as difficult as this is, what we are doing is making a difference.  So we really need to continue to do that.
I must tell you, I was just mentioning to the Vice President as we came in: Last night, when I wasn’t here, I went out with my wife and actually did a little powerwalking down Massachusetts Avenue — for those who live in Washington, know what I’m talking about — and we passed a couple of restaurants where people were getting takeout food.  The restaurants were closed to people going in, but they were open to takeout.
And I saw something that absolutely made me feel really, really good.  They were separating themselves by at least six feet.  In fact, some of the restaurants had little things on the floor that said, “Stand here” and then “Stand there.”
And I think if we as a nation pulled together to do that, hopefully when we keep coming back here at these press conferences, we’ll be able to show you that that curve that we keep talking about is going in the right direction.

5:25 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  I just had a meeting with Kevin McCarthy, future Speaker of the House, I hope.  And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California.  And also, the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you look at the — at the bump.  You take a look at the bump and how they’re doing out there.  So I congratulate everybody out there.
But I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words.  So, Kevin, please.
LEADER MCCARTHY:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And I would like to thank you.  On the basis of California, Governor Newsom says the work that you’re doing together has been — you’re working very closely — has been effective in California as well — the Vice President and the President.
You know, today, Mr. President, I want to thank you, especially for the work that Secretary Mnuchin has done, especially for small businesses.  Just today alone, I saw Bank of America had more than 10,000 loans in two hours.
And for anybody who’s in small business — My first small business was when I was 20 years old.  You don’t have income coming in right now, you get a loan, but for your rent, paying your employees, and paying your utilities is a grant.  That’s part of the CARES Act.  And I think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back, keep them afloat through the next two months, and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus.  So I just want to thank you for all that work.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job you’re doing.
LEADER MCCARTHY:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  You go ahead.  I’ll talk to you later.
Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America.  That seems to be the hotspot right now.  But you have some others, as you know, that are very — very bad.  Very bad.  Louisiana is getting hit very hard.  Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard.  New Jersey is — is –surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought.  They’re doing a really good job.  The governor is doing a really good job out there.
New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure.  They’re the best in the world.  We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource — financial, medical, scientific.  We will not spare anything.  We’ll get it back into shape.
The Empire State — the governor is doing an excellent job.  They’re all working very hard together.  At the request of the governor, as you know, the Javits Center, we have 2,500 beds, and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after, the patients can be looked after.  That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents.  And, you know, it’s very interesting, the governor is telling me we don’t have too many accidents and very few people driving.
So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility.  The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.
And today, also, the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus.  From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood.  So you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred.
In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure.  So it’s voluntary; you don’t have to do it.  They suggested for a period of time.  But this is voluntary.  I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.
But you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.  Probably material that you’d have at home.  These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.
I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job.  Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services.
The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time.  Again, we’re going to all come back together here.  We’re going to all come back together.  And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.
A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.  Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.  One of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.  And said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.  So maybe it’ll stay.  Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.  But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.
So with the masks, it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing.  You can do it.  You don’t have to do it.  I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that’s okay.  It may be good.  Probably will.  They’re making a recommendation.  It’s only a recommendation.  It’s voluntary.
We’re also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.  The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays — which is really something; that’s a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.  Those are great companies, and they’re all doing the same thing.  So, co-pays.  For them to do that is — it’s a big statement.  We appreciate it.
Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.  So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.  This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.  So that’s, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.
I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.
The security and Secretary — the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.  We need these items immediately for domestic use.  We have to have them.  But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items, and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.
We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.  Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles — many, many, many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.  All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.  Most of it has already been given out.  And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.
In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.  Department of Defense.  And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City.  Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.  And they were very grateful.  8.1 million.  And we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.  That’s a lot of N95 respirators.
Today, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans.  They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them.
The CEO of Ochsner, Warner Thomas — who’s really been fantastic, I have to say — indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns.  And I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow.  So they’ll have the 230,000.  That’s Louisiana — New Orleans.  Two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns; they’ll have them by tomorrow.
We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military.  And we are in a war.  The invisible enemy — remember.
Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits, where we take it over.  And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get people — more people in the New York area.  So we’re going to have it manned by the military — Javits Center.
National Guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies.  That includes National Guard.  The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies.  So I’ve given approval to use the National Guards — the various National Guards in the different states.  And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material.
The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states: in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington Wisconsin, Ohio.  They’re doing a lot of work in just those states, plus additionals, that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow.  But they’re doing some job.  The Army Corps of Engineers — what a job they’re doing.  And FEMA — what a job they’re doing.
As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers.  We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus.  And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings.  Hydroxychloroquine — I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results.  I hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing.
But we have it right now in — approximately now, it’s increased to 1,500 people.  I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York — terrific guy, by the way.  He’s — we’re doing a good job.  And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it.  So it’s been there for about three and a half days, but I think — and many other places it’s being tested too.  And we have a tremendous supply of it.  We’ve ordered it in the case that it works.  And it’s — it could have some pretty big impacts.  And we’ll see what happens.
My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses.  On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5. billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time.
And Bank of America has been incredible.  Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks.  And we’re already at $3.5 billion going out to incredible people.  But that’s way ahead of schedule.
The SBA and the Treasury are working around the clock, and our banking partners are really incredible.  And they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible, and then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go, and now they’ll keep them.  And that’s good.  And then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees.  And we’ll try and get back to where we were.  Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.
The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis.  This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.  I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time.
There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus.  The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil.  So we’re working with our great energy companies.  These are great companies.  They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  And they’ve kept America really going for a long time.  And no big price hikes, no big anything.  I mean, they’ve just kept it going.  And now they got hit.  But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.
America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.  Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.  And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.  So stay at home.  This is ending.  This will end.  You’ll see some bad things and then you’re going to see some really good things.  And it’s not going to be too long.
We will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus.
And with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up, Vice President, and say a few words.  And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.
And it’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C., and our country is a great place, and we’re getting better.  We’re getting better very quickly.
This was artificially induced.  We just said — they said, “Close it down.  You have to close it down.”  We closed it down and we’re healing.  We’re going to get it better fast.
So, Mike, if you could come up say a few words.  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The President just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
In addition, some good news Dr. Deborah Birx will reflect on in a moment.  And some of the areas across America where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts — the American people putting into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines — are having a positive effect.
In fact, today, California and Washington State, where the coronavirus first emerged in our country, remain — the cases remain at a steady but low rate.  And we know, as Governor Newsom said yesterday, that they’re not out of the woods yet.  We continue to flow resources.
But we want to commend people in those states and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing and all the measures that state and local leaders are advising and that — and that the President has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for America.
We’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in New York State, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, and Boston.  And as the President indicated, we’re prioritizing resources to support healthcare workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities.
On the subject of testing, now more than 1.4 million tests have been performed across the country.  And as you all are aware, some 266,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus.
Abbott instruments, which now can perform a 15-minute test across the country, have literally 18,000 of their machines across the nation today.  But at the President’s direction, FEMA is acquiring over 1,200 more machines to distribute to every state public health lab in America and also to our Indian Healthcare Service.
And the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA — once again, in near record time — has approved an antibody test developed by Cellex.  And we’re continuing on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests and these innovative new tests not just to meet this moment, but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead.
As the President mentioned, he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation.
We also have held a teleconference today with commercial retailers.  On the President’s behalf, we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for America.  It’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries.  But I heard — I heard from them their — their patriotic commitment to put the health of their associates and their customers first.  And it was deeply inspiring.
On the subject of supplies, the President detailed our work in that space.  It continues to this day.  As part of our air bridge, we had a flight arrive from China today to Columbus, Ohio.  We continue to work each and every day, watching the data about cases, to ensure that, in particular, not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the frontlines, but also that ventilators are available as the — as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities.  We are literally working hour by hour, day by day to make sure that patients, families, and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need.
As the President mentioned, we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the Paycheck Protection Program today.
We have available for questions the head of the CDC today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings.
And Secretary Azar, in a few moments, will explain just how the President’s decision to make sure that no American will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment.
I’m pleased to report, at the President’s direction, Medicaid and Medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on.
And of course, the President just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving co-pays on testing, but they’re now waiving co-pays for at least 60 days on any coronavirus treatment.
But now, as Secretary Azar will enumerate, now we’ll make sure that any American, even those that have no insurance, will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill.
I’ll just give a general reminder to every American: There is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America.  Every American has a role to play.  And I want to thank you on behalf of the President and all of the American people for the way that you’re stepping forward, you’re engaging in the social distancing, and doing the things that will slow the spread.
We encourage you to keep on keeping on.  And we will get through this, America.  We will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health and renewed prosperity that the President always describes.  But we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you Mr. Vice President, Mr. President.  Thank you for your words of discipline and determination.  I guess that really describes what we’re asking every American to really be: disciplined about these guidelines and really determined to stay in that space of execution.
You know we are just in week three on — of this full guidance measure.  We really do appreciate the work of the citizens of California and Washington State, because we do see that their curve is different.  Their curve is different from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  And we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers.
We also are deeply grateful, despite the way their curve looks today, they continue to get ready for a different potential, so that they can ensure that patients, if they do get sick, have options and availability.
To all the frontline healthcare workers in the — what we have referred to as “hot zones” — areas where the number of cases are quite significant — the New Orleans; the New York City metro area, including New Jersey and Connecticut — the incredible work that the frontline healthcare workers are providing.  We’re really working now at a much more granular level, talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments.
And to work — I think we discussed it yesterday, but I think it was quite clear also — and reiterated by Governor Cuomo today — that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas, and other areas, move through their peak of new infections.
When we talked about it at the beginning of this week, we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult.  And we want to recognize the number of Americans who have lost their lives to this virus, and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care, but I think I’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital.
We continue to watch, in addition, the Chicago area, the Detroit area, and have some developing concerns around Colorado, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania.  So as you can see, each of these will follow their own curves.  We’ll be getting more and more of those case, over time, information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states, counties, and communities move through this together in solidarity, and really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers but also every American who needs our support right now.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus.  First, I want to thank all of the members of the HHS team and the frontline healthcare workers across America, including those who — those service workers who serve in our hospitals, at our healthcare facilities, those who clean, those who deliver, those who stock the shelves — all those who are going into battle every day against the virus.  Your country has asked you to serve as never before, and you have responded heroically.
I’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured.  Getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for President Trump.  We are already rolling out the $1 billion in funding from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to cover providers’ expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured.
The CARES Act, signed by the President, includes another $100 billion for healthcare providers.  Under the President’s direction, we will use a portion of that funding to cover providers’ costs of delivering COVID-19 care for the uninsured, sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing.
As a condition of receiving funds under this program, providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care.  Providers will be reimbursed at Medicare rates.
We will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the $100 billion will go to providers.  We’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast, fair, simple, and transparent.
I’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage, you have insurance options that you should look into.  You’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges, and depending on your state, you may be eligible for Medicaid.
Just as President Trump is working to ensure that COVID-19 treatment is paid for, he’s working to support new treatment options for patients.  Thanks to the President’s leadership, many providers are trying different experimental therapies, and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working.
Today, Oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowd-sourced, real-time information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics.  While this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials, it gives us data rapidly.  If you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us, you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work.  There’s a special registration page for providers at COVID19.Oracle.com.
Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Okay, let’s go.  Steve?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-18/

April 2, 2020
5:22 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Good to be with you all.  We’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus.  It’s vital that every American follows our guidelines on the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”  The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved.  We’re going to save a lot of American lives.  And we’re in control of our own fate very much so.  Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene, and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger.
While you’re fighting this battle from home, we’re working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world.  We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus, as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine.  And we’re making a lot of progress.  I think, medically, a lot of progress.
At the same time, we’re also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know.  I want to remind small-business owners across America that the Paycheck Protection Program is launching tomorrow.  Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses, including sole proprietors.  These loans are up to 100 percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers.  Got to take care of your workers.
Furthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens.  The Treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts.  And don’t forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare, and your Medicaid.  We’re protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and I always will.
I’d like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, who’s doing a fantastic job — she’s going to be very busy in the next little while — and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives.  And then we’ll get on to the attack of the virus itself.
And please, if I might, Steve and Jovita.
ADMINISTRATOR CARRANZA:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, Secretary Mnuchin, Ivanka Trump, and all who I have been working closely with in this effort.  Small Business is the backbone of the American economy, and the President has put the nation’s 30 million small businesses front and center in the response effort, and we are working hard to get money to them quickly.
This is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses, and we know that there will be challenges in the process.  Secretary Mnuchin and I are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented.
The private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first.  This administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business, you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country.  And your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees.
At SBA, we are working around the clock to support small businesses, ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation.
This relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their day-to-day operating expenses.
Today I want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the Paycheck Protection Program and how they can benefit from this.  Simply put, the Paycheck Protection Program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open.  SBA will forgive the portion of the loan that is used toward job retention and certain other expenses.  We are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders.
The Paycheck Protection Program is in addition to substantial work that the SBA has and will continue to do to help small businesses, including providing advances on SBA disaster loans and forgiving existing SBA loan payments over the next six months.
Additional details on these critically important programs can be found at SBA.gov.  And we will be updating these resources regularly.
Our hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus.  Our communities around the country are stepping up, and we will get through this together.
At SBA, we know that every phone call, email, or application submitted has a small-business owner, their employees, and the communities they support around the other side.  Our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption.
I want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit.  We will continue working around the clock, as we’ve done, with our federal and private sector partners, expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Jovita.  Very good.  Thank you.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Jovita.  Mr. President, you’ve made it clear to us we now need to execute.  We need to get money to small business and American workers, and that’s what we’re doing.
The SBA and Treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow.  And when Jovita says people are working around the clock, they literally — we had both teams working until 4 o’clock in the morning and start working again today.
We’ve heard feedback from lenders, community banks, regional banks, and we spent the last 24 hours making this system even easier.
So this will be up and running tomorrow.  I encourage all small businesses that have 500 or fewer people, please contact your lenders.  Any FDIC institution will be able to do this; any credit union, existing SBA lenders, and fintech lenders.
You get the money.  You’ll get it the same day.  You use this to pay your workers.  Please bring your workers back to work.  If you’ve let them go, you have eight weeks, plus overhead.  This is a very important program.
I’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans — and again, the interest rate is paid for as part of the program; the borrower doesn’t have to pay this — to 1 percent.  We had announced it was going to be 50 basis points.  We’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs — even though the government is borrowing at three or four basis points — this is, on average, a 90-day loan.  To make this attractive for community banks, we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate.
Again, I encourage everybody: Take out the Paycheck Protection Program.
I’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments.  I had previously said this would take us three weeks.  I’m pleased to report that, within two weeks, the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayers’ account.
And as the President said last night, the President authorized me to say that anybody that has Social Security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return, and we’ll have that.  If we don’t have your direct deposit information, we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up.  It is a very large priority.  The President has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands.
I’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve.  We’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the “Main Street” lending facility.  We’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well.
And I’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit — it’s up and running.  The first $10,000 of wages, you get a 50 percent credit; that’s $5,000 per person.  For everyone who’s kept someone, you can immediately get that money; you can deduct it from what you owe the IRS immediately.  If you don’t owe us money, you’ll get a refundable tax credit.  So that is up and running.
I’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running.  We’re taking applications from the airlines, from the cargo companies, and from national security companies.
So thank you very much, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Steve.  For Jovita or Steve, any questions, please?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-17/

5:35 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much everybody.  Thank you.  So, America continues to wage all-out war to defeat the virus — this horrible, horrible virus.  You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday.  And we explained why we’re extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread by 30 days.
Together, we have the power to save countless lives.  We’re attacking the virus on every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation, and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people.  And we did that early — far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else.
In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory.  As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there’s a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain.  And we must not let that happen.  We will never let that happen.
Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics.  We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives.
In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption, and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace.  We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft, and helicopters; Coast Guard cutters; and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region.  Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment, and we’ve taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy.
Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien will provide more details.  In addition, I’m going to have General Milley, who has done an incredible job in so many ways, say a few words.  And also with us: our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know — I think you know; and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz.
So I’m going to ask Mark to start and then we can go.  And after that, we’re going to take questions as it pertains to this.  And then we’ll go onto phase two, which is the virus itself.  Okay?
Thank you, please.  Mark.
SECRETARY ESPER:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon, everyone.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here today as we make this very important announcement.  At a time when the nation and the Department of Defense are focused on protecting the American people from the spread of the coronavirus, we also remain vigilant to the many other threats our country faces.
Today, at the President’s direction, the Department of Defense, in close cooperation with our interagency partners, began enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.  This initiative is part of the administration’s whole-of-government approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and protecting the American people from their scourge.
I want to thank all of our partners in this effort, to include the United States Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice, and members of the intelligence community for their tremendous support and cooperation.
To conduct these enhanced operations, the President has directed the deployment of additional ships, aircraft, and security forces to the United States Southern Command Area of Responsibility.  Included in this force package are Navy destroyers and littoral combat ships, Coast Guard cutters, P-8 patrol aircraft, and elements of an Army Security Force Assistance Brigade.  These additional forces will nearly double our capacity to conduct counter-narcotics operations in the region.
Additionally, 22 partner nations have joined us in this fight, bringing with them a variety of intelligence and operations capabilities needed to defeat these criminal organizations.
Last year alone, United States Southern Command’s operations resulted in the seizure of over 280 metric tons of drugs, much of which was designated for shipment to America.
While this was an incredible achievement, there’s much more work to be done.  Transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten our security by smuggling cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamines, and other narcotics across our borders.  These drug traffickers put our communities — communities at risk and destroy lives.  Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdose and thousands more suffer the harmful effects of addiction.
Furthermore, corrupt actors, like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, rely on the profits derived from the sale of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power.  The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro’s criminal control over the country.
Drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness by increasing their illicit activities.  We must do more to prevent these drugs from arriving at our shores.  These enhanced counter-narcotics operations that are now underway will further disrupt the flow of illicit drugs to America, deny our adversaries the financial resources they depend on, and build the capacity of our partner nations throughout the region.
I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and support to this critical mission.  This is a particularly important time for this operation to begin, as nations around the world shift their focus inward to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, many criminal organizations are attempting to capitalize on this crisis.  The enhanced operations we’re announcing today will keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect the American people from the devastation caused by the flow of illegal drugs into our country.
Mr.  President, thank you for your leadership as we begin this important operation.  While the men and women of the United States military work hard here at home to fight the coronavirus, we continue to take action around the world to defend our great country.
Thank you and I’d like to invite General Milley.
GENERAL MILLEY:  Thank you, Secretary, for those words.  And thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  And I want to publicly thank Admiral Craig Faller, the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command out of Miami, for leading this operation, which is underway effective today; and also Admiral Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations, and Admiral Schultz for their contributions to this from their services.  There’s thousands of sailors, Coast Guardsmen, soldiers, airmen, Marines involved in this operation.
We came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels, as a result of COVID-19, were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country.  As we know, 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs.  That’s unacceptable.  We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists, and we are at war with the drug cartels as well.
This is the United States military.  You will not penetrate this country.  You will not get past Jump Street.  You’re not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.  And we will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans.
So, right now, the Navy has marshalled additional grey-hull ships from both PACOM and EUCOM and for the naval fleet at Norfolk.  And they are set sail already and they are in the Caribbean right now.  In addition to that, there’s 10 Coast Guard cutters and there’s Special Operations Forces and Security Force Assistance Brigades, along with Air Force reconnaissance aircraft.
The bottom line is: You’re not going to get through.  Now is not the time to try to penetrate the United States with illegal drugs to kill Americans.  We’re the United States military and we will defend our country, regardless of the cost.
Thank you, Mr.  President.  Thank you, Secretary.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, General.  Beautiful.  Thank you.
Bill.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:  Thank you, Mr.  President, and thanks for your decisive leadership as we confront this unprecedented challenge posed by corona- — coronavirus.  I’d like to thank you for your support for this important initiative and thank all of — the Secretary of Defense and all the services for taking on this — this important initiative.
Obviously, during this crisis, we’re all focused above all else on COVID-19.  But at the same time, our law enforcement and national security work must go forward, protecting the American people from the full array of threats.
For the Department of Justice, one of our highest priorities must remain destroying the Mexican cartels.  Their trafficking is largely responsible for the deaths, as we all know now, of 70,000 Americans a year.  And also the costs of this don’t count the destroyed families, the destroyed lives, the draining of our national treasure as state budgets are crushed by the burden that this — this narcotic trafficking causes.
The President has made clear that we are in this fight against the cartels to win, and that we are not interested in half measures, and that the threat posed by the cartel is not just a law enforcement threat, but a national security threat as well.
And, in December, building on your success with the Mexican President in forging a cooperative relationship in the area of immigration, you asked me to go down and meet with the President López Obrador and our Mexican counterparts to see if we could also establish a more comprehensive and coordinated effort with the Mexicans in confronting the cartels.  And we’ve had some successful visits and discussions, and currently have an array of activities underway against the cartels.  And we anticipate, along with the Mexicans, that these are going to bear fruit in the months ahead.
But it quickly became clear that we can obtain the most immediate results, the best bang for the buck, where we increase the assets involved in interdiction on both the Pacific and Atlantic side of Mexico in the Central American countries.  For years, the cartels have been using these sea routes to take the cocaine up from, principally, Colombia — now also out of Venezuela.  And these sea routes on both coasts have become the primary means of bringing cocaine up to the United States.
Because of the superb work done by the Defense Department and our intelligence community, we know exactly, most of the time, where these traffickers are at sea.  But we’re significantly — have been up until now significantly limited in our ability to interdict because of the numbers of the assets we have deployed.
Prior today, this limitation meant we could only intercept a fraction of the traffickers that — and the various boats that were detected.  This will now double our capacity, and we are talking about hundreds of tons of cocaine now — we’re now in a position to seize.
So this is going to radically improve our interdiction efforts and put tremendous pressure, we think, on the cartels.  And the effort that SOUTHCOM is undertaking is going to save lives by taking drugs off the street.
Last week, I announced the unsealing of charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and other crimes against the former Maduro regime — 16 members of that regime — and their involvement in trafficking of 250 metric tons a year.  A lot of that comes by sea, as I discussed at that time.
But also, because of the pressure we’re applying by our sea interdiction, they are trying to establish an air route out of Venezuela, up into Central America, which is one of the reasons we’re trying to move firmly against that corrupt regime.
You know, this drug war has gone on for many decades.  And at times in the past, we’ve had great success and great results.  And at times, we’ve taken our eye off the ball — fortunately, not in this administration.  And I’m grateful that you, Mr. President, have brought focus to this fight and the determination to use whatever tools are necessary to win the fight.  The cartels have to be defeated, both for the people of this country and for the people of Mexico and Venezuela.
So I’d like to thank you again, Mr. President, Secretary Esper, for providing the wherewithal required to help win this war against the cartels and others who seek to send illicit drugs into our country.
And, with that, I’d like to introduce Ambassador O’Brien.
AMBASSADOR O’BRIEN:  Thank you, General.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Today’s action is another example of the bold leadership of President Trump and his commitment to protecting the homeland against threats that seek to destabilize the United States and our Western Hemisphere.
The uncontrolled flow of illegal drugs into the United States poisons our communities; fuels the dangerous epidemic — epidemic of addiction; and threatens the safety and security of all Americans.
The impressive U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and interagency operation will address a range of threats to our national security posed by narco-traffickers and narco-terrorists.
It will reduce illicit financial support for the drug traffic- — for drug trafficking that provides the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela and other bad actors with the funds necessary to conduct their malign activities.
Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to execute our maximum pressure policy to counter the Maduro regime’s malign activities, including drug trafficking.  And this operation will help to choke off the funds that go to that corrupt regime.
Maduro, narco-terrorists, and criminals should make no mistake that even as we are working around the clock to fight the spread of coronavirus, we will continue to execute the President’s counter-narcotics strategy.
We’re working on a number of important national security priorities as we face this public health crisis.  The United States will continue to combat disinformation and fake news about this virus.  We will work with the world’s largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets.  We will always protect our servicemen and servicewomen around the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
I want the American people to know that President Trump and Vice President Pence and their administration are working tirelessly every day to protect the health and well-being of Americans and respond to the coronavirus.
Our adversaries should take note however: This President has a clear-eyed focus on America’s national security’s — security interest.  And let me be clear, it would be a mistake — a mistake with terrible consequences — for any adversary to attempt to do us harm during this health crisis — or ever, for that matter.
Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  So do we have any questions on this?  Because this group is going to go back to work.  They’re going to leave.
John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-16/

5:30 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Our country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before.  You all see it.  You see it probably better than most.
We’re at war with a deadly virus.  Success in this fight will require the full, absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion.  Very important.
Each of us has the power, through our own choices and actions, to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us.
That’s why we really have to do what we all know is right.  Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices.  Every business is being asked to fulfill its patriotic duty.  Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work, and interact each and every day.
And I wouldn’t be surprised to see this going on long into the future, when this virus is gone and defeated.  Some of the things we’re doing now will be very good practice for the future, including for not getting the flu, which is very devastating also.  So some of what we’re learning now will live on into the future — I really believe that: shaking hands or not shaking hands; washing hands all the time; staying a little apart.
Fifteen days ago, we published our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread of the virus.  On Sunday, I announced that this campaign will be extended until April 30th.
In a few moments, Dr. Birx will explain the data that formed the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines, and Dr. Fauci will explain why it’s absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days.  It’s a matter of life and death, frankly.  It’s a matter of life and death.
I know our citizens will rise to the occasion, and they already have sacrificed a lot.  We had the greatest economy in the history of our country.  We had the greatest economy in the world.  We had the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers that we’ve ever had, by far.  And in one instant, we said we have no choice but to close it up.  Just as Americans have always done, they will do a job like few have seen before.  And they’re proud to do it, and I see that.  There’s a great pride going on right now.
Before we hear from our experts, we have a few other announcements.  Today, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration announced further details on the Paycheck Protection Program, which was made possible by the 2-trillion-dollar relief bill I signed into law last week.  Nearly $350 billion in loans will soon be available through lending partners to help small businesses meet payroll and other expenses for up to two months.  These loans will be forgiven as long as businesses keep paying their workers.  This includes sole proprietors and independent contractors.  Applications will be accepted starting this Friday, April 3rd.  So, on Friday, April 3rd, that’s when it begins.
Earlier today, I spoke with leading Internet and phone providers who are doing a tremendous job of keeping our Internet and lines of communication flowing under very strongly increased strain.  The business is more than anybody has seen before, because everyone is inside.  They’re all making calls.
Among the leaders I spoke to were Hans Vestberg of Verizon Communications, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Mike Sievert of T-Mobile, Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications, Brian Roberts of Comcast, John Malone of Liberty Media, Dexter Goei of Altice, Michel Combes of Sprint, and Aryeh Bourkoff of LionTree.  Also, Pat Esser of Cox Communications and Jeffrey Storey of CenturyLink.  They’re doing an incredible job.
If you look at other continents — if you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did, and much different route.  We were talking about that just a little while ago.  And they’re having tremendous problems.  Other countries are having problems.  Other continents are having problems.
But with business at a level that nobody has seen it before on the Internet, it’s holding up incredibly well, and they expect that to continue no matter what happened and no matter how much more it gains, which, if it can gain more than it already is, I don’t know, because they’re setting records.
Let me also update you on the distribution of urgently needed resources and supplies.  And we have a lot of numbers.  I’m going to let Mike Pence speak to that in a little while.  But we’re giving massive amounts of medical equipment and supplies to the 50 states.  We also are holding back quite a bit.  We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go.  We have to hold them back because the surge is coming, and it’s coming pretty strong.  And we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it.
So, we’re ready to go, and we’ve also distributed — I just spoke with the governor of Michigan.  Had a great conversation.  And we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan.  We’re sending them to Louisiana.  We sent additional ventilators to New York, additional ventilators to New Jersey.
And, I will say, in New York, FEMA is supplying 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs to help respond to the increasing caseload.  That’s a lot of ambulances.
In California, the Army Corps of Engineers is developing eight facilities to expand hospital capacity up to 50,000 beds.  Fifty thousand.  And had a great conversation last night with Gavin Newsom.  He’s doing — he’s doing a really good job.  We — we’re in constant communications.  The USNS Mercy hospital ship is operational.  It’s in Los Angeles and receiving patients.
And, in New York, as you know, the Comfort — everybody watched that — it’s in place and will be, in a very short while, receiving large numbers of patients.  Over a thousand rooms and 12 operating rooms.
FEMA has also provided 100 travel trailers to assist with housing needs.  And we’re ordering hundreds more.
In Michigan, FEMA will soon deliver, in addition to the ventilators, 250-bed field hospital, and Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating locations to build alternate care facilities.  So we’re doing a field hospital, in Michigan, of 250 beds.  And we may be doubling it up soon, depending on the need.  They’re doing a good job with beds in Michigan, but they may need more than the 250.  So, FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers are prepared to go there quickly and get it done.
In Louisiana, we’re delivering two field hospitals to provide 500 new hospital beds.  I’ve been talking with the governor, John Bel Edwards, and the Army Corps of Engineers has been really doing incredible work, establishing 3,000-bed alternate care site at the New Orleans Convention Center, which will be operational, believe it or not, this week.  So we’re doing a 3,000-bed alternate care site, and we’re also doing a 500-bed new hospital.  And that’s in Louisiana, which really got hit.  It started off very late, and it was looking good, and then all of a sudden, it just reared up; it came from nowhere.
In addition to the supplies we’re delivering, we’re also giving hospitals the flexibility to use new facilities, including surgical care centers, to care for hospital patients who are not infected.  For example, I know that many expectant mothers are understandably concerned about exposing their newborn babies to the virus, and they should be.  With our action yesterday, hospitals now have the authority to create special areas for mothers to deliver their babies in a very safe and healthy environment.  Totally separate.
Over the past two months, the U.S. State Department has organized one of the largest and most complex international evacuation operations in American history.  Mike Pompeo has been working round the clock, along with Ambassador O’Brien.  Since January 29th, we have successfully repatriated over 25,000 Americans from more than 50 countries, where they were literally stuck — in some cases, locked in.
And I salute the incredible public servants at the Department of State, as well as their counterparts at DHS and HHS who have played such an important role in doing this.  You probably read about the young people in Peru and young people in Brazil, and they were absolutely stuck, and we got them out.  Got them — almost everybody is out now, back home with their parents, their wives, their husbands.
I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead.  We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks.  And then, hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting, after having studied it so hard, you’re going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel.  But this is going to be a very painful — a very, very painful two weeks.
When you look and see, at night, the kind of death that’s been caused by this invisible enemy, it’s incredible.  I was watching, last night, Governor Murphy of New Jersey say “29 people died today,” meaning yesterday, and others talking about numbers far greater.  But you get to know a state.  I know New Jersey so well, and you hear 29 people.  And hundreds in other locations.  Hundreds in other states.  And this is going to be a rough two-week period.
As a nation, we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that — that really important day when we’re going to see things get better, all of a sudden.  And it’s going to be like a burst of light, I really think and I hope.
Our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve.  This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part.
I appreciate a lot of the media.  We’ve had a lot of really good things said.  I think only good things can be said when you look at the job that’s been done.
I just spoke with Franklin Graham who is an extraordinary person.  And Samaritan’s Purse has been — like so many others — just been amazing and so fast.  They did it so fast.  He’s been doing that for a long time, but I think people are really seeing what they have done.  Franklin Graham — a very special family.
As we send planeloads of masks and gloves and supplies to the communities battling the plague — and that’s what it is; this a plague — we also send our prayers.  We pray for the doctors and the nurses, for the paramedics and the truck drivers, and the police officers and the sanitation workers, and, above all, the people fighting for their lives in New York and all across our land.
I watched as doctors and nurses went into a certain hospital in Elmhurst this morning.  I know Elmhurst, Queens.  That’s — I grew up right next to it.  I know the hospital very well.  And seeing it all my life — my young life.  And I will tell you that to see the scenes of trailers out there and what they’re doing with those trailers — they’re freezers — and nobody can even believe it.
And I spoke to some of my friends; they can’t believe what they’re seeing.  And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning.  It’s like military people going into battle, going into war.  The bravery is incredible.  And I just have to take my hat — I would take my hat — if I were wearing a hat, I’d rip that hat off so fast and I would say you people are just incredible.  They really are. They’re very brave.  They’re going in and they don’t know — you have — you have lots of things flying around in the air.  You don’t know what you’re touching.  Is it safe?
And you also see where you have friends that go into the hospital and you say, “How is he doing?” two days later.  And they say, “Sir, he is unconscious” or “He’s in a coma.”  So things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country.
And with all of that being said, the country has come together like I’ve never seen it before.  And we will prevail. We will win.  And hopefully, it will be in a relatively short period of time.
With that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and show you some of the latest — just the data that has been, I think, brilliantly put together.  And, right after that, I’m going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak.  And Mike Pence is going to give you some of the recent events that have taken place and some of the statistics that we have that I think will be very interesting to hear.
Thank you very much.  Please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  If I can have the first slide, please.
(A slide presentation begins.)
So always — and that’s what this slide is labeled, is “Goals of Community Mitigation.”  Really highlighting that this begins in the middle and the end with community.  This community and the community of the American people that are going to have to do the things for the next 30 days to make a difference.
I think you know from that large blue mountain that you can see behind me — and I just want to thank the five or six international and domestic modelers from Harvard, from Columbia, from Northeastern, from Imperial who helped us tremendously.  It was their models that created the ability to see what these mitigations could do, how steeply they could depress the curve from that giant blue mountain down to that more stippled area.
In their estimates, they had between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people in the United States succumbing to this virus without mitigation.  Yet, through their detailed studies and showing us what social distancing would do, what people — what would happen if people stayed home, what would happen if people were careful every day to wash their hands and worry about touching their faces, that what an extraordinary thing this could be if every American followed these.  And it takes us to that stippled mountain that’s much lower — a hill, actually — down to 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, which is still way too much.  Next slide please.
Simultaneously, there was a modeler out of the University of Washington that modeled from cases up, utilizing the experience around the globe to really understand how this information that we have from Italy and Spain and South Korea and China could really help us give insight into the hospital needs, the ventilator needs, and really the number of people who potentially could succumb to this illness.  It is this model that we are looking at now that provides us the most detail of the time course that is possible.  But this model assumes full mitigation.
It’s informed every morning or every night by the reality on the ground coming in from New York, New Jersey, and around the United States, and is modeled and informed every morning so that it is adjusted so it is up to date every day.  This is the model of the predicted fatalities and mortality in the United States.  And as the President said, it’s very much focused on the next two weeks and the stark reality of what this virus will do as it moves through communities.
Next slide, please.
But this is a slide that gives us great hope and understanding about what is possible.  On the bottom of the slide, where you can barely see that blue line at the very bottom, that’s the current cases in California, the cumulative cases in California, where they’re doing significant testing.
The next line up is Connecticut.  The orange line is New Jersey.  The blue line is New York.  The yellow line is Washington.  We all remember Washington State.  It was just a month ago when they started to have the issues in Washington State, but they brought together their communities and their health providers, and they put in strong mitigation methods and testing.  And you can see what the result in Washington State and California is.  But without the continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change.
Next slide, please.
So I’m sure you’re interested in seeing all of the states.  So on this slide is all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  But I think it shows in stark reality the difference between New York and New Jersey and other states with similar populations in urban areas.
Our goal, over the next 30 days, is to ensure the states that you see — the 48 across the bottom — maintain this lower level of new cases with the hope that we don’t have significant outbreaks in other states, in other metro areas, as the community comes together to work together and ensure that the healthcare providers around the globe and in the United States are strengthened by our resolve to continue to mitigate community by community.
This is done community by community.  We all know people are in their states and in their communities.  And we’re very dependent on each person in the United States doing the same thing: following the presidential guidelines to a tee.  I know it’s a lot to ask because you’ve done it for 15 days.
So if you can show the next slide, please.
So this is what gives us a lot of hope.  This is the case finding in Italy.  And you can see that they’re beginning to turn the corner in new cases.  They’re entering their fourth week of full mitigation and showing what is possible when we work together as a community, as a country, to change the course of this pandemic together.  It is this graphic and the graphic of many of the states that gives us hope of what is possible with continuing for another 30 days.
Amidst all that hope, I must say that like we warned about Detroit and Chicago, we start to see changes in Massachusetts.  New Orleans continues to be a problem of new cases, although they’re stabilizing.  And I think it really shows the depth of dedication of the American people to the healthcare providers, because they can see the strain that this puts on every nurse, doctor, respiratory therapist, pharmacists, and laboratory technician.  It’s working together to stem this tide of unrelenting sick people coming to their doors.  No one has been turned away.  No one who has needed ventilation has not received ventilation.  But you can see how stressful it is for each of them.
So I know it’s stressful to follow the guidelines, but it is more stressful and more difficult to the soldiers on the front line.
As we started and — we will end with it’s communities that will do this.  There’s no magic bullet.  There’s no magic vaccine or therapy.  It’s just behaviors.  Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Deborah.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Dr. Birx, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  So what Dr. Birx has really said very simply is that there are really two dynamic forces that are opposing each other here.  As I mentioned several times in our briefings, the virus, if left to its own devices, will do that dark curve that Dr. Birx showed you.  The other dynamic force is what we are doing, what we’re trying to do, and what we will do in the form of mitigation.
Now, these are very revealing bits of data because you saw what happened in Italy where you make the turn around the curve and you go.  That doesn’t happen all at once.  It’s a stepwise fashion.  And if I explain the steps, which I will, you’ll see why we are really convinced that mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us.  Because what you have is you have an increase in new cases at a certain rate.  When the increase in new cases begin to level off, the secondary effect is less hospitalizations, the next effect is less intensive care, and the next effect is less deaths.
The deaths and the intensive care and the hospitalization always lag behind that early indication that there are less new cases per day — the way we saw in Italy and the way we’re likely seeing — I don’t want to jump the gun on it — we’re seeing little inklings of this right now in New York.
So what we’re going to see, and that’s — we got to brace ourselves in the next several days to a week or so — we’re going to continue to see things go up.  We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work.
The slide that Dr. Birx showed, where you saw New York and New Jersey and then the cluster of other areas, our goal, which I believe we can accomplish, is to get to hotspot places — the New Yorks, the New Jersey — and help them to get around that curve, but as importantly, to prevent those clusters of areas that have not yet gone to that spike, to prevent them from getting that spike.  And the answer to that is mitigation.
Now, the 15 days that we had of mitigation clearly have had an effect, although it’s tough to quantitate it because of those two opposing forces.  But the reason why we feel so strongly about the necessity of the additional 30 days is that now is the time, whenever you’re having an effect, not to take your foot off the accelerator and on the brake but to just press it down on the accelerator.  And that’s what I hope and I know that we can do over the next 30 days.
And as I said the other day and on one of the — one of the interviews, we are a very strong and resilient nation.  If you look at our history, we’ve been through some terrible ordeals.  This is tough.  People are suffering.  People are dying.  It’s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this, but this is going to be the answer to our problems.  So let’s all pull together and make sure, as we look forward to the next 30 days, we do it with all the intensity and force that we can.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, I know I speak on behalf of the President and people all across this country when I express our great admiration and appreciation to both of you for helping to steer our nation through this challenging time.
The American people have now seen what the President saw when he made the decision at the end of “15 Days to Slow the Spread” to ask the American people to give us 30 more days to continue to put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America.  And as you just heard from the experts, we have reason to believe that it’s working.
As Dr. Fauci just said, there are difficult days ahead.  Our hearts and our prayers go out to the families that have lost loved ones and those, as the President has just reflected, who we know are struggling at this hour in hospitals across the nation.
But to each and every one of us, do not be discouraged because what you can do to protect your health, the health of your family; what you can do to ensure that our healthcare providers have the resources and our hospitals have the capacity to meet this moment is put into practice: the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America.
It really is what every American can do: “30 Days to Slow the Spread,” 30 days to make a difference in the lives of the American people, American families, and the life of our nation.
Allow me to give you a few brief updates before the President takes questions.
First and foremost, we continue to work very closely with governors around the nation.  The President and I spoke to all the governors, all the states and territories yesterday.  And since we were last together, the President and I have spoken directly to several governors around the country, including Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and other states.
At the present moment, the President has declared 29 major disaster declarations and authorized 10 different states to use full federal funding, so-called Title 32 funding, to pay for their National Guard.
And, as of this afternoon, FEMA reports some 17,000 National Guard has been activated in states around the country to provide support for coronavirus response.
On the subject of testing, we have now completed more than 1.1 million tests around the country.  We’re working very closely with governors around America to — to assist them in drive-through and community testing centers.
I spoke with Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois today about a testing center that they’ve established in cooperation with the U.S. Public Health Service.
We remind every governor and every laboratory and hospital in the country it’s imperative that you continue to report daily to the CDC the results of those tests to give us the visibility on the data to best inform resource decisions.
Also, we — we reiterated today to governors in person, and also through correspondence to every governor, the importance of using their National Guard, if need be, to move medical supplies.  FEMA is very busy, as you’ll hear in a moment, delivering literally millions of supplies to states around the country.  But we’re urging every governor to make sure to work with their state emergency management team and maybe use the National Guard to move those supplies from warehouses to hospitals.
At the present moment, as the President said, we’ve distributed more than 11.6 million N95 masks, more than 8,100 ventilators around the nation, millions of face shields, surgical masks, and gloves.
We initiated an air bridge that the President announced yesterday.  Flights have arrived in New York, one arrived in Illinois yesterday, and a flight will arrive in Ohio in the next 24 hours.
FEMA is literally working and contracting around the world with now more than 51 flights that will be bringing vital medical supplies.
On the subject of ventilators, FEMA is currently delivering 400 ventilators to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Louisiana, 50 ventilators to Connecticut, and in the last week and in the week ahead, more than 450 ventilators to Illinois.  This is in addition to more than 4,400 ventilators that the President and FEMA directed to the state of New York.
We just want people that are working on the frontlines, that the President just spoke about, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci spoke about — we want you to know help is on the way.  And, at the President’s direction, we’re going to leave no stone unturned anywhere in America or anywhere in the world to make sure that you have the resources and the equipment to do your job.
So again, I want to just say, “Thank you, America.”  Thank you for stepping up.  Thank you for putting into practice the “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  And thank you for the response that tens of millions have already had for the “30 Days to Slow the Spread.”
We encourage each one of you, as we have governors around the country, to spread the word about the guidelines, listen to your state and local authorities in areas that are more greatly impacted.  We continue to urge people in the areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from travel around the country.  And people who’ve traveled from that area, check your temperature and self-quarantine for 14 days.
You can see from that chart the unique challenges people in the Greater New York City area are facing with the coronavirus.  And we want to do all that we can to protect your health, focus resources on the community, and prevent unnecessary spread.
Lastly, as the President highlighted yesterday, businesses around America are stepping up as never before.  Tomorrow, I’ll travel with Secretary Sonny Perdue to Gordonsville, Virginia, to the Walmart distribution center, just so the American people can see firsthand how the food supply is continuing to roll on 18 wheels and through air freight all over America.
And we thank again the grocery store operators around America and everybody that’s working out on the highways and byways every day to keep that food supply rolling, and rolling strong.
To the American people though, we just want to assure you that we’re going to continue to work our hearts out — work our hearts out to make sure our healthcare providers have everything they need, that anyone struggling with coronavirus has the support and healthcare they need.
And I’m absolutely confident, seeing the way our governors are responding and seeing this team the President has assembled in the White House Coronavirus Task Force, confident of the prayers of the American people that we’ll get through this.  But it will take all of us doing our part, and we’ll get through it together.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-15/

1080,Trump,2020-03-30 12:12:00+00:00,Remarks by President Trump and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force in a Press Briefing,Nan,"Rose Garden
5:12 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Very comfortable here.  A lot of room.  And we appreciate you being here.
Yesterday I announced that we would be extending our social distance guidelines through the end of April.  This is based on modeling that shows the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks.  The same modeling also shows that, by very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives.  Think of that: 1 million American lives.
Our future is in our own hands, and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and, really, the fate of our victory.  We will have a great victory.  We have no other choice.  Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war.  Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus.  This is our shared patriotic duty.
Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days.  We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days.  So important because we have to get back.  But the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis.  And that’s the time we’re waiting for.  The more we commit ourselves now, the sooner we can win the fight and return to our lives.  And they will be great lives — maybe better than ever.
Today we reached a historic milestone in our war against the coronavirus.  Over 1 million Americans have now been tested — more than any other country, by far; not even close — and tested accurately.
And I think what I’d like to do is ask Secretary Azar, who’s done a fantastic job, to come up and just say a few words about the fact that we reached substantially now more than 1 million tests.
Please.  Thank you, Alex.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in marshaling all the resources that we have for this unprecedented testing effort.  And thank you, Mr. Vice President, for leading a whole-of-economy approach to testing.
As the President mentioned, today the United States hit more than 1 million samples tested — a number that no other country has reached.  We’re now testing nearly 100,000 samples a day, also a level that no other country has reached.
I want to thank every partner that has been involved in this effort.  That includes all of the men and women of the FDA and the CDC, including Director Redfield and Commissioner Hahn.  Together, the FDA and CDC have worked to balance the need for testing on an aggressive scale with the scientific rigor that Americans expect.
Working with our testing coordinator, Admiral Giroir, they have now truly unleashed the ingenuity of the private sector and our state and local leaders, the centerpieces of America’s historic approach to testing.
I want to thank those state and local leaders who have used their on-the-ground resources and knowledge to lead testing and make it much more easily accessible to the Americans who need it.  I’m also grateful to FEMA, with whom we are now working closely to get state and local partners what they need.
I also want to thank CMS, where Administrator Verma has given healthcare providers unprecedented flexibility to scale up capacity for testing and treatment, and has ensured that tests will be paid for.
Finally, we would not be where we are today without the many American companies, entrepreneurs, and scientists who have worked day and night to develop, as of today, 20 different emergency testing options.  With the FDA responding to request for authorization typically within 24 hours, the number of options is growing nearly every day.  FDA has also opened up new options for using the available tests, like self-swabbing and new options for reagents.
I also want to thank FDA and other components of HHS for incredibly rapid action on other tools that we need.  This weekend, we actually worked to secure 30 million tablets from Sandoz and 1 million tablets from Bayer of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which are potential COVID-19 treatments.  And we authorized Battelle’s new decontamination machines, which can each sterilize thousands of essential N95 masks for reuse every day.
So thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and thank you to everybody who’s played a part in getting us where we are today.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to come up — FDA — because we have some really good stuff.  First of all, the numbers have been incredible on testing, but in the days ahead, we’re going to go even faster.  And we have something from Abbott Labs, which is right here, and that’s a five-minute test, highly accurate.
And I maybe can show that as we listen to our FDA Commissioner — the job he’s done in the approval process.  We talked about the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine just now.  I thought that I’d mention it, but Alex has already done that, but we have that now under test with 1,100 people in New York.  And it was only the fast approval by FDA that allowed us to do that.  It was a really rapid approval.
And, Doctor, please say a few words.  And this is the first one on the line of the five-minute test from Abbott.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for your leadership of the task force.  I’m very proud of FDA staff’s work in the last few months to expedite the availability of testing in this country.  I’m also incredibly appreciative of private industries’ ingenuity and willingness to work with us quickly to develop and distribute those tests.
We’ve had a substantial addition to testing with the authorization of point-of-care tests, especially the Abbott point-of-care test, which the President has pulled out of the box.
A point-of-care test is a test that gives you a result where you’re getting care.  This is truly a patient-centered approach — whether it’s the doctor’s office, a hospital, an emergency room, an urgent care center, or a drive-by testing site.
Just like tests for flu or strep, where go to the doctor’s and you can get the test done, you can get an answer within minutes of having this test done.  Now, with those tests being approved for Abbott and for others, these are available around the country.  They’re planning to scale up the number of tests that can be put out throughout the country over the next month.  And patients can get the answer within as little as 15 to 5 minutes.  And then, of course, an appropriate plan of treatment can be given.
We at FDA are working quickly with Abbott, as well, and other testing approaches.  And normally these tests take months to develop.  I was on the phone today with the Abbott CEO.  He told me that normally this is a 9- to 12-month approach to developing a point-of-care test.  They did this in collaboration with FDA and U.S. government within weeks.
Abbott has shared that they will be delivering these tests tomorrow and then will be ramping up.  I’d just like to emphasize one thing: The most innovative and safe products come from the private sector in partnership with government, taking an all-hands-on-deck approach, just like in this case.  And the other point here is that Abbott and FDA worked together to make sure that we had a fast, reliable, and accurate test to market.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor.  Great job too.  Really great job.  Thank you, Steve.
So, the pharmaceutical company, Sandoz, has been working with us very closely.  And as Alex mentioned a little bit, 30 million doses of the hydroxychloroquine to the United States government has been given.  And Bayer has donated 1 million doses of the chloroquine, which will soon be distributed to states and state health officials around the country.  Teva Pharmaceuticals is also donating 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to U.S. hospitals.  That’s 6 million doses.
So the private sector, as you’d say, Steve, has been amazing, what’s happened.  Really amazing.  And we’re going to introduce you to some of the greatest business executives in the world today, no matter where you go, and they’re going to say a little bit about what they’re doing.  And then we have so many more.
The FDA has also authorized the — Battelle’s N95 respirator mask sterilization kits.  It’s an incredible thing.  I’ve been asking, “Why are we throwing these masks away?”  You look at some of these masks and they’re significant pieces of equipment.  And I say, “How come you throw them away?  Why aren’t they using sterilization techniques?”
And I got a call from Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio — and he’s a tremendous guy, a tremendous governor — and he said, “We have a company named Battelle, and they’re having a hard time getting approval from the FDA.”  And I called up Dr. Hahn, and within a very short period of time, they got the approval.  Steve, we really appreciate it.  I want to thank Mike and I want to thank Steve.
And they’re going to be able — each machine now can disinfect 120,000 masks per day.  Now, think of that.  Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day.  It’ll be just like a new one.  It can go up to about 20 times for each mask.  So each mask can go through this process 20 times.  And they have two in Ohio, one in New York, and one will soon be shipped to Seattle, Washington, and also to Washington, D.C.  So that’s going to make a tremendous difference on the masks.
This morning, I spoke to our nation’s governors to help each state get the medical supplies they need.  And yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence asked our nation’s hospitals to begin reporting total bed capacity, ICU bed capacity, ventilator capacity, and vital medical supply levels on a daily basis.  And, Mike, thank you for the great job.  Thank you very much.
In New York, the 2,900-bed hospital under construction, which is now completed — they completed it in three days; you might say three and a half days — at the Javits Center will be completed today.  Will be — and when you look — so they’re going up.  I think we’re going to be adding some more beds, which will be completed today.
And we’ve opened up — whoops, there goes our box.  And my hair is blowing around, and it’s mine.  (Laughter.)  The one thing you can’t get away with.  If it’s not yours, you got a problem, if you’re President.
And nearly 3,000 medical beds will become operational.  The U.S. Navy ship Comfort also arrived today, equipped with 12 operating rooms and 1,000 hospital beds.  Work has begun on additional temporary hospital sites, including a 600-bed capacity nursing home facility in Brooklyn, and numerous floors of a high-rise building on Wall Street.
So it’s been really pretty amazing what they’ve done, and the Army Corps of Engineers, what they’ve done.  They’ve done — they just completed — think of it — a 2,900-bed hospital in New York in just about three days, maybe four days.  And the whole city is talking about it.
On top of that, we floated in a great ship, which is going to be 1,000 rooms, which is being used for patients outside of what we’re focused on.  And that will free up a lot of rooms for what we’re focused on.  So, it’s been great.
The Army Corps of Engineers has awarded contracts for the construction of alternate care facilities, also, at the State University at Stony Brook, State University Old Westbury, and the Westchester Community Center.  We’re sending 60 ambulances to New York City today.  We have a total of 60.  We’re getting some additional ones, with up to 190 more to follow at different locations.
To date, FEMA has obligated more than 1.3 million dollars — billion dollars in federal support to the State of New York.  So we’re spending a lot of money in New York.  It’s a hot — it’s a hotbed.  There’s no question about it.  And we’re spending a lot of time, effort on New York, New Jersey.  Spoke with Governor Cuomo a lot.  Spoke with Governor Murphy a lot, in New Jersey.  And we’re — we’re really getting the job done.  People are very impressed, and I’m very impressed by the people in FEMA, the people in the Army Corps of Engineers because what they’ve done, I’ve never seen anybody do anything like it.
In addition to the 8,100 ventilators that we’ve already delivered over the next 48 hours, we’re delivering more than 1,000.  We’re going — 400 ventilators are going to Michigan very shortly, 300 going to New Jersey, 150 ventilators to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana, and 50 to Connecticut.
FEMA and HHS already delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns, and 22 million gloves.
And I don’t know if you just saw it.  It just came over the wires that Ford just announced, just a little while ago, that they will produce, along with General Electric Healthcare, 50,000 ventilators, and they’re going to be doing it in less than 100 days.
On top of that, we have other companies that are doing ventilators, including General Motors.  But we have nine other companies doing ventilators.  As we outpace what we need, we’re going to be sending them to Italy.  We’re going to be sending them to France.  We’re going to be sending them to Spain, where they have tremendous problems, and other countries as we — as we can.  But the fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies.
More than 14,000 National Guard members have been activated and can help supplement state and local efforts to distribute personal protective equipment, where we’re sending a lot.  We have planeloads coming in.  We have 51 loads from various locations all around the world, and they’re landing.  We had our first big cargo plane land this morning, and we’re getting it from all over the world.
And we’re also sending things that we don’t need to other parts.  I just spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy, and we have additional capacity.  We have additional product that we don’t need.  We’re going to be sending approximately 100 million dollars’ worth of things — of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy.  And Giuseppe was very, very happy — I will tell you that.  They’re having a very hard time.
Joining us this afternoon are CEOs of the great American companies that are fulfilling their patriotic duty by producing or donating medical equipment to help meet our most urgent needs.  What they’re doing is incredible.  And these are great companies.
Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell — you know that.  And Darius has been somebody that I’ve dealt with in the past, and he’s a great leader of a great company.
Debra Waller of Jockey International.
A friend of mine, Mike Lindell of MyPillow.  Boy, do you sell those pillows.  That’s unbelievable what you do.
David Taylor of Procter & Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies Corporation.
And I just want to tell all of you that America is very grateful to you and what you’ve done.  An amazing job you’ve done, and we thank you very much.
I’d like you to come up and say a couple of words, if you might, about your companies.  Mike, come on up.  Come on up, fellas, please.  Come on up.  You have to say what you’re doing because it’s been really incredible.
Go ahead, Mike.
MR. LINDELL:  Okay, well, MyPillow is a U.S. vertically integrated company, which has been forced to adjust to the changing business environment as a result of the pandemic.  MyPillow’s unique position as a U.S. company functions as a manufacturer, logistics management distributor, and direct-to-consumer.  Given our current business lines, we are experiencing the effects of this pandemic firsthand.
What MyPillow has done — we’ve established an internal task force, which is monitoring future needs of companies across the country as a result of this pandemic.  And given our position, we’ve begun to research and develop new protocols to address the current and future needs of U.S. businesses across multiple sectors, how companies are going to prepare themselves when they once again open up, and changes to their current operations in order to adjust to future threats and pandemics.
MyPillow has designated some of its call centers to help U.S. companies navigate the many issues that resulted from this pandemic.  We’ve dedicated 75 percent of my manufacturing to produce cotton facemasks.  In three days, I was up to 10,000 a day.  By Friday, I want to be up to 50,000 a day.
I proud to manufacture our products in the United States, and I’m even more proud to be able to serve our nation in this great time of need.  Thank you, Mr. President, for your call to action when — which has empowered companies like MyPillow to help our nation win this invisible war.
Now, I wrote something off the cuff, if I can read this.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.
MR. LINDELL:  (Laughs.)  God gave us grace on November 8th, 2016, to change the course we were on.  God had been taken out of our schools and lives.  A nation had turned its back on God.  And I encourage you: Use this time at home to get — home to get back in the Word, read our Bibles, and spend time with our families.
Our President gave us so much hope where, just a few short months ago, we had the best economy, the lowest unemployment, and wages going up.  It was amazing.  With our great President, Vice President, and this administration and all the great people in this country praying daily, we will get through this and get back to a place that’s stronger and safer than ever.
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s very nice.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike.  Appreciate it.
Please come on up.  I did not know he was going to do that, but he’s a friend of mine, and I do appreciate it.  Thank you, Mike, very much.
Please.
MR. ADAMCZYK:  First of all, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, the entire administration, and all the agencies, thank you for your strong leadership during this time of crisis.  It is noticed and it’s making a difference.
Second of all, I’d like to say a big thank you to all the healthcare workers out there.  You’re putting yourself in harm’s way every day, and we really respect what you’re doing, and we couldn’t be thankful enough for it.  And I can tell you that more help is on the way.
We, as Honeywell, we’re an industrial technology company.  And one of the businesses that we’re in: We protect the industrial worker.  But what we’re doing today is we’re repurposing a lot of that equipment to serve the healthcare worker.
A few days ago, we announced the start-up of a new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island.  We’re going to be hiring 500 employees.  We have already 200 onboard.  And we’re going to be starting the production of N95 masks within the next two weeks.
Furthermore, today we’re announcing the start-up of another manufacturing facility in Arizona.  We’re going to be hiring another 500 people.  And we’re going to be starting up production in that facility by the middle of May.  So, in total, we’ve doubled our production of N95 masks already.  It’s going to double again within the next 60 days.  And then within the next 90 days, we’re going to have 5x the capacity we do today.
Furthermore, we’re going to be providing other safety equipment to support all the efforts going out.
Lastly, I’ll say a big thank you to all the Honeywell employees, and also announce a $10 million fund for them, for all the hourly and administrative employees who are having a hard time during this time of crisis.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Fantastic.  Thank you.  Normally, I’d shake his hand, but we’re not supposed to do that anymore.  So, that’s okay.  Great job.  Thank you to Honeywell.
Please, go ahead.  Debra, please.
MS. WALLER:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr.  Vice President, on your guidance during this unprecedented time.  And I’m very honored to be here today.  Founded by a minister 144 years ago, Jockey International is a family-owned company headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Since 1876, we have been providing socks and underwear for generations of families.
It is part of our DNA to roll up our sleeves and help our country in her time of need.  During World War Two, we made parachutes for the military.  And today, we are eager to serve this great country by providing support for the healthcare workers on the frontlines of this fight.  As the President and Vice President have said, it’s a whole-of-America approach and we are committed.
Jockey has had a longstanding partnership with Encompass Group, headquartered in Georgia, serving the healthcare community.  When we learned of the critical need for PPE, we knew we had to help.  That meant restarting production on tier three isolation gowns.  Monumental lifting by Jockey, Encompass, FEMA, and the FDA was done in just a few days to be production ready.  As a result, we expect to begin delivering 30- to 50,000 gowns per week, helping those that need it the most right now.
In addition, this week we are also donating 10,000 units of scrubs to the frontline doctors and nurses at the Javits Convention Center in New York City.  We would not have been able to do this without the collaboration of the administration, representatives from the federal agencies, and Congressman Bryan Steil.
Thank you very much, Mr. President and Mr. Vice — Mr. Vice President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MS. WALLER:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.  Thank you very much.
MR. TAYLOR:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for bringing us together today.  I’m proud to be able to represent the men and women of Procter & Gamble, who every day, 24 hours a day, are working to build and make essential cleaning products, hygiene products, and healthcare products for families everywhere.  These include healthcare workers and for institutions that are serving those on the frontline.
P&G people are the faces of brands you know and trust — brands like Tide, Pampers, Bounty, Charmin, Mr. Clean, and Vicks.  In addition to making, packing, and shipping these essential items, they’ve worked together to transform our plants to make things we’ve never made before, like hand sanitizers and facial masks.  Some of these are already getting to national, state, and local agencies.  Some of them are in the hospitals already.
Everywhere around the world, PNG people are working every day to serve everybody — consumers.  And they’re working together to bring together the full capability of our research and development, our engineering, our manufacturing, and our communications capability to make sure we make a difference to the consumers we serve and to all the audience that we can make a difference to.  I want to thank them and I’m very grateful for what they do every day in service to others.
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Please.
MR. HAYES:  Mr. President.  Good afternoon.  I’m Greg Hayes from United Technologies, and on behalf of the 240,000 employees of United Technologies and the 70,000 employees at Raytheon, which will join together with UTC this Friday, I want to first of all say thank you to the President and the Vice President for your leadership during what is really a war.  It is a different war than anybody has ever fought before, but it’s a war that we’re uniquely qualified to help.
As one of the world’s largest defense contractors and some of the best technology, we’re using that technology to try and solve some real-world problems.  Today, we’re working with the Air Force to try and help pilots as they’re moving medical evacuees with the COVID-19 virus, such that they can be protected and that the patients can be protected.
Again, we’re working also with logistics.  And if you think about a war, strategy is important, but logistics wins war.  It’s — it’s imperative, I think, with FEMA, along with the Mr. Navarro’s office, that we coordinate all of these activities.  Last week, we donated about 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA.  Next week, we’ll have another almost million.  Again, working through our supply chain partners around the world.
We’re also today — this week, beginning the manufacture of face shields.  Using the additive technologies that we have and the machines that we have available within UTC, we’ll be able to produce approximately 10,000 shields in the next four weeks — again, all needed equipment.  We stand ready to help in any way we can.  We don’t need the Defense Production Act to ask us to act.  All of the people at UTC and Raytheon are focused on this war and winning it.
Again, I also want to say thank you to all of our employees for their work during this crisis, as well as to the frontline medical and other first responders.  Thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  Great company.  Those are great companies.  Thank you very much.
I’d like to ask Seema to come up and say a few words about what you’re doing and what’s happening and how positive it’s been.  I really appreciate it.  Come on up, Seema Verma.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And let me start by saying, I want to convey my deepest sympathies to those that have lost loved ones to the coronavirus.  We’re all thinking of you.
Today is Doctors’ Day and, even without it, I want to send a message of gratitude to the foot soldiers in this war: men and women that are providing care and comfort to Americans that have been affected by the virus.  Your country is grateful.
And, in short, as the President has said, we are engaged in a war against an invisible enemy.  In wartime, the assumptions of peacetime must be revisited and adjusted to meet the demands of the moment.  And so, under the President’s leadership, CMS is waiving a wide and unprecedented range of regulatory requirements.  Now, many healthcare systems won’t need these waivers and they shouldn’t use them if they don’t need them, but the flexibilities are there.
In a time of crisis, regulations shouldn’t stand in the way of patient care.  And there are several components to our announcement today, but the first one is CMS’s Hospitals Without Walls, and this is going to allow hospital systems to create new treatment sites outside of their facility to expand capacity and be able to safely separate patients that are infected with the coronavirus and those that are not.
Now, FEMA is doing incredible work, setting up temporary hospitals in New York and other areas.  But under these waivers, we are empowering local communities to complement and augment the work of FEMA and allowing hospital systems to tap into the capacity that already exists in their communities, making use of dorms and hotels or gymnasiums, and allowing the main hospital to focus on those that need the most intensive care.  There are surgery centers out there today that are delaying elective surgeries and they may have excess capacity that can be devoted to hospital-like care.
We’re also making changes to the Medicare program to facilitate testing.  So some people that need a coronavirus test can’t leave their home or patients that are in a nursing home, and now we will pay for labs to go out to these locations and perform testing.
And we’re also expanding the workforce.  We are taking action today to relax some of our regulations to allow hospitals to increase their workforce.  And we’re allowing a broad range of flexibilities so that we can let healthcare workers operate at the top of their license.
And we are also allowing our hospitals to give — to provide more support for our healthcare workers.  Under today’s regulations, they can only provide minimal support to healthcare workers, but now we’re going to allow them to provide child care, meals, laundry services.
And then there’s also telehealth.  The President already directed a dramatic expansion of telehealth to our nation’s 62 million seniors with Medicare.  And we’re so proud of all the healthcare — healthcare providers and patients that have rapidly implemented telehealth.
But today, we’re announcing that we’re going to go even further and we’re going to be paying for doctors to make phone calls with their patients and provide care over the phone.  And we’re getting rid of longstanding barriers to telehealth in the Medicare program, allowing emergency rooms to use telehealth and eliminating requirements that some visits be provided face to face.
And I also want to mention that, on Saturday, the President directed CMS to offer advance payments for healthcare providers that are experiencing cash-flow problems.  We know that many providers are complying with our recommendations to delay nonessential elective surgeries, and they shouldn’t be penalized for doing the right thing.
Now, I’ve barely scratched the surface of all the flexibilities that we are offering healthcare workers and healthcare systems.  These flexibilities will provide a lot of flexibility from regulations that are ill suited to the unprecedented needs of this emergency.  And doctors and nurses and other healthcare professionals that are working long hours and sacrificing times with their families and risking their lives will have the flexibility that they need to confront the needs of the coronavirus pandemic.
And there are many heroes in this war, but I want to take an opportunity to thank the team at CMS.  These folks have worked day and night.  The flexibilities that are in this regulation — in any regulation — usually take CMS a year, but we did this in two weeks, and I couldn’t be more honored and privileged to serve alongside these dedicated public servants.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Seema.  Fantastic job.  And you’re doing a great job.
So, we are in the midst of something that is very difficult, but we are going to win; it’s just a question of when.  We want to do it as quickly as possible.  We want to have as few deaths as possible.
And we will meet again tomorrow for some statistics, and some updates as to where we are, where we think we’re going, and timing.  I think timing is going to be very important because we have to get our country back.  We have to get our country back to where it was and maybe beyond where it was because we’ve learned so much.
But we will have lost a lot of people.  And in many ways, they’re heroes.  And if you look at what’s happening with our medical professionals, it’s a danger.  They’re — they’re warriors.  Men and women are doing a job that — the likes of which I don’t think anyone’s ever seen.  I see them coming out of planes today, going into New York, going into the most dangerous locations, dangerous areas.  And they go in there and they just want to do the job.  And you see the numbers.  You see the numbers like I see the numbers.
I have some friends that are unbelievably sick.  We thought they were going in for a mild stay.  And, in one case, he’s unconscious — in a coma.  And you say, “How did that happen?”
So I just want to thank all of the great professionals: men and women — doctors and nurses and paramedics and first responders and law enforcement.  By the way, if you look at New York and you see how — the effect that this had on law enforcement, it’s been incredible.  These are great people — firefighters.  Great people.  They’re helping in so many different ways.
So, thank you very much.  And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions.  John, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

March 29, 2020
5:43 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate everybody being here.  Beautiful day in the Rose Garden.  Tremendous distance between chairs.  Social distancing.  You practice it very well.  We appreciate it.  That’s great.
I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus.
On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightning-fast results in as little as five minutes.  That’s a whole new ballgame.  I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they’ve done.  They’ve been working around the clock.  Normally, this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months, and even longer, but we did it in four weeks.  Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week.
And as you know, even before this development, we’ve been doing more test — tests than any other country anywhere in the world.  It’s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we’ve been testing.  It’s also one of the reasons that we’re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we’ve been doing more testing.  So we have bigger numbers to look at.
I want to also thank General Semonite, of the Army Corps of Engineers, and General Polowczyk, who’s here with us, who’s going to say a few words in a little while.  What the Army Corps of Engineers did, along with FEMA, in New York was incredible.  They built 2,900 beds’ worth of hospital.  An incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well.  And I just want to say that was unreal.  They did it in less than four days.  People have never seen anything like that.  And it’s an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital.  They did it so quickly.  Everyone is trying to figure out how they did it, including me — and I was a good builder.  But they did it very quickly, Mike.  So we’re very — we’re very happy.
So I want to thank Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA — the incredible job they have done.
Now they’re moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals.  We’re doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey — many, many other places.  But these are incredible men and women, and they worked around the clock.
And the people of New York are very happy.  Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate.  But these are — I mean, there’s nobody could have done a job like that.  Most people have never seen anything like it.
The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contain, and ultimately defeat the virus.  We will defeat the virus.  It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus — so important — in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes.  And we will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers and making.
I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients — people in New York — along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin.  And it’s very early yet; it’s only — it started two days ago.  But we will see what happens.
I want to thank Stephen Hahn, who’s a great doctor — left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible Hospital in Texas.  And he’s the head of the FDA.  And Stephen got approval for that so fast.  Let’s see how it works.  It may, it may not.  But we may have some incredible results.  We’re going to know soon.  So it’s tested — it’s being tested on 1,100 people in New York.
The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients.  This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus.  So they’ve recovered; they’re strong.  Something was good in them that worked.  And so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well — meaning, their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus — and transfusing it into six [six] patients — sick patients, very — very, very powerfully.
So, sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system.  We’ll see what happens.  And we’re having some early results that are good, but we will see.  And that’s going, I think, very rapidly.  Again, we got approvals in, really, very quick time.
We’re also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks.  I kept saying to myself — I’d see some of the masks are very complex.  We’re delivering millions, by the way.  Millions.  But I kept saying, “Why aren’t they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?”
And Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, called me.  They have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks, and in some cases, depending on the mask — some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material — they’re able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times.  So that’s, I guess, like getting 20 masks.  And so we worked on that.  As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved, and the FDA is now involved.  And we’re trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks.  That would be a tremendous difference.  That would be really helpful.
While much of the research has to be done — we have a lot of research left to do, obviously — this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries.  We’re in communication with other countries, and very strong communications.  And they’re very reliant on us in just about all cases.  We have the greatest people in the world.  They’re very, very anxious to find out how we’re doing on our different things, whether it’s a cure or whether it’s really anything having to do with getting people better.  We have some interesting things will be announced, I think over the next few weeks, but we’ll see what happens.  They’re being tested right now.
The vaccines are moving along very rapidly.  The vaccines are an answer, but I’d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick.  And we’re working on that at a level that people would be amazed.  These are incredible people.  They don’t stop.
This method also has been used for more than a century — and that’s the blood-related therapy — you know, more than a century to fight off infectious diseases.  So it’s not unusual.  Our level of complexity has changed, but it’s a concept that’s been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic.  And that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody has seen until what we’re facing now.  That was in 1918.  You know what the result of that was; probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed.
And also, other viruses, like the one in this outbreak — this is a very tough one.  This is a tough one because it spreads so quickly, like nothing we’ve seen.  It spreads so easily, so quickly.
We’re unleashing every tool in our nation’s vast arsenal — economic, medal [sic] — medical.  If you look, medical, and scientific, military.  Homeland Security is working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus.
As you know, every level of government — state, local, and federal — is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers.  We’re delivering vast orders of this material.  I’m going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it.
Joining us today are the leaders of America’s largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, Henry Schein, Owens & Minor, Medline, FedEx, and UPS.  We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed.
And maybe I’d like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Kaufmann to come up, and maybe Ed Pesicka.  Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen & Minor.
But I — and I appreciate.  And if anybody else has anything, please come up.  But if you could come up, Mike, for a second and, Ed, for a second.  Just, if you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting.  Thank you.
MR. KAUFMANN:  Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks for your leadership on this.  Because of that leadership, we have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before.  We have seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people.
And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of our customers because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day.  And we need to do everything we can to make things good for them.  And so it’s been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR. KAUFMANN:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Appreciate it.   Please.
MR.PESICKA:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support you have provided to the industry.  And one of the things we did — we did hear the challenge.  And starting in January, we’ve ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina, where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the U.S. healthcare system.
And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting: One of the issues we’re struggling with is the demand increase.  You know, used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly ten- to twenty thousand masks a week are now using two- to three hundred thousand masks a week.  So you multiply that times the entire pop- — the entire U.S., let alone the same demand outside of the U.S.  That’s part of the issue we’re running into: Is even with a significant ramp-up in supply, you know, there’s still that demand that is — that is much greater than that supply.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
MR.PESICKA:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  And I bring that up because when we discussed, back in a room — we were in a conference room — a very nice one, actually; it’s called the Cabinet Room — that statement was made that they’ve been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks.  Okay, it’s a New York hospital.  Very — it’s packed all the time.  How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000?  10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000?
Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters.  Where are the masks going?  Are they going out the back door?  How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000?  And we have that in a lot of different places.  So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don’t see, from a practical standpoint, how that’s possible to go from that to that.  And we have that happening in numerous places — not to that extent; that was the highest number I’ve heard.  That’s the highest number you’ve seen, I would imagine, right?
But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals.  He knows the system better than anybody.  And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number.  So thank you very much.  I hope I didn’t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble.  So they have to look at that in New York.
FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States.  The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York, this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment, including 130,000 N95 respirators — those are the ones that we were talking about before — 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves, and many other things.  Millions and millions of different items.
FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily.  We hope to have about 50 flights.  We’re going to have — I think including the one that came in today, we’re up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies.  That was so nice to be here today.  Would you like to say something on behalf?  Please, come up.  Thank you.
MS. LANE:  Thank you, Mr President, for the incredible leadership.  I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort.  Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before, and the way we’re going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort.  We have a Big Brown army — 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver.
We’re bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most.  We’re proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states, we can deliver what is needed everywhere.
So thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job you’re doing.
Please.  Thank you very much.
MR. TYLER:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I would certainly like to echo my colleagues’ comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market and the distributors represented here today has been incredible.  It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks.
Today’s first delivery of Operation Airbridge, I think, is the first evidence that it’s working.  The 51 flights you referenced we’re excited about.  We look to build upon that.  So I would echo my thanks for your leadership, and certainly to the staffs, for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the frontlines providing care.
And maybe just a quick word of thanks, on behalf of all the CEOs here, to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country, in pharmacies across the country, and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going.  The supply chain is working.  It’s resilient.  Supply is a challenge, and we’re tackling that.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great job.  Please.
MR. MILLS:  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.  And thanks to FEMA and HHS.  I think great leadership, and it’s really working well.  The demand has skyrocketed, and we’re doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more — other protective apparel.  We are involved in reprocessing masks, and we’ve already started at about 100,000 masks per day, and we hope to expand from there.  So we’re quite optimistic about it.
THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Yeah.
MR. MILLS:  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.
Anybody else, if you want?  Yes, please.  You’re doing such a great job, we have to —
MR. CONNETT:  Well, thanks.
THE PRESIDENT:  — have everybody if they want.
MR. CONNETT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts.  Number one, we’ve all talked about PPE products; that’s critical.  And it’s not just to the hospitals — that’s a must — but it’s really to all healthcare providers out there working on the frontline.  So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients.  It’s absolutely key.
Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America.  That is critical.  A lesson to be learned from where we are.
And lastly, we’re proud that we introduced a test.  We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form.  We’re excited about that.  We’ve worked with your administration very closely, and the FDA, and we’re very grateful for that because it’s a quick, rapid antibody test that is needed as well.  So we’re really proud to work with your administration.  All going well.  Thanks so much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.
So thank you all very much and for the great job you’re doing.  It’s really incredible, frankly.  Many of the states are stocked up.  Some of them don’t admit it, but they have — we have sent just so much — so many things to them and — including ventilators.
You know, there’s a question as to hoarding of ventilators.  Some hospitals and independent hospitals — and some hospital chains, as we call them — they are holding ventilators; they don’t want to let them up.  We need them for certain areas where there’s big problems.  We can’t hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road.
So we’ve delivered a lot, and this group has been really fantastic.  We want to thank you.  And UPS and FedEx, in particular, you’ve gone absolutely out of your way, so we appreciate everything you’ve done and delivered.
The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives.
Yesterday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk as the USNS Comfort departed from New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy — anywhere, frankly, in the United States.  It was an incredible thing to see.  Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving.  It left literally three weeks early.  It was under maintenance, and they got the maintenance done very quickly.  They work round the clock as many of the people have.  And it was a great sight.
Additionally, two of the country’s largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna, are announcing that they will waive co-pays — which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance;  they don’t waive co-pays too easily, but we’ve asked them to do it and they’ve done it — coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic.  So they’re waiving co -pays, coinsurance, and deductibles.  Nobody has — I don’t think anyone has heard of that one.  Have you heard of that one before?  I haven’t heard.  I want to thank them.  Great companies.
Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck.  Wolfgang Puck is a great restauranteur, as you know, as is Jean-Georges and Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud, and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest-hit industries.  I’ve directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs incentives to stay open.  You’re going to lose all these restaurants and they’re not going to make it back.  They have to get going.
So what I’m doing is I’m going to tell Secretary Mnuchin and also our great Secretary of Labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago.
And we’re going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants.  I think it’ll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open.  I mean, don’t forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not-too-distant future, and we expect that.  But there are some that aren’t going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do.
So we’re going to look at the restoration — restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so that corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days.  That was when restaurants were doing really well.
The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historic relief for American workers and small businesses, and it includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention.  So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that’s a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the worker.  So it’s $350 billion — job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers.  I mean, how about that?
Three hundred billion dollars in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four.  So they’ll be getting a check for $3,400 for the typical family of four.
Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits.  Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.  The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems, not us.  State.
And I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they’re not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly.  They’re not set up for that.  And I didn’t want to do it but our opponents wanted it, so we did it.  And if they don’t get their money fast, I’m going to ask that we convene the federal government — that we come back to Congress and we’ll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly — and I said that.
But a lot of these systems, they’re so old and so antiquated at the state level that they’re going to — they have the money, and they’re going to get the money very quickly, but they’re not going to be able to distribute it.  So remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money.
Throughout this great national struggle, the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge — every single one in our nation’s history.  More than 90 percent of Americans say they’re staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens and to their country.  Social distancing: That’s the way you win.
These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before.  Family bonds are strengthening.  Neighbors are looking after neighbors.  It’s incredible.  I’m seeing, you’re seeing, everybody is seeing what’s happening.  Communities are rallying for the cause, and all divisions are fading away.
The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need.  It’s up to 151 countries.  So when we say “our nation” — our nation and the world, when you think.  Think of it: 151 countries.  Somebody said to me today that wasn’t in this particular world — they didn’t know that we had that many countries.  A hundred and fifty-one countries.  That’s something.
And some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible.  If you look at Italy, if you look at — France is having big problems.  Spain is having incredible problems.  Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do, a great thing to do.  We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths.  And we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level.  But those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that.
The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare ex- — I mean, we have — and these people are amazing — the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world.  They demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and, ultimately, the number of fatalities.
I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives.  You’re making the difference.  The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks.  So, I’ll say it again: The peak, the highest point of death rates — remember this — is likely to hit in two weeks.  Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won.  That would be the greatest loss of all.
Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period, it’s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines.  Have to follow the guidelines that our great Vice President holds up a lot.  He’s holding that up a lot.  He believes in it so strongly.  The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end.
Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread.  On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people.  So we’ll be having lots of meetings in between, but we’ll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday — probably Tuesday evening — on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we’re doing things the way we’re doing them.
We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery.  We think, by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening.
I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease.  We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic.
With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion.  We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage.  We will win.  And when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed.  We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has — and the world — again.
In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse — this is invisible enemy — and rise to incredible new heights.
So I just want to thank you all for being here.  And we’ll take some questions if you’d like.
Yeah, please.  Kelly.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-14/

March 27, 2020
5:56 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Great to have you. And thank you all for being here.  My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic.  It’s been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world.
We’ve had great success over the last month.  We’ve — as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us — purchased and delivered.  And we’ve made it available to the states.  And the governors have been very gracious for the most part, I would say.  There are a couple that aren’t appreciative of the incredible job.  They have to do a better job themselves; that’s part of the problem.
But, generally speaking, I have to tell you the governors have been great.  I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he’s very thankful.  And Governor Cuomo has been very nice.  They’ve — they’ve really appreciated, I think, what the federal government has done.  You look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA; it’s been really incredible.  Nobody has seen — they’ll build hospitals in two or three days — portable hospitals.
This afternoon, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.  Ventilators are a big deal and we’ve delivered thousands of them.  And oftentimes, you don’t need ventilators very much.  Hospitals don’t have very many.  And now we’re — turning out that we have to produce large numbers.  But we’ve been able to do that and we’re going to be doing a lot more.
This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis.  We thought that we had to deal with, as an example, General Motors.  And I guess they thought otherwise; they didn’t agree.  And now they do.  They do agree.  And I think we might be able to pull it.  But we let them know the way we felt, and they can’t be doing that.
We’ll work in partnership with the private sector, but where an emergency exists — and it’s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly — we will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available lawful authorities to get the job done.
This afternoon, I also signed an executive order investing — and very, very strongly investing — the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus — the “invisible enemy,” as we say.
My order also establishes that Peter Navarro — a very trusted person from the White House, and he’s been an incredible — he’s done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going, economically.  But my order establishes that Peter will serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator for the federal government.  That’s a very important position — more important, probably, than it’s almost ever been in our country.
And so I want to congratulate Peter and his family.  It’s — I know he’s going to do a fantastic job.  He’s been doing that job over the last few weeks.  Peter has a PhD in economics from Harvard; has a master in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard.  And he’s a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job.
But I’d like to maybe ask, before I continue, Peter to say a few words, please.  Peter?  Thank you very much.
MR. NAVARRO:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And, of course, you know the Harvard joke: You can tell a Harvard man, you just can’t tell him much.  Right?
THE PRESIDENT:  They can’t tell them much.
MR. NAVARRO:  So, anyway, on a serious note, let me just give you a little idea of the Defense Production Act and why it is so important.  We are engaged in the most significant industrial mobilization since World War Two.  We have a wartime President fighting an invisible enemy.  And we have the full force of government, coupled with the full power of private enterprise, bearing down on this problem for the American people, sir.
What we had to do today with President Trump’s order, with respect to General Motors, I want to give you a little background on that.  We need industrial mobilization to make adequate ventilators, particularly in the very short run, to help people of New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, all around this country, as this virus bears down.  And the ventilators really are the most important thing for patients who become most seriously ill.  They’re literally the lifeline for people.
And I’ve personally been working with FEMA, and I’ve been working with HHS and over 10 ventilator companies, making sure we can get what we need as quickly as possible.  And virtually every one of those companies has been cooperative, patriotic, moving in Trump time — which is to say as soon as possible, sir.
But we did have a problem with GM and Ventec.  On the one hand, we had Ford and GE moving forward on a similar kind of project, patriotically moving as fast as possible.  Over the last several days, we ran into roadblocks with GM.  We cannot afford to lose a single day, particularly over the next 30 to 60 days.  So President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act as a way of enhancing and accelerating this mobilization.  I salute him for doing so. It’s going to make my job so much easier.
For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation from the private sector.  Today, sir, was the right day to do it.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Peter, and good luck.
My administration is marshalling the full power of the American government, and we will do that, and that’s what we’ve done, and we will continue to do it until our war is won.  Economic, scientific, medical, military, and homeland security — all of this to vanquish the virus.
We are working to sign contracts immediately with the major ventilator companies in the country, including GE, Philips, Medtronic, Hamilton, ZOLL, RedMed[ResMed], Hillrom, and Vyaire.  These are all companies that do this — great companies.
The FDA will be reducing and waiving unnecessary regulations in order to get this done.  We’re going to be getting rid of certain, let’s say, barriers to speed.  We want them to get it done quickly.  They’ve been doing it for a long time.  They’ve been making ventilators for a long time.  Hopefully, General Motors will join in the fray.
Under the normal condition that you would be — regular times — 29,000 ventilators are distributed in the United States each year.  In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units.  And I guess, to put it in other words, in the next 100 days, we’ll receive over three times the number of ventilators made during a regular year in the United States, and that doesn’t include all of the thousands and thousands that we’ve — we’ve given to the various states, a lot of them.
We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York and they didn’t know they got them.  And then we also had thousands put in a warehouse, and that was also for New York.  And they just found out that they were there, so we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed.
Earlier today, I spoke to the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun.  And Boeing will be producing and donating face shields to help our medical professionals on the frontlines.  These are actually pretty intricate, in terms of the plastic and the quality of the materials.  They’re important.  They’ve got to be top of the line and they’re going to do thousands of these a week.  They’ve already tested the production and they’re ready to begin producing all of these shields.  That’s the plastic shields that go over the face.
Boeing is also offering us the use of their — what they call the Dreamlifter cargo plane.  It’s the largest plane in the world.  And this is sort of a picture of it.  They called up just a little while ago.  And that can sort of take anything.  That’s the biggest in the world.  And they’re letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially the heavy product or large quantities of product.
And Boeing will dedicate up to three planes to the mission of flying medical supplies anywhere we need it.  Each plane can carry 63,000 pounds of cargo per flight.  That’s a lot of cargo.
I also signed an executive order giving the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security the authority to activate the Ready Reserve components of the armed forces.  This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees.
We have a lot of people — retirees; great, great military people — they’re coming back in — who have offered to support the nation in this extraordinary time of need.  And they come back in.  They don’t say, “How much?”  They don’t say, “What are we getting paid?”  They just want to come back in.  It’s really an incredible thing to see.  It’s beautiful.
This afternoon, I also signed into law $2.2 trillion in urgently needed relief for our nation’s families, workers, businesses, and Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed.  And the $2.2 trillion goes to $6.2 trillion, depending on need.  So it’s the largest — it’s the largest bill ever signed — and not just emergency relief, but of any kind.  We’ve never signed a bill of that magnitude.
And, you know, incredibly, it was 96 to nothing in the Senate and it was essentially the same thing in Congress.  They did it very quickly in the House.  They did it very, very quickly.  So, if you look at Congress — what they’ve been able to do — the House was a voice vote, I guess they would call it, and something like that rarely takes place.  And 96 to nothing in the Senate for the largest bill in the history of our country.  That’s pretty good.
And I want to thank Republicans, I want to thank Democrats for coming together for the whole of the nation.  And this is a great thing, a great victory.  This is going to save companies that are incredible companies, but that are going to need some help because of what happened.  A month ago, they were outstanding.  They were having the best year they ever had and then we got hit.  And so, we’ll help them out.  It’s thousands and millions of jobs.  It’s millions of jobs.  And I just want to thank everybody for working so hard, and that includes the people standing with me right here.
The legislation extends a vital lifeline to American families and American workers with job retention loans for small businesses — and a big focus of the bill is small businesses.  They’re really the — they’re the energy.  They’re whatever you want to call it, in terms of our nation.  They push.  People have no idea how big a factor — Peter can tell you — the small businesses are in this country, from an economic standpoint, from a job standpoint.
We expand the unemployment benefits for workers very substantially and direct-cash payments will be going to American citizens — substantial.  This legislation also provides a massive increase in funding for hospitals for the Disaster Relief Fund and critical supplies, including masks, respirators, and pharmaceuticals of all types.  And, speaking of pharmaceuticals, as you know, we’re working vaccines.  We’re getting some good response and we’re working on therapeutics and cures.  And we have some very interesting things happening.
This afternoon, Apple launched a new tool created in partnership with our task force, the CDC, and FEMA.  Any individual who is concerned that they might have the virus can now download the free COVID-19 app on their iPhone and answer a set of simple questions about their symptoms and risk factors.  It’s getting to be a very modernized system, indeed.  They’ll soon receive HHS recommendations on what to do next, including whether they should get tested or not.  And again, we only want people to get tested if they — if we think they need it.
In a few moments, Secretary DeVos and Secretary Perdue will discuss new partnerships with the private sector that are providing meals to millions of students while schools are closed.  They’ve both been incredible, the job they’ve done.  I appreciate them very much.
We’re grateful for the assistance of Niren Chaudhary, CEO of Panera Bread Company.  They’ve been so incredible to us and to the people of our country.  And Denton McLane, Chairman of McLane Global Logistics.  And they’ve joined us — they’re onstage with me.  They’re going to speak.
Throughout this ordeal, I have been awed and inspired by the American people more than anything else, more than anyone else.  Americans of every walk of life have followed the guidelines, shown incredible compassion, and sacrificed greatly on behalf of their fellow citizens.  I want every American to know that their selfless and heroic actions are saving lives.  And I want them to know, and I’ve said it before, that I’m very proud to be their President.  I’m very proud of the American people.
My administration is actively planning the next phase in an all-out war against this horrible virus.  We’re now testing nearly 100,000 patients per day — more than anybody in the world — and we have now, as of even a couple of weeks ago, tested more than any other country in the world and our capacity continues to grow.
Widespread surveillance testing will allow us to monitor the spread of the virus — and we’re doing that quite accurately, and Deborah and Tony will be speaking about that; and coordinate with states to contain new hotspots as they arise with a targeted, fact-based and data-bra- — based approach.  It’s all data driven.
This surveillance testing will soon enable us to publish updated guidelines for state and local leaders.  We want every county and region in the country to have the on-the-ground evidence that they need to determine the mitigation measures that are right for them.  Each location is different.  Some are very, very different.  Some are day and night.  Some are in great shape and some aren’t in great shape.  And we’ll be able to have very accurate information very shortly.  We already have a lot of that information.
America is bravely battling this pandemic through cutting-edge science, medical innovation, and rational, deliberate, and determined vigilance.  No effort will be spared in winning this war.  We’re going to win the war.  Hopefully, we’re going to win soon and with as few lives as possible lost.  You see what’s going on all over the world.  You see the lives, you see Italy, you see Spain, you see all of these countries going through so much, going through such hell.  And we’re all in very strong communication, I can tell you.  Our professionals are dealing with them every day, many of the countries.  So many countries, but many of the countries, we’re dealing very directly and closely.
And we’re going to be in very good shape, in terms of certain equipment that’s very hard to get, very hard to manufacture.  And, at the right time, we’ll be distributing that equipment throughout the world to other countries.  Boris Johnson was asking for ventilators today.  As you know, Boris is — he has tested — unfortunately, he has tested positive and that’s a terrible thing.  But he’s going to be great.  I’m sure he’s going to be totally great.  But they want ventilators.  Italy wants ventilators.  Spain wants ventilators.  Germany wants ventilators.  They’re all calling for ventilators.  Well, we’re going to make a lot of ventilators.  And we’ll take care of our needs, but we’re also going to help other countries.
So I just want to thank everybody.  I want to thank our great American citizens.  And a lot of incredible things are happening — really happening — and it’s too bad.  I was saying, before we had the press conference, when we signed — we had a signing ceremony, where we signed the largest bill in our history.  And I said, “Think of it: 22 days ago, we had the greatest economy in the world.”  Everything was going beautifully, the stock market hit an all-time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency, and the world was looking good.  And then we got hit by the invisible enemy and now you have countries all over the world reeling.  But we’re winning it, and we’ll be bigger and better and stronger than we were even before.
And we will also have apparatus in place that works.  We won’t have broken systems.  We’ll have incredible systems so if this should happen again — and hopefully it won’t, but if a thing like it should happen again, we’ll be able to handle it very much more easily.
So with that, I’ll take a few questions.  Steve, please?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/

5:26 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Hello.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Beautiful day.  Very good what you’re doing.  Look at all those empty seats.  Never seen it like that.  Oh, boy.  Well, how the world has changed.  How the world has changed, right?  But it’s going to end up being better than ever.
I want to thank you very much for being here.  And I’d like to update you on the steps we’re taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus.
This morning at 7:55, I spoke to the leaders of the G20.  Had a great meeting.  And we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas.  We’re working together.  The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that, right now, 151 nations have got.  We had:
•    President Alberto Fernández of Argentina
•    Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia
•    President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil
•    Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada
•    President Xi of China
•    President Emmanuel Macron of France
•    Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany
•    Prime Minister Modi of India
•    President Widodo of Indonesia
•    Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy
•    Prime Minister Shinzō Abe of Japan.  Congratulations to Japan on making a great decision on the Olympics.  Going to make it next year, 2021.
•    President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico.  I want to thank the President of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military.  We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border, and very few people are getting through — I can tell you that.  And we got to keep it that way.  And we have a great relationship with Mexico now.
•    President Putin of Russia
•    King Salman of Saudi Arabia
•    President Ramaphosa of South Africa
•    President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in: South Korea.  We’re working very hard on that.
•    Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain
•    President Erdoğan of Turkey
•    Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom
•    President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen
•    President of the European Council Charles Michel
•    United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres
•    World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom
•    World Bank President David Malpass
•    and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva
So, that’s a big group but it’s a great group.  It’s — and they were all there — every one of them.  And we talked about the problem.  And hopefully it won’t be a problem for too much longer.
The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts.  We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data — and we’ve been doing that, to a large extent, but we’ll do it even more so — and to inform our — I guess you could say inform each of us on the fight that we’ve got going one way or the other.  It’s a little bit different, but we’re handling it a little bit in different ways.
But there is great uniformity, I think.  We had a — it was a terrific meeting.  Tremendous spirit among all of those countries.  You had 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned.  And tremendous spirit to get this over with.
After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories.  Our team has been in constant communication with the governors, and we had a terrific meeting.
Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, “Oh, we need Tom Brady.”  I said, “Yeah.”  He meant that in a positive way.  He said, “We need Tom Brady.  We’re going to do great.”  And he meant it very positively, but they took it differently.  “They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort.”  That’s only fake news.  And I like Tom Brady.  Spoke to him the other day.  He’s a great guy.
But I wish the news could be — could be real.  I wish it could be honest.  I wish it weren’t corrupt, but so much of it is.  It’s so sad to see.  Just so sad to see.
We had a great meeting.  I tell you what: I’m sure you have tapes of the meeting.  I’m sure that you were able to get tapes very easily.  So you had 50 governors-plus.  And if you had tapes, you’d see it was really — I mean, there was no contention.  I would say virtually none.  I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy, a little bit.  But he’s usually a big wise guy.  Not so much anymore.  We saw to it that he wouldn’t be so much anymore.  But he is — we had a — I mean, I would rate — Mike was there; a lot of the folks in the back were there.  And it was a — it was a great meeting.  It took place at about 12 o’clock.
So we went from the G20 to the governors.  We also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we’re moving through Congress to deliver much-needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses.
I want to thank Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to 0.  And I have to say it’s the largest, by far, and I’m profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need.
The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay.  I think it’s got tremendous support.  When you’re at 96 to nothing — and, as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined, and one — Rand Paul — is — he’s actually got it.  But he’ll — he’ll be better.  He’s been a great guy.  He’s been a great friend of mine, actually.
The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes:
•    Job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll.  That’s pretty good.  Loan forgiveness — keep the workers on the payroll.  That’s pretty good.
•    Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four.
•    Expanded unemployment benefits.  The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.
These are things that — by the way, we have plenty more to go and — but they’re things that nobody has ever had any package like this done.  And I just want to thank them.  Hopefully, it’ll get approved equally easily in the House, really.  I think it will go through pretty well.  From what I hear, virtually everybody.
•    Critical support for the hardest-hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse.
•    Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses, and hospitals.
•    $45 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, more than doubling the amount available.  This is tremendous stuff.
•    $27 billion for the coronavirus response, including $16 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals.
•    $3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and childcare benefits to healthcare workers, first responders, and others on the frontlines of the crisis.  And these are really brave, incredible people, I have to say.  And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don’t even recover.  They’re incredible people.
•    $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement.  We are, as you know, using the Act, but we use it only when necessary.     We use it as leverage.  We generally don’t have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish.
As of today, FEMA has shipped over 9 million N95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves.  And we’re sending more every day, and we’ve got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in.
A lot of great companies are making equipment right now.  The ventilators, obviously they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them.  And we’re going to be in great shape.
We took over an empty shelf.  We took over a very depleted place, in a lot of ways.  As you know, the testing is going very, very well.  And that was obsolete and broken, and we fixed it and it’s been going really good.
And I think, very importantly, the stockpile — we’re really filling it up, and we fill it up rapidly, but we get it out.  Sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead.
And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also.  We’re sort of a — we look — we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing, and if they need help, we do it. But it’s their first responsibility.  Sometimes they just can’t get it, but we load it up and we send it out.  But if we can, we have it sent directly to the state.  We want it to go directly to the point where we want it.
I can now announce something that I think is incredible, what they’ve done in the Navy, because the incredible naval hospital ship the USNS Comfort — which is incredible, actually, when you see it inside — will be underway to New York City on Saturday.
So it’s going to be leaving on Saturday, rather than three weeks from now.  They did the maintenance quickly, and it was going to be there for quite a while longer — another three or four weeks.  And it should be arriving — I told the governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo, that the ship will be arriving in New York Harbor on Monday.
I think I’m going to go out and I’ll kiss it goodbye.  I’ll go — I’ll go to — it’s in Virginia, as you know.  And I will go and we’ll be waving together because I suspect the media will be following.  John, are you going to be following?  Maybe.  You never know.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-12/

5:54 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  So, nice to be with you.  America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus.
I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines, and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat.  More aggressively we commit to social distancing — so important.  Social distancing — such an important phrase.  And we do it right now.  The more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal.
And there are large sections of our country — probably can go back much sooner than other sections.  And we’re obviously looking at that also.  People are asking, “Is that an alternative?”  And I say, “Absolutely, it is an alternative.”
I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida.  That has great significance, as you know, and legal significance.
We’re in a constant grouping, and I can say this: We have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials, including we’ve been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is, by far, the hottest spot.  They’ve got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them.
The governor is doing a very good job.  I spoke to the governor — Governor Cuomo — last night and this morning, and he mentioned that, in his remarks, that he’s using the — that we are using — and I think he feels, because he understands negotiation — he thinks we’re using very appropriately the Defense Production Act.  And we are.  We’re using it where needed.  It’s a great point of leverage; it’s a great negotiating tool.
But I’ve really — I will tell you, there’s tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies.  And I don’t have to use it very much at all.  They want to do it.  As you know, General Motors is involved; Ford is involved; 3M is involved; others are involved.  And they’re all working very hard to produce product — different — all different products.
We had very little product when we came.  We built it up, and we’ve — we give it away as fast as we can to the different states.  We’re also, as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas in New York.  It’s at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center.  We’re doing four hospitals and we’re doing, throughout the state, four medical centers.  They’re somewhat different.
I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge.  I’m working very hard on New York.  It’s really, by far, our biggest problem.  Maybe it will be; maybe it won’t be.  But there’s a lot of good, capable people working on it with us, and our teams are working very well with the state representatives.
We’re also doing some very large testings throughout the country.  I told you yesterday that, in South Korea — and this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon; we had a very good conversation about numerous other things — but they’ve done a very good job on testing, but we now are doing more testing that anybody, by far.  We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks.  And we go up, on a daily basis, exponentially.  So, it’s really good.
By the way, while I’m on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan last night, and I congratulated him on a wise choice.  I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics — 2021.  I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics.  It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full, beautiful Olympics.  It’s going to be very important because it’s probably the first time, maybe ever, or certainly in a long time, that it was on a odd year.  It always on an even year, they tell me.  But he’s going to have a fantastic success, and now they’ll have even more time.  He didn’t need any more time.  Everything was perfectly ready.  What a job they’ve done.
But Japan — I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision.  I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics.  I told him I’ll be there.  I’ll be there.
As we fight to protect American lives, we’re also protecting American livelihoods.  Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families, and businesses.  This legislation, in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes, as you know, sick leave, and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families.
But we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers.  And that’s a big thing: no cost to the employers.  We want to get everybody back, working.
Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything, I believe, ever passed in Congress.  Perhaps, relatively speaking, if you go back — look during the FDR New Deal days — there was something that if you time-value it, you could say it was bigger.  I don’t know.  But this is certainly, in terms of dollars, by far and away the biggest ever, ever done.  And that’s a tremendous thing because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs, and families, families, families.
The Senate bill, as you know, includes:
$350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses
with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers.  They continue paying their workers.  That’s what we want: We want them to keep their workers and pay their workers.  This will help businesses keep workers in the payroll and allow our economy to quickly accelerate as soon as we defeat the virus.
$350 billion in direct cash payments will
be available for every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year.  That would be $3,400, very quickly, for the typical family of four.  Nothing like that has ever been done in our country.
Up to $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits.  The
average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.  Unlike normal unemployment benefits, independent contractors and the self-employed will be eligible.  So you have independent contractors and self-employed people will be eligible for this.
Over $100 billion to support the heroic work of our
doctors, nurses, and hospitals.  They’ve been incredible.
$45 billion for Disaster Relief Fund.  So we
are setting up a fund of $45 billion for disaster relief.  That’s more than doubling the amount available to support my national emergency and disaster declarations.  It’s a doubling up.
$27 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile
with critical supplies, including masks, respirators, pharmaceuticals, and everything you can imagine — because it was very depleted, like our military was depleted.  Now we have a brand-new military.  Never had a military like this.  We have equipment either coming or it’s already come.  For the most part, it’s already come.  But we have a lot of things that will soon be coming — planes, missiles, rockets, lots of things.  But the stockpile was very depleted, like everything else.
This will also include significant funding for the
development of vaccines on top of the $8 billion we approved several weeks ago.
Over $500 billion in support for the hardest-hit
industries, with a ban on corporate stock buybacks, which is something I insisted on, and frankly, I tell you, the Republicans wanted that and the Democrats wanted that.  We want them to use the money for the companies and the planes, or whatever they may be helping to get over this rough patch.  And I don’t think it’s going to end up being such a rough patch.  I think it’s going to, when we open — especially, if we can open it — the sooner, the better — it’s going to open up like a rocket ship.  I think it’s going to go very good and very quickly.
And you’re going to have some tough new limits on executive compensation also.  They need the money.  They’re going to have to, sort of, just make things work, because we’re interested in the workers, the jobs.  And we’re interested in the companies because that’s really what fuels the workers in those great jobs.
And we also have $16 billion in funding for the purchase of
personal protective equipment — you know about that — such as masks and respirators through the Strategic National Stockpile.
I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation and send the bill to my desk for signature.  Without delay, I will sign it immediately.  We will have a signing, and it’ll be a great signing and a great day for the American worker and for American families and, frankly, for American companies, some of which were having the best years they’ve ever had these last few years.  And then, a little bit less than a month ago, they went into a position that they haven’t seen because of the hidden enemy, the virus.
Earlier today, I spoke to leaders of many of America’s amazing nonprofit organizations.  I thanked them for their unwaving [sic] and unwavering devotion to American people, to American families, to our nation.  And they have been fantastic.  They’ve been collecting supplies, distributing food, supporting healthcare workers, caring for vulnerable workers and families.  I encourage them to continue to do it.  But I’ll tell you, the nonprofits have been fantastic; they’ve been great.  They’re great people, actually.  I know a lot of them.
Finally, I want to provide a brief update on the critical supplies.  Through FEMA, the federal government has delivered, or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators — think of that: 9.4 million — 20 million surgical masks, and we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly.  The whole world — you know, it’s not just us; it’s not just the States.  The whole world is trying to get these things — in competition with many, many countries.
I believe today you broke the 150 mark for the virus.  We have 150 countries — over 150 countries where you have this virus.  And nobody would ever believe a thing like that’s possible.  Nobody could have ever seen something like this coming, but now we know, and we know it can happen and happen again.  And if it does, somebody is going to be very well prepared because of what we’ve learned and how we’ve done.  It’s been incredible, how we’ve done.
Remember this: More tests than anybody, by far.  And the news, the reporters, the media always likes to bring South Korea — they called me and they told me, “It’s amazing.  Your testing procedures are amazing.”  Plus, we have a test that’s a very high-level test, and it’s a test that’s very accurate.
3.1 million face shields, 2.6 million surgical gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and almost 6,000 ventilators, which go to the areas of greatest needs.  We sent, over the last day, 4,000 ventilators to New York.  And I spoke with the governor about that; he was happy.  I spoke with the mayor also about that.  Mayor de Blasio, he was very happy.  It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing — that, I can tell you.
Throughout this national emergency, everyday heroes continue to step forward and demonstrate the extraordinary character of our nation, including the people behind me.  By the way, these people are amazing.  They are amazing people and they become — I don’t know, maybe I should just speak for myself, but to me, they’ve become friends.  Maybe they don’t like me.  Maybe they don’t; maybe they do.  I don’t know.  All I can tell you is they’re talented people.  They work very hard.
In Maryland, a 7-year-old boy used his own birthday money to buy meals for dozens of senior citizens.  In Nevada, a college student recruited 90 of her friends to help deliver groceries and supplies to the most vulnerable.  This is happening all over the country.  Thousands and thousands of instances.  I could stand up here all day and tell you about other things.  In Minnesota, hundreds of medical students have volunteered to provide childcare for hospital workers, helping to keep our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, fighting to save lives.
These inspiring Americans remind us that we all have a role to play in winning this great national battle.  And it’s really a worldwide battle.  We’re dealing with other nations all the time.  The people here are — and I am a little bit — I take calls from a lot of people; they’re in trouble.  A lot of countries are in big trouble.
So now we will hear from our great Secretary of the Treasury.  He has been working rather hard, I will tell you.  Steve Mnuchin is a — he’s a fantastic guy and he loves our country, and he’s been dealing with both sides — Republican and Democrat.  He, sort of, lived over in that beautiful building.  It’s a very beautiful building.  To me, one of the most beautiful buildings, actually, in the world.  And he’s gotten to know it, Steve, very well.
So if we could have a little update, Steve, it would be fantastic, as to how we’re doing and what it’s looking like.
Thank you.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And first, let me say, I would like to thank Mitch McConnell for his leadership.  And I’d also like to thank Chuck Schumer for the enormous bipartisan support we had on this bill, and the many senators, both Republicans and Democrats, that work tirelessly over the last five days on all the task force.
As the President said, I got to live in the LBJ room for the last five days, and we couldn’t be more pleased with the unprecedented response from the Senate to protect American workers and American business in this situation.
The President has outlined many of these, but let me just quickly go through them.
Again, small business retention loans: This will cover roughly 50 percent of the private payroll in small businesses where we will immediately make loans that will supply eight weeks of salaries, as long as they keep workers employed and overhead.  And those loans will be forgiven at the end of the period, as long as they keep workers employed.
These are SBA loans, but the Treasury will be issuing new regulations authorizing almost every single FDIC-insured bank to make these.  I expect, by the end of next week, we will have a very simple process where these can be made and dispersed in the same day.  So this will be a very simple system to get money into small-business hands.
For companies that don’t qualify that, we have an economic program of tax incentives to retain workers.  And as the President said, we have enhanced unemployment insurance for people that don’t fit into these two programs that will be administered through the states.
We also have economic impact payments.  These will be, within the next three weeks, direct payments into most people’s deposit accounts.  And for those that don’t have it, we will be having the checks in the mail.
Treasury will have additional authorities.  We have $500 billion that we can use to work with the Federal Reserve for emergency programs that will create up to an additional $4 trillion, if needed, to support American business and American workers in an unprecedented way.
And then, finally, the President mentioned $100 billion to hospitals and $150 billion to states that have specific coronavirus expenses, as well as many additional things.
Mr. President, I especially want to thank you and the Vice President.  You are constantly available to us.  We spoke constantly throughout the day.  You gave us guidance and quick decisions on many issues.
And again, I thank everybody for this great bipartisan work.  This is going to be enormous help for the American workers in the American economy.  The President was very determined that Congress would move swiftly to protect hardworking Americans in business in this unprecedented situation.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Steve.  Great job.
Day and night, right?
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Day and night.
THE PRESIDENT:  Day and night.  We was — that was — that was a lot of work.  And we’ll see how it all goes.  We still need a vote, Steve, don’t we?  Huh?
Do you have a question?  Yes.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-11/

5:43 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Been a very busy day.  I want to thank the American people for the incredible sacrifices that they’re making on behalf of our nation.  And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing: avoiding large gatherings and hand washing, and all of the other things that everybody knows they’re supposed to be doing.
Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy.  Been going for a while, but we’ll win.  We’ll win.
I said earlier today that I hope we can do this by Easter.  I think that would be a great thing for our country, and we’re all working very hard to make that a reality.  We’ll be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done.  Easter is a very special day for many reasons.  For me, for a lot of — a lot of our friends, that’s a very special day.  And what a great timeline this would be.  Easter, as our timeline — what a great timeline that would be.
My first priority is always the health and safety of the American people, and we want everyone to understand that we are continuing to evaluate the data.  We’re working with the task force and making decisions based on what is best for the interests of our fantastic country.
In order to defeat the virus, we must continue to be very strong.  Your resilience and spirit has been inspiring to everyone.  Right now, this virus is attacking 149 countries, but everybody looks to us and they’re watching us.
And I’m very proud to be your President — I can tell you that.  There’s tremendous hope as we look forward and we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Stay focused and stay strong.  And my administration and myself will deliver for you as we have in the past.
Let me provide you an update on critical preparations and supplies in our war on the virus.  Through FEMA, the federal government is distributing more than 8 million N95 respirators, 14 million surgical masks, and many, many millions more are under order, and they’ll be arriving soon.  2.4 million face shields, 1.9 million surgical gowns, 13.5 million gloves, and more than 4,000 ventilators to the areas of greatest need have already been sent.  And we have 4,000 being delivered to New York.
The federal government is using every resource at its disposal to acquire and distribute critical medical supplies.  The core element of this strategy is my executive order authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act, which has, as you know, already been activated, actually, a long time ago — quite a long time ago.
Private companies are heeding our call to produce medical equipment and supplies because they know that we will not hesitate to invoke the DPA in order to get them to do what they have to do.  It’s called leverage.  You don’t have to use it from the standpoint of — actually, it’s been activated, but you don’t have to use it.  But the threat of it being there is great leverage.  And companies are doing as we ask, and companies are actually — even better than that, they’re coming through and they’re calling us.  And it’s been, really, something to see.
This morning, Ford, 3M, and General Electric Healthcare are making tremendous numbers — they’ve already started — of respirators ventilators and face shields.  They’re working together.  We didn’t have to exercise or utilize the DPA in any way.  The fact that we have it helps, but we didn’t have to.  And for the most part, we won’t have to.
We’re receiving full cooperation from companies with the understanding that the federal government stands ready to compel cooperation if need be.  We haven’t found that to be the case.
It’s been really amazing to see these big, strong, powerful — in some cases, very small companies, family-owned companies, step up and make a lot of great product for what we’re going through and what we will continue to be going through for a while.
The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard are building four hospital facilities in New York City at the Javits Center, which will be operational very soon.  They’ve already started.
In addition, they’re building four separate medical facilities in different parts of the state.  We’re dealing with Governor Cuomo on that.  So you’re going to have four hospitals and four medical facilities at the highest level, too.  Really incredible facilities.  Temporary but incredible.
We’re also deploying the U.S. Navy hospital ship, and that will be arriving in New York Harbor in the not-too-distant future.  It’s finishing its maintenance.  They’re doing a very big maintenance, and what we did is we condensed it very seriously.  And, as you know, the other hospital ship — and these are incredible ships — it’s already on its way to Los Angeles.
So we’re in frequent contact with state and local officials, and getting a lot of work done.  We’re, likewise, building hospitals in Los Angeles.  We’re working also — the State of Washington.  We’re working with the governor of the State of New Jersey.  We’re building a medical facility, a hospital facility, and doing a lot of work.
I want to thank the people from FEMA — the great people from FEMA — and also the Army Corps of Engineers.
Secretary Mnuchin and the members of my administration continue to work closely with Congress.  I’m pleased to report that we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history.  Senators will soon, hopefully, vote on a $2 trillion bill that will deliver direct cash payments to struggling Americans.  No fault of their own.  This came out of nowhere.  Nobody can imagine this even happened.  But it’s not their fault.
We want to protect, and we will, all of the things that a person needs protected and a family needs protected.  We’re working on job retention, loans for small businesses, and extended unemployment insurance for laid-off workers.
The legislation will also include billions of dollars for additional resources for our, really, heroic — these are incredible doctors, nurses — brave — and hospitals, as well as support for hard-hit industries such as the airline industry and the cruise ship industry, which employ tremendous amounts of people and obviously serve very important functions beyond that.
With very tough protections for the American taxpayer, the loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable and, at the same time, they’ll bridge — they call them bridge loans.  In many cases, they’ll be bridging these companies back into very good health.  Some of them are very important companies that four weeks ago didn’t have a problem.
I’m also confident that the Democrats will do the right thing.  I feel very confident.  They’re working very hard together right now — Republicans and Democrats — and they’re getting very close to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country.
Today, as you probably saw, the Dow surged over 2,100 points.  That’s the all-time record in history of the Exchange.  This is very encouraging.  And I think part of the reason is they are looking at what is close to being passed, and I think a very big part of it is they see that we want to get our country opened as soon as possible.  They see we’re working very hard on that.  That’s a very big factor, I think, in today’s historic gain.
The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America’s economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen our country for business, and we hope that’s going to be very soon.
I want to assure Americans that we have a team of public health experts.  You’ve gotten to know them as well as I know them; they’re great people.  Incredible.  Talented.  They love our country.  Also, economists and other professionals working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right — one based on the best science, the best modeling, and the best medical research there is anywhere on Earth.
Our great people have been — especially when it comes to our public health experts and officials — have been helping other countries, dealing with other countries, constant touch with other countries, helping them out, because many of them have never seen anything like what’s happening.
But our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening.  I’m also hopeful to have Americans working again by that Easter — that beautiful Easter day.  But rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely on the health, safety, and wellbeing of our citizens.
This is a medical crisis; this isn’t a financial crisis. But it’s a thing that nobody has seen for many, many decades. Nothing like this.  Marshaling our economic strength is a key feature of defeating the virus, producing the material supplies and equipment that we need.  And they’re doing a really fantastic job.
We’re helping the governors.  We had a conference call the other day with governors, and we allowed the press to join us in the call.  And the spirit between us and the governors has been really great.
We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival.  I think we’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot.  This crisis has underscored just how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector.
For three years, we’ve embarked on a great national project to secure our immigration system and bring back our manufacturing jobs.  We brought back many jobs — records numbers — record numbers of jobs.
And this really shows — this experience shows how important borders are.  Without borders, you don’t have a nation.
Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospitals, and American equipment for our great American heroes.
Now, both parties must unite to ensure the United States is truly an independent nation in every sense of the word.  Energy independence — we’ve established that.  That’s something incredible that we have established.  We’re energy independent, manufacturing independence, economic independence, and territorial independence enforced by strong, sovereign borders.
America will never be a supplicant nation.  We will be a proud, prosperous, independent, and self-reliant nation.  We will embrace commerce with all, but we will be dependent on none.
Above all, we know that the best thing for our economy and the world right now is a very, very powerful victory over the virus.  Every day, the American people and showing the unity and resolve that has always defined the character of our nation.
In New York, citizens are using 3D printers to make hundreds of the face shields.  They’re making them by the hundreds.  In Texas, businesses and churches are uniting to collect gloves and thermometers for hospitals.
In the selfless actions of our amazing citizens, we’re seeing enduring strength of our magnificent nation, a spirit that can never be broken, and a victorious future that can never be denied.  It never will be denied.
Now, what I’d like to do is, perhaps, ask a person who has really established herself as maybe the world’s great expert on what she does — if I could ask Deborah to come forward and say a few words.  And then I’ll ask Tony to come up and speak, and then our Vice President.  And then we’ll take a few questions, and we’ll do it quickly.  And we’ll probably see you again tomorrow.
So, Deborah, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think those of you who heard at the town hall, we are continuing to accelerate testing at a record rate.  We now have 370,000 tests that have been done.  The majority of those — over 220,000 in the last eight days, which, those of you who have been tracking the South Korea numbers, put us equivalent to what they did in eight weeks that we did in eight days.
This was made possible because of the HHS team working together, bringing together the strength of the FDA with the CDC, and the leadership of Secretary Azar.  We’re very proud of those numbers, but we know that we have to do more, and we continue to accelerate in testing to ensure that those who need the tests are tested first and have access.
As we talked about yesterday, we’re working on the ability for people to take their own sample.  That does not mean home testing.  That means taking your own sample in the front of your nose with available swabs into normal saline that can be transported to the laboratories.  That will allow and free up all of the drive-throughs to be very sparing on PPE, because you’ll be able to do that with gloves rather than the full PPE outfits.  This will allow for more of that PPE to be dedicated to our hospitals.
I think those of you who are tracking this epidemic closely, like I am, you will begin to see that there is encouraging results coming out of Italy.  We are impressed by the decreases that are seen in mortality, the number of people succumbing to this illness, and the number of new cases.
Our new cases will continue to surge because we’re still working on our backlog, although we will be in touch with the laboratories after this press conference to really find out how many are still in backlog and how many were run in the last 24 hours.  Until we get into a 24-hour cycle, we’re going to have a disproportional number of new cases compared to the actual new cases, and we will let you know when we have reached that equilibrium.
Finally, and I know Dr. Fauci will talk about this further, we remain deeply concerned about New York City and the New York metro area.  About 56 percent of all the cases in the United States are coming out of that metro area, and 60 percent of all the new cases are coming out of the metro New York area, and 31 percent of the people succumbing to this disease.
It means, because they still are at the 31 percent mortality compared to the other regions of the country, that we can have a huge impact if we unite together.  This means, as in all places, they have to be following the presidential guidelines that were put out eight or nine days ago.  And this will be critical.
But to everyone who has left New York over the last few days: Because of the rate of the number of cases, you may have been exposed before you left New York.  And I think, like Governor DeSantis has put out today, everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina, or out to far, far reaches of Long Island.
We are starting to see new cases across Long Island that suggest people have left the city.  So this will be very critical that those individuals do self-quarantine in their homes over these next 14 days to make sure they don’t pass the virus to others, based on the time that they left New York.
So if they already are 4 days out, then it’s just 10 more days.  So I thank you if you help get that message out to others.
Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President and Deb.  I want to just talk very briefly about two or three things.
First, the issue of testing and how that has really changed the complexion of the approach that we’re going to be able to take.  We right — know testing was an issue.  We had many questions of testing in this room for a number of times.  Now that we literally have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of testing out there, there are a few things that we can do with that.
One of the things is that when we make policy about what we’re going to be doing with the rest of the country, particularly those areas that are not hotspots, we need to know what the penetrance of infection is there.  So we need to put a light on those dark spots that we don’t know.  We have to act, policy wise, on data.  And we’re going to be getting more data — a lot more data.
The other thing is that the areas of the country that are not hotspots, that are not going through the terrible ordeal that New York and California and Washington State are going through, they still have a window of significant degree of being able to contain.  In other words, when you test, you find somebody, you isolate them, you get them out of circulation, and you do the contact tracing.
When you have a big outbreak, it’s tough to do anything but mitigation.  We have an opportunity now that we have the availability of testing to do that.  So you’re going to be hearing more about how we can inform where we’re going, particularly because we have the ability to test.
The second thing is, I just want to reiterate what Dr. Birx said about New York.  It’s a very serious situation.  They’ve suffered terribly through no fault of their own.  But what we’re seeing now is that, understandably, people want to get out of New York.  They’re going to Florida.  They’re going to Long Island.  They’re going to different places.
The idea, if you look at the statistics, it’s disturbing.  About one per thousand of these individuals are infected.  That’s about 8 to 10 times more than in other areas, which means when they go to another place, for their own safety, they’ve got to be careful, monitor themselves.  If they get sick, bring it to the attention of a physician.  Get tested.
Also, the idea about self-isolating for two weeks will be very important, because we don’t want that to be another seeding point to the rest of the country, wherever they go.
And then thirdly, just one — one just comment about drugs and the testing of drugs.  You know, you heard yesterday about drugs being out there that physicians, on an off-label way, can prescribe it to give people hope of something that hasn’t been definitively proven to work, but that might have some hope.
I don’t want anybody to forget that simultaneously with our doing that, we’re also doing randomized clinical trials on a number of candidates.  You’ve heard about candidates, but there are others in the pipeline, where we’ll be able to design the study and, over a period of time, particularly since we have so many infections, we’ll be able to determine definitively are these safe and are they effective.  We’re talking about remdesivir, other drugs, immune sera, convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies.  All of these are in the pipeline now, queuing up to be able to go into clinical trial.
So I’ll stop there and (inaudible).
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Tony.  Great job.
Larry, how about just a quick few minutes on how we’re doing over at the Hill, please?
MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.  We’re mak- — we’re gaining great progress on this phase three legislation.  Negotiations continue.  We’ve had continued reports.  I’ve been up there with Secretary Mnuchin.  Secretary Mnuchin continues today with the Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, checking in with the President.  They’re getting closer and closer.  They expect a vote as soon as possible.
I just want to walk through a couple of key points.  This legislation is urgently needed to bolster the economy; provide cash injections and liquidity; and stabilize financial markets to get us through a difficult period — a difficult and challenging period in the economy facing us right now, but also to position us for what I think can be an economic rebound later this year.
We started the year very strong.  And then we got hit by the coronavirus in ways that probably nobody imagined possible.  We’re dealing with that as best we can.
This package will be the single-largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States.  The single-largest Main Street assistance program in the history of the United States.
Phase two delivered the sick leave for individuals — hourly workers, families, and so forth.
Phase three, a significant package for small businesses.  Loan guarantees will be included.  We’re going to take out expenses and lost revenues.  As the President said, eligibility requires worker retention.  We will maintain the people eligible.  We’ll maintain their payrolls during this crisis period.  And, on top of that, we will have direct deposit checks of roughly $3,000 for a family of four and that will bridge to enhanced, plussed-up unemployment insurance benefits that will essentially take those up to full wages.  This is one, two, three, four.
You know, a strong workforce requires strong business.  You can’t have a job without a business to work for.  And the hope here is that — the companies that were operating very well at beginning of the year when the economy was in good shape, we will help them and their employees get through this tough period so they will come out the other side — let’s say this — later this spring or summer — and will continue their operations.  That’s the key point.
Now, don’t forget there’s income tax deferrals for individuals and corporations without interest and penalties.  There is student loan interest and principle deferrals without any penalties.
And finally, I want to mention, the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Refund.  That will be replenished.  It’s important, because that fund opens the door for Federal Reserve firepower to deal a broad-based way throughout the economy for distressed industries, for small businesses, for financial turbulence.
You’ve already seen the Fed take action.  They intend to take more action.  And in order to get this, we have to replenish the Treasury’s Emergency Fund.  It’s very, very important; not everybody understands that.  That fund, by the way, will be overseen by an oversight board and an inspector general.  It will be completely transparent.
So, the total package here comes to roughly $6 trillion: $2 trillion direct assistance, roughly $4 trillion in Federal Reserve lending power.  Again, it’ll be the largest Main Street financial package in the history the United States.  Liquidity and cash for families, small business, individuals, unemployed, to keep this thing going.
We’re headed for a rough period, but it’s only going to be weeks, we think.  Weeks and months.  It’s not going to be years, that’s for sure.  And hopefully pave the way for continued economic recovery after this crisis departs.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Larry.  I’ve been hearing that voice for so many years — like 30 years or more, maybe.  And it’s a great voice and it’s a great man.  So Larry Kudlow, thank you very much.
MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I want to say that that package — and we went over parts of it, but pretty big parts — it really sets us up to, I think, even supersede where we were a month ago.  I think we can get up there quickly and I think it allows us to supersede.  It allows us to help these great companies that need help, like Boeing, which is — you know, it had a problem and then, on top of that problem, it had the virus come in.  But we’ll be helping Boeing.  We’ll be helping the airlines.  We’ll be helping the cruise lines.  We’ll be doing a lot of things and the money will all come back to us, and it will come back to us in a very strong form.
And before we take some questions, I’d like to ask our great Vice President to say a few words, if you wouldn’t mind.  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:   Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met again today.  And on behalf of the President of the United States, everyone on our team, and our state leaders, let me just say: Thank you, America.  People across this country, businesses large and small are responding to the threat of the coronavirus in ways that are deeply inspiring.
Now, people are acting on the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread” and it is making a material difference.  Our experts standing beside us told us that if every American — regardless of whether you’re in an area that’s impacted by an outbreak of the coronavirus or not, if every American would embrace these guidelines, that we could significantly reduce the number of Americans that would contract the coronavirus and protect the most vulnerable.  And as the President reflected earlier, tens of millions of Americans are doing just that and we’re grateful.
The focus of our task force, of course, is to slow the spread, to promote mitigation strategies.  Beyond that, though, the President has us focused on testing and on supplies, and making sure that those that are enduring the symptoms of the coronavirus and those who are ministering to them — our extraordinary healthcare workers — have the support that they need.
In the category of supplies, you just heard Dr. Birx indicate that we’ve made great progress.  We have done more tests in the last eight days than were done in the previous eight weeks.  And it’s because of the public-private partnership that the President forged with commercial labs.
And I would encourage people around the country to remind your family members and friends: If you don’t have symptoms, don’t get a test.  We want to make sure that people who are having symptoms, who have a concern have the ability to be tested and to have those tests processed.
We’re continuing to urge all county hospitals, all labs around the country to report to the CDC all the results of the test, as it’ll give these experts around us the ability to continue to advise the President on best practices.
As I mentioned, we — we all continue to follow the outbreak around the country and the test results.  But as several have mentioned, we’re particularly focused on New York.  The reality is the New York metro area was 60 percent of the new cases in the country.
And specifically, as a lay person, I can tell you that the infection rates are roughly 1 in 1,000 in the New York City metropolitan area, where they are 0.2 percent per 1,000 or 0.1 percent for 1,000 in places like Washington State.
It is the reason why today the White House Coronavirus Task Force is calling on any American — first and foremost, if you’re in the New York City metropolitan area or elsewhere — to take the guidelines that we issued and avoid nonessential travel.  But for anyone in the New York metropolitan area who has traveled, our task force is encouraging you to monitor your temperature, be sensitive to symptoms, and we are asking anyone who has traveled out of the New York City metropolitan area to anywhere else in the country to self-isolate for 14 days.
We have to deal with the New York City metropolitan area as a high-risk area.  And for that reason we’re — we’re taking these steps and ask you for the cooperation of the American people.
Because of the spread in New York City, we will continue to surge resources.  The President has described this.  FEMA is coordinating with New York State for the arrival of the USS Comfort in just a matter of a few short weeks.  Over the next 24 hours, more than 4,000 additional ventilators will be delivered to New York State as well.
New York State has prioritized three alternative medical facilities, and, at the President’s direction, the Army Corps of Engineers is working on plans to build those facilities out.
You’ve heard the President speak about the Javits Center — the addition of 1,000 beds.  And we’ll continue — I want the people of New York City and the Greater New York City area to know that we’re with you.  We’re going to continue to provide resources to support your state and local officials as they confront the spread of the coronavirus in that great city.
On the subject of supplies, we had team meetings today at FEMA, which is working on identifying the critical personal protective equipment and ventilators.  At this point, FEMA informs us today that they are distributing 7.6 million N95 respirator masks, more than 14 million surgical masks, and FEMA has already shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York, 36 pallets of personal protective equipment to the State of Washington.
We’ll be meeting again tonight.  As you know, the President stood FEMA, as the National Response Center, up and they are in the lead for the — the approach to the coronavirus, which is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported.  And we’ll continue to surge those resources and make sure that they’re available.
One last word, if I may: The President reflected on the response that businesses around the country have brought to this moment.  It truly is extraordinary.
Now, the President did initiate the Defense Production Act last week, but as the President has reflected many times, we will use the Defense Production Act if we need it to mandate production of — of critical supplies.  But so far, no one has said no.
And, in fact, we see industry stepping up.  The President mentioned Ford Motor Company working with 3M and GE Health to expand production of medical supplies.  We heard that McDonald’s is now offering curbside delivery to truckers who are unable to use the drive-through to pick up a Big Mac.
And I spoke today, and the President spoke last week, with Tim Cook of Apple.  And, at this moment in time, Apple went to their storehouses and is donating 9 million N95 masks to healthcare facilities at — all across the country and to the National Stockpile.
There is a level of generosity that I know is inspiring to the President and is truly inspiring to all of us who are working on the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
The President has made it clear that he hopes — in weeks, not months — to be able to open up the country.  But let me make one last encouragement to every American: We will get to that day quicker if every American will put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines for our nation: “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  If every American will do this, I have no doubt that we will slow the spread, we will protect our most vulnerable, and we will heal our land.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mike.  Thank you.

March 23, 2020
6:11 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  And I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem, and we appreciate you being here.  And this is getting to be more and more social distancing, and that’s fine.  That’s the way it should be, and it’s too bad.  We extend our best wishes to the person affected.  And we feel sure that he or she will be better very soon.
And thank you for being here.  America continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus.  I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge.  The hardship will end; it will end soon.  Normal life will return.  And our economy will rebound very, very strongly.  But, right now, in the midst of this great national trial, Americans must remain united in purpose and focused on victory.
To every single American, please know that the sacrifice you’re making at this time is saving lives — many, many lives.  It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world.  They’re amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form.  They’re working closely with us to get rid of it.  We will prevail together.  It’s very important.
From the beginning, we have been working closely with our nation’s best scientists and medical professionals, and we will continue to do so until we have defeated the virus.  Our public health experts, who are terrific, are studying the variation in the disease across the country, and we will be using data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time.
We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the okay — meaning the okay to get going, to get back; let’s go to work.
Our country wasn’t built to be shut down.  This is not a country that was built for this.  It was not built to be shut down.
My administration continues to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on an urgent relief bill for the millions of American workers and small businesses and large businesses that were badly affected by the medical difficulty that we’ve had.
If you had a viable business in January, we are committed to ensuring the same is true in the coming weeks.  In fact, we want to make it even better than it was before, and we’re doing things to help in that regard.
America will again, and soon, be open for business — very soon — a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting.  A lot sooner.  We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.  We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem.
At the end of the 15-day period, we’ll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing.  And essentially, we’re referring to the timing of the opening — essentially, the opening of our country, because we have it pretty well shut down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy.
Two weeks ago, we moved at record speed to pass paid sick leave and paid family medical leave and approve $8 billion, including money for the development of treatments and vaccines.  And we’re doing tremendous work in both — on both fronts.  The vaccines are coming along very quickly.
Now Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written, and avoid playing any more partisan games.  They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics.  And I think that’s happening.  I got a call a little while ago; I guess they’re getting closer.  It should go quickly and must go quickly.  It’s not really a choice.  They don’t have a choice.  They have to make a deal.  This should not be a time for political agendas but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people.
We are going to save American workers, and we’re going to save them quickly.  And we’re going to save our great American companies, both small and large.  This was a medical problem.  We are not going to let it turn into a long-lasting financial problem.  It started out as a purely medical problem, and it’s not going to go beyond that.  We’re just not going to allow that to happen.
Our country was at its strongest financial point.  We’ve never had an economy like we had just a few weeks ago, and then it got hit with something that nobody could have ever thought possible.  And we are fixing it.  We’re fixing it quickly.  And I want to just thank the American people for what they’ve been through and what they’re doing.
Our country will be stronger than ever before, and we fully anticipate that.  And it won’t be that long.
Let me provide you with an update on critical supplies:  FEMA is distributing 8 million N95 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now, focusing on the areas with the greatest need.  We have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the State of Washington.
In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks.  We’re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak, and other personal protective equipment, which we will be distributing to medical hotspots.  We’re focused on some of the hotspots across the nation.
We’re seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas widely shared between the federal health leaders, governors and mayors, the scientific community, and members of the private sector.  Really working together.  Everybody is working together.
I’m pleased to report that clinical trials in New York will begin existing for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus.  At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of chloroquine.  And you can look from any standpoint tomorrow, in New York — we think tomorrow pretty early — the hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination, probably, is looking very, very good.  And it’s going to be distributed.
We have 10,000 units going, and it’ll be distributed tomorrow.  It’ll be available and is now; they already have it.  They’re going to distribute it tomorrow morning to a lot of people in New York City and New York.  We’re studying it very closely, watching it very closely.
You probably saw a couple of articles today came out where a gentleman — they thought he was not going to make it.  He said goodbye to his family.  They had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over.  His family thought he was going to die.  And a number of hours later, he woke up, felt good.  Then he woke up again, and he felt really good.  And he’s in good shape.  And he’s very happy for this particular drug that we got approved in record-setting time.  There’s never been anything even close to it.
And I want to thank the FDA, which has been incredible, and Dr. Hahn — Stephen Hahn — a highly respected man.  But they’re doing everything possible to increase production and available supply of these drugs — not only this drug, but also others that are coming.  Remdesivir is coming from Regeneron.  A couple of others are also under study.
But the one that I’m very excited about right now is the one we just mentioned.  And I think there’s a real chance.  I mean, again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact.  It would be a gift from God if that worked.  That would be a big game changer.  So we’ll see.
But distribution starts tomorrow morning, early, in New York.  And I think a lot of people are going to be — hopefully they’re going to be very happy with the result.  But we’re all going to be watching closely.  It’s something we have to try.  It’s been very, very successful on malaria.  Very, very successful.
And countries with malaria have had a interesting thing happen.  They take this particular drug — it’s a very powerful drug — and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries.  And there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the malaria.  So we’ll see what happens.
I’m also announcing that we’re postponing the deadline for compliance with REAL ID requirements.  At a time when we’re asking Americans to maintain social distancing, we do [not] want to require people to go with their local DMV.  We will be announcing the new deadline very soon.  It’s going to be announced in a very short moment.
Overnight, we successfully brought home 103 American citizens after they had been stranded for 10 days in Brazil, following a cruise.  We want to thank the Brazilian government and their great President.  Most of those returned were senior citizens.  My administration, in cooperation with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and the private sector, coordinated their safe return to the United States.  So thank you to Governor Abbott.  Terrific governor, terrific man.
Earlier today, I signed an executive order invoking presidential authority under Section 4512 of the Defense Production Act to prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies such as hand sanitizers, face masks, and personal protective equipment.
We have a lot of face masks; a lot of equipment is coming in.  And we have some people hoarding, and Attorney General Barr is going to be speaking about that in a second.  We want to prevent price gouging, and critical health and medical resources are going to be protected in every form.
Under this directive, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to designate essential health and medical supplies as scarce.  So he’ll designate certain supplies and medical elements as scarce, and that means it will be a crime to stockpile these items in excessive quantities, which is happening to a relatively small degree, we think, but nevertheless it’s happening.  We can’t let it happen.  And we can’t let them resell them at excessive prices, which some people are doing.
Very simply, we will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit.  So we’re going to be watching that with our great Attorney General very closely.
The Department of Justice will be aggressively prosecuting fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic.  Yesterday, federal prosecutors took action in their first case, shutting down a website selling a totally fake vaccine — if you can believe that one.  As President, I will always fight to protect Americans from being exploited.
Thankfully, all throughout the country, we’re witnessing extraordinary acts of compassion, benevolence, and unity.  Construction companies are donating masks by the hundreds of thousands.  Manufacturing workers are transforming their assembly lines.  Citizens are volunteering to deliver food and medicine to the elderly.  We’re truly seeing America at its best.  We’re really seeing things that people never thought even could happen.  Frankly, we never thought this could happen.  But the way most Americans are working toward getting it solved and just doing what they have to do to make this go away has been incredible.  It’s been incredible.
I want to take a moment to thank the everyday heroes who are making our vast effort against the virus possible.  And thank you to the healthcare workers and the first responders.  These are very brave people.  Thanks also to the hardworking men and women of Federal Express, UPS, the United States Postal Service, and the truckers who are maintaining our supply chains and supply lines.  We thank you very much.  Great job.
We also want to give our regards and thanks to everyone at our grocery stores working the night shift so that shelves can be restocked, and the restaurant workers and delivery drivers keeping our families fed.  So many of these restaurants, it’s incredible — they’re doing service where people come and they pick it up — delivery.  I mean, it’s been incredible what they’ve been doing.  Totally different business than they were in, other than they cook food.  Other than that, it’s like a totally different business.
Most of all, I want to thank the American people for rising to the challenge and showing incredible courage, determination, patience, grace, and grit.  From New York to Seattle and everywhere in between, your acts of selflessness and sacrifice and ingenuity are a powerful testament to the American character.  It’s really being shown.  It’s really showing up at a level that people are really respecting.  All over the world, they’re respecting.  And the world has problems.  We’re at 148 countries now.  A hundred and forty-eight countries are affected by the invisible scourge.
And all of the uplifting reflections of the American spirit are out there for everyone to see.  Together, we will care for our fellow citizens.  And we will win this war, and we’ll win it much sooner than people think.  And we’ll be back in business as a country pretty soon.  You’ll be hearing about that also pretty soon.
Now I’d like to ask Attorney General Bill Barr to say a few words.  And we’ll take questions in a little while.
Thank you.
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:  Let me start by thanking you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for your decisive leadership in this unprecedented battle to save American lives.  At the Department of Justice, we’re working hard to protect the health and safety of our personnel, while at the same time keeping our enforcement efforts at full throttle.
So I’d like to thank all of my colleagues and law enforcement, not just those at the federal level, but of all our state and local partners: the police officers, the sheriffs, the deputies who are protecting and serving their communities, often at great risk to themselves.
What I’d like to do here is start with a few remarks about the order that the President mentioned to ensure the availability of critical medical and health supplies from hoarding and price gouging.
On March 18th, the President issued Executive Order 13909 invoking the Defense Production Act with respect to the health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including PPE and ventilators.
We have started to see some evidence of potential hoarding and price gouging.  And so, earlier today, the President signed a second executive order, providing the authority to address, if it becomes necessary, hoarding that threatens the supply of those necessary health and medical resources.
Under Section 102 of the Defense Production Act, the President is authorized to prohibit the hoarding of needed resources by designating those materials as “scarce,” or as materials whose supply would be threatened by persons accumulating excessive amounts.  Once specific materials are so designated, persons are prohibited from accumulating those items in excess of reasonable personal or business needs, or for the purpose of selling them in excess of prevailing market prices.  It is a crime to engage in prohibited activity.
In today’s executive order, the President is delegating to the Secretary of HHS this authority to protect against hoarding by designating these critical items.  Now, no items have been designated yet, and the Department of Justice is going to be working with HHS to identify cases where a hoarding may be impeding the supply of health and medical resources needed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Today, we convened our first task force meeting — a national task force that will be working on the supply chain issues and specifically on the problem of hoarding and price gouging.  And we are designating in each of our 93 United States Attorney’s Offices a lead prosecutor who will be responsible in that district for pursuing these cases.
I will also want to say that we have not waited for this order to be signed.  As we have received evidence recently, we have already initiated investigations of activities that are disrupting the supply chain and suggestive of hoarding.
I want to stress that we’re not talking about consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations.  We’re talking about people hoarding these goods and materials on an industrial scale for the purpose of manipulating the market and ultimately deriving windfall profits.
If you are — have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about.  But if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks — surgical masks — you will be hearing a knock on your door.
So with that, Mr. President, I’ll turn it back to you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Deborah, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  To start, I want to really thank all the ministers of health around the world who have been sending us their data, despite the fight that they’re in themselves, particularly our European colleagues.  They continue to send us, primarily, their mortality data, which is really very critical, because when you’re in the midst of this level of fight — that many of the European countries are — following mortality data will give you the best insight right now on how the epidemic is proceeding in those countries, because they really can’t be testing at the level to really understand the depth and breadth of their new cases.
In the mortality data that has been provided to us, there has been no child under 15 that has succumbed to the virus in Europe.  There was the one 14-year-old in China.  So we still see that there is less severity in children, and so that should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there.
To Generation Z and to my millennial colleagues who have been really at the forefront of many of these responses: Less than 1 percent of all the mortality is less than 50.  And so this is, I think, also a very important point.
That doesn’t mean that individuals won’t have severe disease.  So still 99 percent of all the mortality coming out of Europe, in general, is over 50, and preexisting conditions.  The preexisting condition piece still holds in Italy, with the majority of the mortality having three or more preexisting conditions.
I think this is reassuring to all of us, but it doesn’t change the need to continue to protect the elderly.  And in order to protect the elderly, we all need to continue to do the President’s directives and guidance for the next week of the 15-day challenge.
Finally, I wanted to really close by thanking the laboratory personnel that have been at the frontlines.  Two hundred and fifty thousand tests have been run in the last seven days.  This happened because these large commercial laboratories are doing around-the-clock runs.  And remember, all of them are being exposed to the virus in the same way from the swabs, yet tirelessly they have worked on and on to get those results available.
They are still getting more tests than they can run per day.  That’s because we were primarily expanded into the — what we call the “Roche high-throughput TriCore machine.”  Those results have been getting to the clients, and we’ve asked them to prioritize hospitalized patients.
There was a breakthrough today, and I think you’ll see this from the FDA, in — for all of those of you who are waiting for self-swabbing options, those are going to be available sometime this week, to be able to — individuals do their own tests.
That said, remember, these platforms are keeping up with those who need to be diagnosed in the hospitals and those who come to the emergency room quite ill, so the hospital beds can be freed up for those that don’t have COVID.  So that will be critical that if you don’t need a test and if it doesn’t change your clinical course, do not come in to be tested.  And I think that mortality data that I gave you should be very reassuring to all of you.
Finally, to conclude: New York City.  The New York metro area of New Jersey, New York City, and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to 1 in a 1,000.  This is five times what the other areas are seeing.  There — through the high-throughput lab investigations, we’re finding that 28 percent of the submitted specimens are positive from that area, where it’s less than 8 percent in the rest of the country.
So to all of my friends and colleagues in New York: This is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time.  Clearly the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Deborah.  Mike, go ahead.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but we also convened, at the President’s direction, a conference call with the nation’s governors and we focused on efforts at mitigation, at testing and supplies.  We discussed the President’s recent approval of disaster declarations for Washington and California and New York.
But we also assured governors who’ve submitted major disaster declarations that we will be reviewing them in an expeditious manner to ensure the full resources of the federal government are brought to bear.
The President wanted us to make it clear that the federal government will do whatever it takes to support an effort that is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.  We reiterated that to our governors today, listened to them about their specific needs, and, frankly, made it clear to them that while the President has published at Coronavirus.gov the “15 Days To Slow the Spread” for every American — and millions of Americans are addressing these commonsense guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the days ahead — we made it clear to the governors that this President and this administration fully supports decisions that governors are making in communities and states that are particularly impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, and we are grateful for their efforts.
We also spoke to the governors about the importance of the legislation that is currently being negotiated on Capitol Hill and asked them to encourage members of the House and the Senate to move very quickly.  The bill that is currently being negotiated, the President said that he believes will be resolved soon.  And we’re encouraged by it.  It will speed direct payments to families.  The average family of four will receive $3,000 directly.  There’ll be payroll subsidies for small businesses around America to keep people on the payroll while they might be required to stay home; unemployment insurance benefits; assistance to hospitals and major industries.  And we continue to urge the Congress to act and ask the governors to engage their delegations.
On the subject of testing, we reiterated our thanks to states across the country that are rapidly expanding testing at drive-through sites and at community sites.  And as Dr. Birx just reflected, because of the unprecedented public and private partnership that the President initiated with our commercial labs, we stand here today with 313,000 tests having been completed, with the test results delivered to Americans, and still somewhat more than 41,000 have contracted coronavirus.
But this state-run effort is continuing to receive the full support of our team at FEMA and at the U.S. Public Health Service.  We’re deploying personnel, we’re deploying resources, and testing is literally expanding around the country by the hour.
As Dr. Birx also mentioned, the FDA has been in the process of reviewing less invasive methods of testing.  The President and I both reflected on the fact that we have been tested and we’ve been working with the FDA to make it possible for self-collected nasal swabs, where individuals could, at the end of their nasal passage, collect a sample.  And I’m pleased to report that self-collected swabs can now be collected in clinics and at drive-through testing sites.
This will expedite the testing process, of course, but it will also reduce the risk to healthcare providers for exposure to the coronavirus, and it will minimize the drain on personal protective equipment.
With the current test that goes pretty significantly up the nasal passage, people have to wear gear and then change out the gear.  And this new self-administered test will actually not require the drain on personal protective equipment.  And it’s all a part of our effort, as Admiral Polowczyk will discuss in just a few moments, to meet the supply needs that we have across the country but to meet them with efforts at conservation as well.
On the subject of testing, it’s important to remember, as the Old Book says, it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.  And so, if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need to get a coronavirus test.  We encourage every American to adhere to that so that the testing resources are available for people that are symptomatic.
We also will be issuing today, from Health and Human Services, new guidance to direct all commercial labs to prioritize testing for hospitalized patients.  And that guidance is going out tonight.  We also reminded the governors today that all state laboratories, all hospital laboratories are now required by law to report the results of coronavirus tests to the CDC.
On the subject of supplies and our meeting today at FEMA, we received a report of the new Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force.  Rear Admiral John Polowczyk is leading that up at FEMA, and the task force is working to identify medical supplies that exist in the marketplace today, to evaluate the National Stockpile, and also working with industries around the country to produce even more of the critical medical supplies.
And as the President said, businesses across America are stepping up and maybe as never before in our history.  3M, in fact, has diverted 500,000 N95 masks from commercial customers, and they’re being delivered today to New York and Seattle.  Facebook, we would acknowledge, has donated their emergency reserve of over 700,000 N95 masks to healthcare workers.  And these are just a few examples of the generosity of businesses.
We’re also seeing companies step forward to repurpose their manufacturing facilities to create ventilators, to create equipment.  And I know I speak for the President when I say how grateful and proud we are for that.
We also discussed with the governors a real breakthrough on the availability of ventilators.  We called on the governors to serve at all — survey all outpatient surgical centers and hospital operating rooms because surgical ventilators that anesthesiologists use, because of an FDA decision rendered this last weekend, those can be easily converted now to ventilators that can be used for people struggling with severe illness from the coronavirus.
And so we called on our governors, in conversations with state leaders, to survey all of their surgical centers and hospital operating rooms to identify that equipment.  And with the new FDA guidelines, they’ll be able to convert those to help meet the needs of ventilators across the country.
We are now eight da
ys into the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread,” and the American people are rising to the challenge.  We’re doing this.  But in the days that remain between now and the end of the 15 days, we’re going to need every American to take this seriously.  Listen to your state and local health authorities where there may be additional and stronger guidance in areas where the coronavirus spread has been more severe.
But for every American, know that the part that you do, that your family does, and that you do in your community to put into practice these principles of social distancing — using a drive-through at a local restaurant — will make an enormous difference in lowering the trajectory of the coronavirus spreading across our country.
It’s going to take all of us, but with the ongoing cooperation of the American people, with compassion, with the ingenuity of American industry, with dedicated leadership at the state and federal level, I know that we can slow the spread, we can protect our most vulnerable, and we will heal our land.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Admiral, please.
REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  So, I’m Rear Admiral John Polowczyk.  I’m the Supply Chain Task Force lead at FEMA.
My task is to increase the supply of critical medical supplies, which include personal protective equipment and ventilators — items like that.
I just want to take a few moments to explain the organization that we’ve stood up this week, in the last few days, and our approach.  So you have a chart behind me.  I have a focused — two focus leads: one on personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and a focus lead on ventilators.
Operating under four lines of effort — the first line of effort you see is “Preservation.”  And the leaders tonight have talked about that — the ability to make our stuff last longer.
“Acceleration.”  We have a team of people that are searching the globe for personal protective equipment, figuring out where it is, figuring out if we need to buy it or just transport it and get it here faster.
We have a line of effort called “Reallocation.”  We’re working with our industry partners to illuminate the supply chain.  There are many vendors, many distributors, all on a separate system.  Nobody has one sight picture for that supply chain.  We’ve brought our industry partners in.  We’re weaving that together to make better allocation decisions and understand where it is and where it needs to go.
We have a line called “Expansion.”  You’ve heard some of that today.  If those that are wanting to convert plants, those that want to get into the business, we have the tools to help them to go do that.
So, two focus areas right now: PPE and ventilators.  Four lines of effort — working the problem of the task to get more here and increase the supplies.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-9/

March 22, 2020
5:55 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Just before we begin, I want to mention we’re working very hard — long — on getting a young group of people out of Peru.  We’ve removed some, and the rest are being removed with the cooperation of the Peruvian government.  And we’re also dealing with Honduras on getting some people out that got caught up.  And we are working on that very well — again, with the Honduran government’s work.  And they’re working with us, so I appreciate that.
We have a couple of other locations that we’ll report to you, and we were able to get a young woman released from a certain area who was being horribly accosted, horribly treated.  And we spoke to General Milley.  General Milley took care of it.  We went in and we got her out.  And we’ll — we’ll report further on that one.  But it’s — that was rough stuff.
I want to thank General Milley.  I want to thank all of the people that were involved and the people that went in to get her.  I want to thank you very much.
As we continue to marshal every resource at America’s disposal in the fight against the Chinese virus, we’re profoundly grateful to our nation’s state and local leaders, doctors, nurses, law enforcement, and first responders who are waging this battle on the ground.
It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines — so important — about social distancing, nonessential travel, and hand washing.  Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American.
I want to just say that Senator Rand Paul — a friend of mine; he’s been a great friend of mine.  He’s been always there when we needed him, when the country needed him.  And, as you know, he just tested positive.  Jose [sic] Díaz-Balart — spoke to him yesterday — tested positive.
And so people are — they’re getting quite close to home, and it’s a terrible thing that’s going on.  The hidden enemy.  I call it the hidden enemy.  And I think they’ll all be fine.  I hope they’re going to be fine.  But I just want to send our regards — and I think I can speak on behalf of our country — to those two great friends of mine.
We’re working urgently with Congress on legislation to support the millions of workers, small businesses, and industries who’ve been hit hard by the virus through no fault of their own.  Our goal is to get relief to Americans as quickly as possible so that families can get by and small businesses can keep workers on the payroll.
This will help our economy, and you will see our economy skyrocket once this is over.  I think it’s going to skyrocket.  It’s a — it’s a pent-up demand.  It’s a built-up demand.  And I guess you really have to say, “Who knows?”  But I think it’s going to be a tremendous day when we win this war — and we will win the war.  We want to win the war with as few — if you look at it — just deaths as possible.  We want to have as few number of deaths as possible.
Today, I’m announcing action to help New York, California, and Washington ensure that the National Guard can effectively respond to this crisis.  The National Guard — these are tremendous people.  They’re fully on alert.  We’ve signed what we had to sign, and it’s been activated.
We’re dealing also with other states.  These states have been hit the hardest.  Actually, pretty much by far, you could say, the hardest.  Everybody can see that.  Just look at the numbers.
And, through FEMA, the federal government will be funding 100 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard units to carry out approved missions to stop the virus while those governors remain in command.  So the governors, locally, are going to be in command, and we’ll be following them and we hope they can do the job, and I think they will.  I spoke with all three of the governors today, and — just a little while ago – and they’re very happy with what we’re going to be doing because we’ll be announcing some other things for those three states and some other states where it’s hit the hardest.
This action will give them maximum flexibility to use the Guard against the virus without having to worry about costs or liability and freeing up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state.
The federal government has deployed hundreds of tons of supplies from our National Stockpile to locations with the greatest need.  In order to assist in those areas, I approved the State of New York’s request for a major disaster declaration — something which Governor Cuomo has been asking for and which I agree.  And we had it done in very rapid fashion.  We approved this on Friday evening, and we are working very, very hard to get all of these things not only signed up but completed and finished and win.
The request from the State of Washington for a major disaster declaration was approved just a little while ago.  It went through the process and we moved it very quickly.  The request from the State of California was just received, and we will have it approved very quickly.  We’ll be working — I told that to Gavin Newsom.  And we are — we’re working on getting that done very quickly; it’ll be done maybe tonight.
We’ve large — we have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way, based on all of this, to those states including: respirators, surgical masks, and gowns, face shields, coveralls, and gloves, with large quantities already delivered to Washington and to New York.
In addition to large quantities of supplies, I’ve also directed FEMA to supply the following: four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the State of Washington.  The governors know.  The supplies en route to California and New York will be delivered within the next 48 hours.
In addition, the Naval Hospital ship, the USNS Mercy — it’s an incredible ship; these two ships are incredible — one on the West Coast; one on the East Coast — will be deployed to Los Angeles to add emergency surge medical capacity.  And they have a tremendous capacity.  They are really something.
I will say that, if you look at some of the things we’ve been doing — and now those numbers have gone up — and just to be a little bit more exacting, we’ve done a presidential approval for request for a major disaster declaration for the State of New York.  Approval of Title 32 National Guard activation for the State of New York.  We’re providing all of this at no cost to the governor.
I spoke with Governor Cuomo.  He’s working hard.  We’re all working hard together.  The relationship has really been amazing.  But it also enables the governor to provide robust National Guard support to the state.  And the 25 percent — we’re going to be waiving that 25 percent cost.  We’re picking up, we’ll be coordinating, and they’ll be doing something with very special people.
Mission assignment of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide support to build out alternate care sites.  They’re doing various alternate care sites, which have now been designated by New York.  Four large federal medical stations of one thousand beds.  These are very complex places, actually, with great equipment and great people.
Strategic National Stockpile order.  And this is as of a number of days ago — so far delivered to New York — and this is the 19th.  We had the N95 respirators — 186,416 delivered.  We’ve delivered 444,078 surgical masks.  Many have been delivered since then.  Face shields — we’ve delivered 84,560 face shields.  Surgical gowns — surgical gowns — 68,944 to New York.  Coveralls — 352.  Gloves — 245,486.  Also, to New York, in terms of what’s been delivered just since then — the numbers are quite large, and we have tremendous numbers of companies also making equipment.
For the State of Washington, we’ve delivered 369,000 N95 respirators, 507,406 surgical masks.  And this is as of about three days ago.  Face shields — 63,788 face shields.  Surgical gowns — 107,850.  Gloves — 240,376.  And we have many, many things pending.  It’s actually not pending; it’s being — they’re being fabricated.  They’re being made.  And they’re moving.  Now, for Washington — so we have four small federal medical stations, 250 beds.  And for Washington — State of Washington — we have three large federal medical stations, 750 beds.  And then you have, as I said, the approval of the Title 32 National Guard.
State of California — again, to be very precise — we’re going to have the approval of the Title 32 National Guard activation.  And we’re providing all of this again, like in New York, at no cost to the governor — meaning to Governor Newsom and the state.  No cost to the state.  It enables the governor to provide robust National Guard support to the state.  So they’re going to have control of the National Guard.  The federal government is sending — these are incredible people that are being sent.
We have eight large federal medical stations with over 2,000 beds, and that’s going to California.  And then Strategic National Stockpile order — we’ve ordered, likewise, hundreds of thousands of different items.  I won’t go into the exact numbers, but the numbers are very substantial.  But we’re having a tremendous additional number sent.
And whatever the states can get, they should be getting.  I say we’re sort of a backup for the states.  And some of the states are doing really well and some don’t do as well.  The ones that don’t do as well need more help, but these are three states that really do need help because they are — they are hit very hard.
And the outpouring from the private sector has also been extraordinary.  I’m pleased to report that Honeywell — great company — has just announced it will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks.  They’re very hard to get.  They’re actually quite complex.  For the U.S. government’s Strategic National Stockpile.  They’ll be immediately then delivered to the various states.
This expansion is already underway, and it’s going to provide a lot of jobs for that state — probably around 500.  The masks will be distributed by the government for the use of the health, safety, and emergency.  And this is for response workers — primarily for response workers.  These are very high-end.
This expansion is in addition to Honeywell’s action to more than double production of its existing personal protective equipment manufacturing plants.  They make a lot of different things and they’re doubling and tripling their production.  They’re going around the clock.
Today, I’m also announcing the launch of a new public-private consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy, and IBM to unleash the power of American supercomputing resources to fight the Chinese virus.  The following leaders from private industries, academia, and government will be contributing, and they’re going to be contributing a lot of different things, but primarily computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccines.  They’ll be working along with NIH and all of the people that are working on this.
But tremendous help from IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy’s national labor — laboratories, the National Science Foundation, and NASA.  They’re all contributing to this effort, and they’re fully in gear.
This afternoon, I also want to update you on the steps we’re taking to protect and serve our country’s 18 million veterans.  These are great people — our amazing veterans.  They’ve shown their eternal loyalty to our nation, and this is the time where they’re in need, and we are going to show our loyalty to them.  We’re being very protective of our veterans.
We’re working on certain hospitals where we may be doing some work — in Louisiana, in particular, and some other states.  Veterans hospitals.  We’re going to be very protective of our veterans.  Some of them are of that very vulnerable age.  And some of them, obviously, are not feeling well.  And some of them are still suffering the wounds of war from many years ago.
Yesterday, I signed vital legislation to ensure that the G.I. Bill will cover distance learning during this emergency.  I also spoke with many of our veteran service organizations, or the VSOs, to describe our unprecedented action.  In February, the Department of Veterans Affairs established 19 emergency operation centers throughout the country.
One of the things that they’ve been trying to get done for many years — you all know this from following me over the last number of years, but we got it done pretty quickly; they’ve been trying to get it done for many, many decades — was Choice.  Veterans Choice and also Veterans Accountability.
Now, if it’s crowded within this — if they can’t get to a doctor — we have great doctors in the VA.  I have to say that.  We have fantastic doctors — as good as they come.  But it’s hard to because of what was bureaucracy, but no longer bureaucracy.  We’ve done a lot of things, in that case, because of Accountability.  When people aren’t doing their jobs or if they’re bad or if they’re sadistic, or if they steal or anything bad happens, we’re now allowed to fire them for — I signed that a year and a half ago.  For many years, you weren’t able to do that.
So the VA is working.  And I was just told by our great leader at the VA, Robert — Robert Wilkie — he said, for the first time, we got the highest marks in the history — highest poll numbers in the history of the Veterans Administration.  It came out a week ago that — that they’re happy.
And, look, one of the reasons that happened — highest in history.  One of the reasons that happened is because of Veterans Choice.  If they have to wait on line, they go and see a private doctor and we pay the bill.  And — and they get better.  They don’t have to wait two weeks and three weeks or two days.  But they get better.  And a lot of times, they waited so long that they would they would have a problem and it would end up being terminal because they couldn’t get the kind of treatment that they deserve.
So, highest poll numbers, highest approval numbers in the history of the VA.  I was just given that information yesterday.
We restricted visitors’ access to 135 veteran community living centers which house nearly 8,000 veterans with chronic medical conditions so that we limit their exposure to the virus.  We want to totally take care of our veterans.  And that’s what we’re doing.
The VA has canceled most elective medical and surgical procedures.  They’re delaying them until after this is gone, after we’ve won.
We began providing lifesaving care to patients who had symptoms across the 171 VA medical centers nationwide.  That’s a big deal.  Under my administration, the VA has also been a leader in expanding telehealth.  Telehealth is becoming a bigger and bigger factor in medicine.
This month, we have taken bold action to cut through the red tape and make telehealth available for millions more Americans during this crisis.  They can speak to a doctor from the safety of their home rather than risk becoming infected or make it a tremendously long trip when, frankly, you’ll speak to a great doctor right from your home.  It’s happening: telehealth.  We’re very much at the forefront of that, too.  We’re very proud of it, and it also takes a big burden off our system.
We continue to accelerate the development of safe and effective vaccines.  We’re also aggressively investigating a number of antiviral therapies and treatments to determine their potential in reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms.
And you know how I feel because how I feel is, on Tuesday, they’re going to be starting it on Tuesday morning and we’re going to have some medications delivered that — we’re going to see if they work.  They certainly are effective in other ways.  And they — they are safe, from the standpoint — is that they’re not — they’re not killing people.  We’re not going to have that.  So, a lot of great things have been happening in that regard.
I just want to finish, and then we’re going to ask a couple of people to say a few words that have been so much in the forefront of this incredible job that we’ve all been given.
But I want to say that I know that this is a challenging time for all Americans.  We’re enduring a great national trial, and we will prove that we can meet the moment.
I want to assure the American people that we’re doing everything we can each day to confront and ultimately defeat this horrible, invisible enemy.  We’re at war.  In a true sense, we’re at war.  And we’re fighting an invisible enemy.  Think of that.
For those of you who are feeling alone and isolated, I want you to know that we are all joined together as one people, eternally linked by our shared national spirit — we love our country — a spirit of courage and love and patriotism.  No American is alone as long as we are united.  And we are united.  We’re very united.  People are saying things now that, three weeks ago, they didn’t talk that way.  We’re very united.
No force is equal to the strength of a uni- — really, a unified America, a united America, an America like we have it right now.
For those worried and afraid, please know: As long as I am your President, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you, and I will not stop until we win.  This will be a great victory.  This is going to be a victory.  And it’s going to be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected.
It’s now attacking — the enemy is attacking 144 countries at this moment.  One hundred and forty-four.  That’s unthinkable.  There’s never been anything like this.  And it’s vicious.  It is vicious.  Some people recover well and some people have a hard time.  We all know that.
But we will be totally victorious.  We will then get our economy up to a level that it was and, in my opinion, beyond — because there will be a pent-up demand.  There is a pent-up demand.  And a lot of — a lot of great things will happen.
But I’m very proud of our country.  I’m very proud.  I’m very proud to be your President.  And it’s just something that’s just — you’re very special people.  So thank you very, very much.
And I’m going to ask, if I might, a combination of — Pete, why don’t start off, okay?  Please.
ADMINISTRATOR GAYNOR:  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
ADMINISTRATOR GAYNOR:  Just a little bit about what we’re doing in Washington, California, and New York.  We understand that the states of Washington, New York, and California are the areas seeing a steady increase in COVID-19 virus cases.
In order to assist with additional needs identified in those areas, the State of New York was approved for a major disaster declaration this morning.  Washington State was also approved earlier today.  California submitted their request, and the President will consider it immediately.
We have medical supplies in route to the states, including respirators, surgical masks, gowns, face shields, coveralls, gloves, with quantities already delivered to both Washington, New York, and California.  And we anticipate additional supplies to be delivered over the next 42 hours to all these states.
Under President Trump’s unprecedented national emergency declaration on March 13, FEMA is assisting state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, including reimbursing eligible emergency protective measures taken at the directional guidance of public health officials in response to this emergency.
All 50 states, the District of Columbia, 5 territories, and 2 tribes are working directly with FEMA under the nationwide emergency declaration for COVID-19.  With the assistance of the FEMA regional administrators, who are throughout the country, we are working to address the needs of state and local officials everywhere.
States, tribal, and territorial governments do not need to request separate emergency declarations to receive FEMA assistance under this nationwide declaration.  The emergency declaration does not authorize direct financial assistance available to individuals, such as disaster unemployment assistance or other needs assistance at this time.
Just a note on the USNS Mercy: Based on analysis of potential needs for hospital beds on the West Coast, the decision was made that the USNS hospital ship, Mercy, would have the greatest impact in California.  The Department of Defense has been given direction to dispatch it to Los Angeles immediately.  DOD has advised that the Mercy can get into position within a week or less of today’s order.
Even though there are more cases right now in Washington, the projected needs for beds in California is five times more that of Washington.  The Mercy will be used to take pressure off local hospitals, other medical needs, and not for treating COVID-19 cases.
And finally, a little bit about the National Guard: The federal government continues to take aggressive action and proactive steps to address the COVID-19 threat as we attack the health and safety — or protect the health and safety of the American people.  It remains our top priority.  The National Guard is especially postured and equipped to assist federal, state, and local agencies, while serving the public.
In response to this unprecedented nationwide operation, President Trump has approved Washington, California, and New York National Guard units under Title thirty- — excuse me, Title 32 status for the COVID-19 response.  The President’s action provide the nation’s governors continued command of their National Guard forces, enabling states to use additional resources to meet the missions necessary in the COVID-19 response.
The National Guard is a viable and responsive avenue to provide a much-needed asset that is state-managed and federally supported.  And I want to be clear: This Title 32 activation does not federalize National Guard members.  The National Guard is still under the authority of each governor.  We’re working constantly with the Department of Defense.  And we’ve had a lot of disinformation circling, and I want to make sure it is understood that this is not martial law.  The Department of Defense, by way of a mission assignment, will lead this task.
And then, finally, we continue to respond to hundreds of requests from governors across the country in filling all their critical needs.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Pete, very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Peter.
THE PRESIDENT:  Peter Navarro?
MR. NAVARRO:  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good evening.  What I want to talk briefly about is the Defense Production Act and to give you the overview here.
Using the full power of private enterprise and the full force from the federal government, my job at the White House is to make sure, tactically — working with FEMA and HHS — that the American people, particularly our healthcare professionals, get the gloves, the masks, and all the personal protective equipment they need.
And I can tell you, sir, that since you signed the Defense Production Act, my job has gotten easier, and let me explain why.  The Defense Production Act, in this context, has two primary functions.  One is mobilization of the industrial base — in this case, the public health industrial base — and the other is allocation of resources, both from the supply chain to the manufacturers, and from the manufacturers to the end users, such as the healthcare professionals.
Now, what we’re seeing on a purely voluntary basis — based on the leadership of this administration — we’re seeing the greatest mobilization in the industrial base since World War Two.  And, every day, I’m working with organizations and companies — National Association of Manufacturing, the National Council of Textile Organizations, and so on — in terms of building up, rapidly, our capabilities to get what you need.
Now, let’s think about what mobilization means.  It can mean, for example, repurposing a factory.  So Pernod Ricard called us last week and they had three hurdles they had to deal with.  They called my office.  Had to make a call to Treasury, FDA, and HHS to clear the path.  We got that done that day.  They started their production that day, moving from alcoholic beverages to hand sanitizers.  And, as we speak, a truck is moving towards New York and will arrive there Tuesday to share with the hospitals over 1,000 gallons of sanitizers.  So that would be that would be a repurpose.
A second example would be one that the President offered with Honeywell.  Again, Honeywell called the White House asking for help from the President.  And what they said is, “Look, we want to do this new factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island.”  They called me on a Friday morning.  And by that night, we had a contract in to HHS.  HHS flipped that immediately.  And I had Honeywell moving people and equipment from Massachusetts to that facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island.  And we’re going to have those masks produced within 30 days, moving on the assembly chain.  So my point is: Mobilization is repurposing, building up capabilities.
And the other portion is, of course, the allocation of resources.  Now, what I can tell you so far is that the Defense Production Act, sir, has given me quiet leverage.  When you have a strong leader, you can take a light hand, initially.
And so what we’ve seen with this outpouring of volunteers from private enterprise — we’re getting what we need without — without putting the heavy hand of government down.
There will be, possibly, cases down the road — and the manufacturers have actually asked me and alerted me of this — where some places in the supply chain, they may have problems that the White House will have to break through using the Defense Production Act.  We won’t hesitate to do that.
The last thing I’ll tell you is that I also get a lot of calls that are very disquieting.  Brokers are offering millions of items, whether goggles, masks, or whatever.  And you go through three different brokers, tracing to a warehouse in LA that’s allegedly got 10 million masks and they might charge you seven times what they cost.  That’s price gouging.
We are going to — message to the hoarders: If you got any large quantities of material that this country needs right now, get them to market or get them to us.  We’ll pay you a fair price.  But if you don’t do that, we’re going to come for you and make sure that doesn’t happen in this country.  And that would be a good use of the Defense Production Act.
So I salute you, sir.  You’ve made my job easier, and I appreciate that.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Peter, very much.  Great job.
Mike, please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The Task Force met this afternoon, as we do every day.
And let me begin today by simply saying thank you to the American people.  And thank you for the way that people across this country — seven days into “15 Days to Slow the Spread” — that people in communities large and small across America are responding, are cooperating, are communicating not just on behalf of their own health and the health of their family, but more importantly, on behalf of the most vulnerable among us.  So on behalf of your President and our entire task force, just “thank you” to the American people.
I also want to express our appreciation to the governors across the country.  The President today just announced action in New York, California, and Washington State as the latest demonstration that this administration will do whatever it takes to support the leadership at the state and local level as the American people confront the spread of the coronavirus.
The legislative efforts that are underway are being negotiated on Capitol Hill as we speak.  The bipartisan spirit that’s taking place there that’s reflected in all of our interactions with state leaders around the country is a great credit to the nation.  But it should be a great encouragement to the American people that your government at the federal level, at the state level, working with courageous healthcare providers all across America, are coming together to meet this moment.
And that is the way our system works.  It’s extremely important that the American people recognize that one of the things that makes America different is that we have a system of federalism and that the — by putting FEMA in the lead, the President has emphasized that our response to the coronavirus is, in the anthem of FEMA, it is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported.
We want the people on the ground — the decision makers — to have what they need.  We want states to be able to manage the unique circumstances in their states.  And whether it be the legislation moving through the Congress or the efforts the President announced today — major disaster declarations, Title 32 on the National Guard, resources flowing, hospital beds flowing — we’re going to continue to make sure that our states have what they need to meet this moment.
Our task force continues to focus on the priorities the President has given us.  They are testing mitigation and supplies.
And on the subject of testing, as is evident to people across the country, testing is more and more available every single day.  And we’ll be detailing tomorrow, from this podium, the progress that we are making on tests.
At this day’s reporting, 254,000 Americans have been tested and received results in coronavirus tests, with slightly more than 30,000 actually testing positive.  There’s a bit of an encouraging word in that for every American.  Remember, everyone that’s being tested now, with the exception of our healthcare workers, are people that have symptoms that make them think they may have the coronavirus.  And as our numbers come in consistently — because the 254,000 does not include all the local hospitals or all the local labs in our states — it’s working out to be: About 1 in 10 Americans who’ve been tested, who thought they had coronavirus, actually had it; 9 out of 10 did not.
But we’ll continue to roll out the testing to provide that resource to the American people.  And we’re working to make testing happen faster.  We expect word from the commercial labs that we should be caught up on the backlog in testing by the middle of the week.  And we are urging today, on the President’s behalf, that all labs would prioritize in-patient testing.
Let me say again to all of the commercial labs in the country: You will receive guidance from HHS tomorrow.  But on behalf of the President and the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we are urging all commercial labs to prioritize in-patient testing.  We want people that have been checked into a hospital, that are being treated for what they suspect to be coronavirus, to receive those tests more quickly.
Also, I’m pleased to report that yesterday the FDA approved an emergency authorization on a new test that should be in production by the end of March.  It actually would be a coronavirus test, the results of which come back in 45 minutes.  And we’re also working — the FDA is working with manufacturers around the country to come up with even faster, more innovative tests.  And as we told our governors in several calls this week, governors and state health officials should simply contact FEMA for the latest information on testing solutions.
Let me also say: Tomorrow, when we gather at this podium, we’ll be unveiling, with Dr. Bob Redfield in the lead, new guidance for people that work in law enforcement, first responders, people that work in what we call “critical infrastructure” in the country.
It was in early March that CDC issued guidance for people that were asymptomatic or did not have symptoms but who had been exposed to someone with coronavirus who gave them guidance about being able to return to work wearing a mask for 14 days.  And tomorrow, at this podium, CDC will unveil, in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security, new guidance, which will make it possible for people that have been exposed to return to work more quickly with — by wearing a mask for a certain period of time.
Let me also amplify a point on behalf of the President and on behalf of the State Department about Americans abroad.  You know, one of the — one of the reasons why the United States is in a different position today than portions of Europe are — and China and elsewhere — is because the President suspended all travel from China.  He suspended travel from Europe and the UK and Ireland.
But the State Department is working around the clock to assist Americans who may find themselves overseas.  They’re able to come home; there’s no barrier to Americans coming back to American soil.  They’re screened, when they come home, through a series of airports.  But we’re aware that, with flights being canceled, some Americans have found themselves unable to find a way home.  And as the President said, we’ve been working very diligently, through the State Department, to make it possible.  Commercial flights have been chartered.  We’re also working with the military for backup on flights.
At this point, the State Department has brought more than 3,000 Americans back home.  But speaking to the Secretary of State today, he wanted me to share a website and a phone number for any American that might be looking on from overseas.  You can call the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program at 1-888-407-4747 or you can go online at STEP.State.gov.  This will allow our embassies and consulates to gather important information about your situation and work to facilitate to bring you home.
Let me say, finally — as I began, let me close — as the chairman or the leader of this White House Coronavirus Task Force: We are 7 days into 15 days, and the American people are responding.  Because as we speak about supplies, as we speak about testing, the most important thing every American can do is heed the guidance and the direction from your state and local officials, particularly in areas where we have widespread coronavirus infections.
But for every American, putting into practice these measures that the President alluded to at the very beginning of his remarks is a way that we can — that we can do this, America; that we can — we can lessen the magnitude of the coronavirus in our country.  With the cooperation, compassion, generosity, and prayers of the American people, we can slow the spread, we can protect the most vulnerable, and we can heal our land.
So let’s do it, America.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Mike.
So, just a couple of little things, and we’ll take some questions.  Maybe you will have some, maybe you won’t.  That’ll be a shock.  It would shock the American public.
But I have to say, on the testing, the new — if we — if this works out, and we think it might, the new test will be a very simple one — much easier than the existing test, which is quite complex and not — not a lot of fun to take.  And this will be a game changer.
But remember: We inherited a broken, obsolete system.  It was good for a small number of people, but not good for the millions of people that we’re talking about.  And we’ve made this into a system that, no matter where you go in the world, that’s where they’re going, that’s what they want to do, that’s how they’re going to be doing it should something like this happen again.
So our people have done a fantastic job.  Really, a fantastic job.  And I hope the new test works out.  We’ll know fairly soon, I think, Doctor.  We’re going to be knowing about that fairly soon.  Hopefully, it’ll check out or test out.  And we certainly are looking forward to that.  That will be a very simple test by comparison.  It won’t will be unpleasant at all.
And one other thing: the ships.  So we have the Mercy, and that’s in — it’s going to California, as you know.  That’s in — on the West Coast now.  And you have a sister ship that’s essentially a twin.  They’re incredible.  I mean, they’re incredible ships.
I’ve seen it.  I’ve seen one of them, and they are unbelievable — what they can do and the capacity.  Many operating rooms.  You know, they’re wartime ships.  They’re meant for war.  Many, many operating rooms.  Stainless steel.  These rooms are as good as there is anywhere in the nation, actually.
I spoke with Governor Cuomo.  We had a great conversation today — a number of conversations, actually.  He’s working very hard.  And we are going to be bringing that ship — that’s called the Comfort.  So you have the Mercy and the Comfort.  The Comfort is on the East Coast.  And that ship will be coming over the next three weeks — three or four weeks.  It’s being — it was in the middle of maintenance, and we are moving the maintenance very, very quickly.  And we’re also supplying the ship simultaneously.  It’s actually big supplies going into those ships — big.  And that ship will be coming up here over the next few weeks, and we’ll probably be putting it in New York Harbor.  And we’re making arrangements for that, also, as to where it’s going to be docked.
So you have the Mercy and you have the Comfort.  They’ll be coming up.  The Mercy will start very — very quickly.  It’ll be arriving in Los Angeles pretty soon.  So we look forward to that.
A question?  ABC, go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-8/

1:00 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much.  A lot of things going on, and we’re going to be going over to the Hill, and we’re having a lot of meetings.  And, from the financial — this is a medical situation, not a financial situation.  The financial, though, is moving along very nicely.
I want to thank you for being here and update you on the progress we’ve made after a week of extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus.  Governors, mayors, the businesses, charities, and citizens are all working with urgency and speed toward one common goal, which is saving American lives.
We’re in communication with foreign countries.  It’s now at 148 foreign countries.  Can you believe that?  One hundred — you talk about a spread.  You talk about a violent spread.  One hundred and forty-eight countries.  Not even believable.
This has been a week of national action and of great national solidarity.  People are getting along.  We’re getting along with Republicans and Democrats and independents and liberals and conservatives.  And actually, it’s a very nice thing to see.  We’re all one beautiful, big American family, and that’s taking place right now.
Last night, I proved a major disaster declaration for the State of New York.  I worked very closely with Governor Cuomo.  And is the first time in our nation’s history that a President has used the Stafford Act to declare a major disaster in response to a public health crisis.  Never happened before.  I’m considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that.  And I’m working very closely with Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, and others; we may be doing the same thing, depending on their needs, depending on what they’re asking for.
It’s been unprecedented action in New York, and we’ve had a tremendous federal response all over the country.  And I want to thank all the people in the federal government and obviously in the state governments and local governments.  We are working hard.  Everybody is working hard.  And the people standing alongside of me are working very hard, that I can tell you.
We’ve also reached agreements with Canada and Mexico on new travel rules at our northern and southern borders to halt the entry of the Chinese virus while continuing trade and commerce.  And we’ve had very good talks, I’ve — with Prime Minister Trudeau, and today, this morning, with President López Obrador.  And we talked about joint measures that we’re taken to prevent the spread of the virus in our countries and to temporarily suspend nonessential travel.   We had a great conversation this morning — the President of Mexico.  And our close cooperation with Mexico and Canada will keep our people healthy, keep their people healthy, keep everybody safe.
Yesterday, I had a call with 12,000 small businesses — representatives of these businesses.  That’s the engine of our country.  People don’t realize that.  You know, you read all about the big ones, but the — these small businesses, when you add them up together, are really the engine — economic engine of our country.  And I assured them that my administration is doing everything within its very considerable — considerable power, frankly, to support them and their employees.
Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.  Likewise, I had calls during the week with all sorts of representatives and systems, like the hospital system.  We spoke to many of the hospital systems throughout the country — nurses and doctors, representatives representing hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors; airlines and cruise ship companies.
The business roundtable, which was fully attended and it’s all of the top CEOs of our country and beyond, frankly — the businessmen of — really, these a world — world-styled businessmen.  These are businessmen that control the biggest companies in the world.  Many of them have taken hits, and many of them are just, you know, going forward.  They — their businesses have been — have been great.  Some have been very badly affected, some haven’t been affected at all, and, frankly, some are doing very well.  They continue to do very well.
It’s — Walmart, as an example, has been really helpful to us.  Doug McMillon, the head of Walmart — really helpful to us.  And I guess — I assume they’re doing pretty well because people are certainly buying — buying more than even a clip at Christmas, by substantial numbers.  Pretty amazing.  But they’re doing incredibly.  They put on tremendous extra staff.  You don’t have empty shelves.  A lot of things have happened that are very good.
Restaurants, fast food executives, grocery stores, all retailers — literally, all of them — in groups.
And we spoke with the G7 leaders at length, as you know.  You probably know about that.
Spoke to many of the governors.  Spoke almost all of the governors at conference calls and many of the governors individually.
And, very importantly, the religious leaders.  We had a great conversation yesterday — the Vice President and myself — with the religious leaders of — of our country.  Many of the religious leaders.  And we’ve had a number of them, during the course of the last two weeks, actually.  But yesterday, we had a very, very significant call with the religious leaders of our country.
I signed legislation providing American workers with paid sick leave and paid family medical leave at no cost to employers and free testing for those who need it.  The testing is going very well and the Admiral will speak to that, along with Tony.
We’re working quickly to pass additional legislation that will provide massive relief to small businesses and affected industries and give direct payments to our great workers and hardworking American families.  There’s never been anything like we’re doing on the Hill right now.  They’re negotiating — Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer.  They’re all up there — Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi.  They’re all negotiating and everybody is working hard and they want to get to a solution that’s the right solution.  I think we’re getting very close.
We’ve also announced that we’ve moved Tax Day from April 15 to July 15, which is a big deal, giving businesses and individuals extra time to file and pay without interest or penalty.  So we’ve moved the date way back.  And so it’ll be July 15, instead of your traditional April 15.  And, very importantly, you will have a lot of time, but you’re not going to have interest penalties or any kind of penalties by filing at that later date.
HUD announced that foreclosures and evictions are suspended for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days.  And our great head of HUD, who’s with us today, Ben Carson, is going to say a few words in a moment.
The Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing — which is another big deal — requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current school year.  Not fair to do that, so we are waiving that.  I would imagine it’s probably the first time ever that has been waived, but I think it’s only fair to the students and to the parents of the students.
It is also waiving interest and other things that we’re discussing right now on federally held student loans and directed that borrowers be allowed to suspend their student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days.  And we’ll be talking about student loans; going to help the students.  They’re under a great burden right now, so we will be talking about that further.  But we’re — we’re waiving, during this 60-day period, various elements — very important elements — on student loans.  Big subject.
I signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act, as you all know, giving us powerful new authorities to help states, cities, and hospitals procure needed supplies.  There’s been a clear call to action to the private sector, and the call is made right here.  It’s been really pretty amazing what’s happened with the private sector — they are really in sixth gear, I think — which has responded in full force, helping to produce and supply much-needed masks, swabs, sanitizers, ventilators, and everything else.  There’s a move on that’s incredible right now.
And, by way of example, Hanes — everybody knows Hanes; great company, great consumer cotton products company — is retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities in large sections of their plants to produce masks.  And they’re in that process right now.
And, at my direction, the FDA is taking rapid steps to make these items available for medical use right now.  Most excitingly to me is what the FDA has done in order to get, possibly, a very successful number — it’s not just one or two — number of therapeutics: medicines that can help — help people that are already sick, help people not get sick.  And, obviously, you know about the vaccine.  And Tony will discuss that a little bit later, but the vaccine is moving along.
But this is something that, right now — for right now, this is what we really — it’s incredible.  And what the FDA has done and Dr. Stephen Hahn, who is highly respected — came as a — just a highly respected man.  He’s been fantastic.  He’s only been here for a couple of months and he’s — he’s gotten thrown into the swim of it and he’s really standing up.
But the FDA has really moved mountains.  I said it this morning: They’ve moved mountains to get approvals on things that — that maybe work.  We’ll find out very soon.  It won’t take long.
An example of the Pernod Ricard, which is — this is really an example where we’re repurposing alcohol.  They went out and repurposed their alcohol production capabilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, Texas, and West Virginia to make hand sanitizer.  That’s a big difference.  And they’ve been unbelievable.  They really — Pernod Ricard.  Their first delivery will be on Tuesday.  It’s going to go to various states.  They’re going to start, I think, in New York and they’re going to work their way around.  They’re making a tremendous amount of hand sanitizer — at a very high level too, by the way.
We’ve activated the National Response Coordination Center to Level 1.  That’s your highest level.  This is the nerve center of all of our government response to crisis and it’s coordinating very closely with our nation’s governors.  Our nation’s governors — many of you were at the call yesterday with the governors and I think you can see the relationship.  And we’ve had numerous calls with governors, by the way, but the relationships are pretty amazing.  They like — they’re loving what we’re doing and the coordination between the federal government and the governors, states, and even local has been pretty incredible.
FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who is with us, will soon be providing you with an update on the Center’s operations.  And FEMA has been incredible.  We got them involved last week — very much involved — and now they’re involved nationwide.  We’ve dramatically expanded telehealth so Americans can see a doctor without leaving home — something which more and more people are using and now they’re really using it.  And now the ones that are using it are loving it.  And I think we’re going to change the way our country functions, medically and probably in other ways, because of what’s going on right now.  This will reduce the chance of infection and preserve hospital capacity.  So it solves a lot of problems.
Every American has a role to play in defending our nation from this invisible, horrible enemy.  It really is — it’s an invisible enemy.  And we will be successful — very successful — hopefully very much sooner than people would even think.
So we say, “Stay at home and save lives.”  This is a time of shared national sacrifice, but it’s also a time to treasure our loved ones and to take stock of what is most important: our faith, our families, our neighbors, and our great country.  And I want to thank all of the incredible people of our country, the citizens of our country that — what you’ve done and the way you’re responding has just been very special — something that we will never forget, that the history books will never forget.
And we’re going to have a great victory.  We’re going to be celebrating a great victory in the not-too-distant future.  And I just want to thank everybody.
And now I’ll introduce our Vice President, Mike Pence, who’s led the Task Force.  And I will tell you this: He has not slept much.  Maybe a tiny bit, maybe a little bit, but not much.  And he’s done an incredible job.
Mike, thank you.  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, all.  And thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today. We briefed the President on our latest recommendations.  We continue, at the President’s direction, to lead not a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-America approach.
You just heard the President describe one inspiring story after another of the way the American people are responding, the way American businesses are responding, and religious communities across this country.  The American people are coming together.  They’re responding with common sense, compassion, and generosity.
People are heeding the advice of state and local authorities, and tens of millions of Americans are putting into practice the “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  We are — we are officially, Mr. President, 6 days into our 15 days.  And as we look all across this country, while we — we strongly support the decisions that governors in states where we have significant outbreak have taken, we encourage every American to listen to those state and local authorities.
For every American, this is what you can do to make a difference over the next week and a few days to protect your health, protect your family’s health, but most especially slow the spread and the potential for the coronavirus to impact the most vulnerable.
As the President said, we’ve been — we’ve almost been overwhelmed at the outpouring of support from American businesses.  The President spoke yesterday to thousands of small businesses.  We spoke to manufacturers yesterday.  And, in fact, as President indicated, the FDA, in record time, just approved one manufacturer that will be producing millions of surgical masks in a matter of weeks for the American people.
The pastors we spoke to, we — we want to thank all the religious leaders from every community of faith in the country making the hard choice to suspend services, to have online services, even while those ministries are continuing to support food banks and come alongside the most vulnerable.  And, of course, the chorus of prayers that is coming up from communities of faith around the country is making the difference that it always has in the life of this nation.
One thing the President and I promised was to remind people that on the weekends that you’re not in the pews, it’s still a good — it’s still a good idea to — if you can, to go ahead and make that donation.  Because all the ministries are continuing to play a vital role in our communities and we encourage your continued support.
The President and I are grateful that the American people are listening to state and local authorities and putting into practice all of — all of the recommendations in the President’s coronavirus guidelines.
And, as you will hear in just a few moments from Admiral Giroir, testing is expanding rapidly across the United States of America.  State-run drive-throughs are expanding across the country.  And, as you will hear detailed this morning, now more than 195,000 Americans and more who have been symptomatic have been tested.  That number does not include county hospitals or healthcare labs around the nation, some 15,000 in number.
And among the number of the more than 195,000 that have been tested, it’s important to remember that only 19,343, at this moment, have tested positive for the coronavirus.  We want to — we continue to urge state and local health authorities to contact FEMA for all the latest developments and innovations in testing.  But we want to remind Americans, as Dr. Fauci will emphasize in a moment: If you don’t have symptoms, don’t do a test.  It is another way that the American people can make sure that we are preserving the resources that our healthcare workers need to minister and to support those who are dealing with the coronavirus and other illnesses.
In a moment, Pete Gaynor will detail the efforts at FEMA.  Since the President’s National Emergency Declaration, we have FEMA in the lead; stood up the National Response Coordination Center; as the President said; and we are working closely, literally hour by hour, through FEMA, processing requests from states most impacted, like New York, Washington State, and California, and we’ll continue to work very, very closely with those states through their very traditional means of federal emergency management at FEMA.
Secretary Carson will describe decisive actions the President alluded to, to bring foreclosure relief to Americans.  And, on the subject of supplies, in a moment, you will hear of not only the progress that we’re making on testing, but on Monday, we’ll be detailing for the American people the progress that we are making on the President’s strategy of procuring more personal protective equipment and medical supplies, allocating them through the system at FEMA, and continuing to urge conservation by Americans.
In fact, I’m pleased to report to the President today that HHS just placed a — an order for hundreds of millions of N-95 masks that will be being made available to healthcare providers across the country.
On behalf of the President, we do renew our call for Americans to postpone elective medical procedures, including dental services.  And remember, this is another way that you’re going to make sure that medical supplies are available, because, by postponing elective medical procedures, you’re freeing up medical supplies for those dealing with the coronavirus.
As the President mentioned, our team is on Capitol Hill as we speak, working with members of Congress in both political parties.  They’re making progress, by all accounts, on a bipartisan bill.  They worked late into the night last night and started early this morning, and we are working to pass that legislation on Monday in both the House and the Senate.
Now, on a personal note, many of you may have been made aware that a member of my staff has tested positive for the coronavirus.  We learned of that late yesterday.  I am pleased to report that he is doing well.  He had mild, cold-like symptoms for about a day and a half; has not been to the White House since Monday.
Neither the President nor I had direct contact with that staff person.  We worked immediately with the White House physician and the CDC.  We’ve done all contact tracing.  And while the White House doctor has indicated that he has no reason to believe that I was exposed and no need to be tested, given the unique position that I have as Vice President and as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon.
Let me say again how grateful the President and I are that every American has acted on the President’s coronavirus guidelines.  We are 6 days into 15 days that, but as Dr. Fauci may well reflect in a moment, it’s an opportunity for us here on the footholds of this epidemic curve in our country to literally lower the impact in our nation and save lives.  Every American can do their part to slow the spread.  And we encourage you each to continue to do that.
As the President says often: Remember we’re all in this together.  And also remember that, for most Americans, the risk of serious illness from the coronavirus remains low.  The reason we want to put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines is because no American would want to inadvertently expose someone who is vulnerable — a senior with a serious underlying health condition — to the coronavirus with a potential threat.
I did hear one story this morning, Mr. President, about a senior named Geneva Wood.  She actually is at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington.  She is not only a grandmother, she is a great, great grandmother.  Ninety years young, and she tested positive for the coronavirus on March 6th.  But by all accounts, she’s doing well and she wanted America to know there is hope.  And her strength and her enthusiasm is truly an inspiration to the nation.
As the President said many times, we’re going to get through this and come out stronger than ever before.  And we’ll get through this as Americans, together.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike.
Admiral, please.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.
As I told you earlier last week, we are in the process and are effectively transitioning to large-scale testing by leveraging all the components of the American healthcare system.  When we started, it was CDC only, then it was the state public health laboratories.  Now we’re transitioning into the mainstream of American testing with many of the companies that the President invited in the Rose Garden just a week ago.
So, currently, 91 public health laboratories, state public health laboratories are up and running in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.
This is our curve, and I want to be very clear about this — that this only accounts for CDC state public health laboratories and the laboratories that are members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association.  These are the main reference laboratories: LabCorp, Quest, Mayo, ARUP, Bio-Reference Labs, and Sonic Healthcare.  It does not account for the well over 10,000 — 15,000 hospital-based labs, many of which are doing testing, for whom we will get data this week to give you an overall rollup.
As you can see, over 195,000 people in America have completed their testing.  That means tests plus results.  This does not count the people whose tests are in process.  And, as you see, this curve is going — it will continue to rise dramatically over the next period of time.
So, again, this is utilizing all the components of the great American healthcare system, the state and local public health laboratories, the hospital system, which is not represented here, and the main reference laboratories.
Now, I do want to make it clear that, although testing is becoming more available, and Dr. Fauci will definitely emphasize this more, there are priorities for testing.  And clearly, everyone across the country should understand that those hospitalized or in an ICU are our priority for testing:  Symptomatic health care workers, for obvious reasons, we want to make sure that they — their health is preserved and that they are not going to spread to those who may be seriously ill;
symptomatic people in long-term care facilities: As the Vice President has highlighted and we’ve said many times, elderly in our society have a much higher mortality rate, much higher serious complication rate; Symptomatic individuals over 65: Symptomatic individuals who have underlying conditions, like chronic heart disease or liver disease or other types of chronic diseases; Patients in public health investigations.  And there are local priorities around the country, particularly healthcare workers for testing.
And Dr. Fauci is going to emphasize this about the types of people who may not need to be tested.  Testing is going well, it’s ramping up, but we should still have priorities.
Finally, I want to talk about the community-based testing sites.  I know they’re popular now because there’s now an acronym, which I’m sure the Vice President doesn’t appreciate: CBTS or CBT sites.  We talked about these earlier in the week and I wanted to emphasize, again, that these are state-managed and locally executed.  The federal government is there to provide support, know how, blueprints on how to do this, but these are really springing up at dozens and dozens of sites all over the country, adapted to the local needs.  Some are drive-throughs, some are walk-up, some are geared to healthcare workers and emergency responders.
So again, what we see in the upcoming week is this curve will continue to increase as testing becomes more widely available, as the great American healthcare industry continues to increase the availability of tests and the throughput of those tests.
Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Admiral.  Dr. Fauci, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, President, Mr. Vice President.  What I want to do, just over the next minute or so, is maybe connect some of the dots of the things that you’ve heard today.
First, the status of the dynamics of the — of the outbreak.  I mean, you all know the numbers.  You’ve seen them.  We have widespread infection, but to varying degrees throughout the country.
So, for example, when you talk about the kinds of mitigation issues that we have put forth and have emphasized, just as I mentioned the other day, there are two dynamic forces that are going on at the same time.  You’re having the natural course of an outbreak, trying to peak at a high level.  And then you have the mitigation strategies, which are aimed at dampening that.  We’ve mentioned that multiple times.
We often get asked: “How do you know you’re having an effect?”  Because there are two things that are going on at the same time, they may be confounding.  Well, I can tell you for sure, from a public health standpoint and experience with other outbreaks, we know we are clearly having an effect, but we can’t  quantitate it for you accurately now, because, looking forward, you’ll know what the impact of the rate of this steep inclines will be.  So that’s why we’re going to come back to you every day and keep you up to date about that.
Getting — with regard to the disproportionate of the response, everyone — it’s right here.  I’ll get the — open up the Vice President’s book, with his permission.  This is baseline for everyone — in other words, throughout the country.  But then there will be areas — and you’ve heard them: Washington State, California, New York City — in which the dynamics of the outbreak are clearly different and much more robust, if you want to use that word.  And that’s the reason why we’re seeing the mitigation ratcheted up in that regard.  And again, hopefully — and I have confidence it will happen — you will see an impact on that.
Next, getting to testing.  You saw the numbers we’re testing.  Remember, there was always an issue with testing.  I think we’re getting to the solution that everybody in the country is looking for.
But I want to emphasize one thing that Admiral Giroir mentioned — is that not every single person in the United States needs to get tested.  He gave you the priorities; I don’t want to repeat them.  But let me tell you one of the unintended consequences of individuals who don’t need to get tested that flood the desire to get tested.  Currently — and I hope we’ll be able to change it and make it much less reliable on PPEs — when you go in and get tested, you are consuming personal protective equipment — masks and gowns.  Those are high priority for the healthcare workers who are taking care of people who have coronavirus disease.
So what we don’t want to do is to have a situation where we will — we do have disparities in availability of PPEs now and we’re working hard to correct that.  But currently today, we want to make sure that the people who are taking care of people with coronavirus disease do not endanger themselves because they don’t have the personal protective equipment.
And then finally, one last thing — it was just mentioned.  The Surgeon General has been pushing this: Please put off, cancel elective medical and surgical procedures.  You don’t want to not ever do them, but, for the time being, don’t do them because they also not only consume personal protective equipment, they may also consume some of the things like ventilators that you might need.  So let’s pull in this together, and we will get through it, I promise you.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony, very much.  Please.
ADMINISTRATOR GAYNOR:  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  FEMA is now leading the federal operation — or the federal response for all operations on behalf of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, who oversees this whole-of-nation response.
HHS will continue to provide their expert — matter expertise on health.  Pursuant to the nationwide emergency declaration, FEMA, in coordination with HHS, is assisting state, local, tribal, territorial governments and other eligible entities with health and safety emergency protective measures on behalf of the American public.
As of yesterday, 50 states, the District of Columbia, 5 territories, and 1 tribe are working directly with FEMA under the nationwide emergency declaration for COVID-19.  In just 24 hours, we’ve obligated $100 million to states, territories and tribes.
A little bit about supplies: It is of the utmost importance that requests for assistance, especially for critical supplies, get routed through proper channels as soon as possible.  And we ask everyone to follow the normal procedures — the normal procedures FEMA uses in a natural disaster.  There’s no different procedure for the COVID-19 pandemic.
But, remember, you can still order supplies from your regular vendors and buy it on the open market.  Buy it where you can find it.  We will reimburse you.  If you buy medical supplies from foreign sources, it is reimbursable.  “Buy America” does not apply to the Stafford Act, except for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.
If you can’t buy it on the open market, make a request to the FEMA system.  Requests for assistance at the local and county level should first go to states — from states to the regional FEMA offices, and then from those offices right here in D.C., where the National Response Coordination Center is open and running.
We are getting requests for mass PPE swab sets, test site supports, ventilators, hospital-capacity assessments and many more.  And we are in lockstep with HHS to answer these requests, but we will do whatever is necessary to get states, tribes, territories, and others, what they need.
And then, finally, what we are doing here in Washington, D.C. — again, this is a whole-of-government response.  Like all emergency responses, it’s most successful when it is locally executed, state-managed, and federally supported.  We can’t say that enough.
On Thursday, our federal partners fully integrated with our National Coordination — Response Coordination Center.  And, additionally, all 10 FEMA regions across the country have been activated.
The FEMA regional administrators will continue to coordinate closely with governors, state emergency managers, state public health officials to determine the type and level of support needed to respond to this dynamic threat.  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Pete.  Appreciate it.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Ben?
THE PRESIDENT:  Ben, please.
SECRETARY CARSON:  Well, thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for your tireless leadership here.  And I also want to thank the fellow Task Force members who have been working around the clock in a very patriotic way to serve their fellow Americans.
You know, part of the American Dream is having a home.  And sometimes people say, “Well, what does housing have to do with health?”  It has everything to do with health, having a safe home.  And that is the reason that the President has authorized the immediate cessation of foreclosure and eviction proceedings for American citizens, single-family forward mortgages, as well as reverse mortgages.  And, as you know, FHFA has also decided to do the same thing for 60 days, and the CFPB is very happy with all of this as well.
And it’s really all about helping our people, recognizing that they’re being severely impacted by the coronavirus.  And we’ve also asked the various servicers of mortgage loans to exercise forbearance for anybody who is having difficulty.  It is important, if you’re having difficulty, to actually contact the people who have made the loan, who established the mortgage because it doesn’t happen automatically.  What does happen automatically is that we cover all 8.5 million people, in terms of the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions.
We want also for the PHAs to protected.  HUD does not have authority to mandate that evictions can’t occur, but we are in contact with all the PHAs across the country, and are petitioning Congress for the power to be able to actually enforce that.  But the fact of the matter is, most of the PHAs are run by people who actually care about other people, so we really haven’t seen much of a problem there.  We haven’t seen much of a problem with forbearance and needing to try to force people to do it because they want to do it.  People are stepping up and saying, “What we can do to be helpful?”
As far as Housing Choice vouchers — Section 8 — is concerned, the April vouchers will be sent out next week and May vouchers are already being worked on.  And we’re also staying in contact with all the stakeholders, the advocates for low-income housing, as well as other stakeholders to make sure that we’re doing things that are most helpful to them.
And additionally, we’ve extended the deadlines for healthcare and multifamily financial reporting requirements.  And that’s for over 20,000 multifamily and healthcare borrowers until April the 30th.  And that provides them with a lot more flexibility to deal with the issues that they’re dealing with.
I also want to thank our FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery; as well as the FHFA Director, Mark Calabria; and Kathy Kraninger, the Director of the CFPB, who’ve all worked tirelessly with us to make this happen.
What we’re trying to do is bridge the gap, recognizing that it’s a lot easier for us to take these measures and for Congress to take the measures that they’re taking so that we don’t destroy a very excellent system and have to start all over again.
So for those who are worried about the money that’s being spent, if you don’t spend the money and deal with this now, it’s going to cost a whole lot more to try to build all this up again.
And, as was mentioned by the President, there’s been a sense of unity that we haven’t seen for a long time in this country, and let’s hope and pray that that unity lasts far beyond this crisis.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well said.
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Ben, thank you very much.  A few questions, please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-7/

11:50 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I had a very good telephone conversation — extremely good — with Senator Schumer a little while ago.  We’re working on various elements of the deal, and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen, and the Republicans, likewise, are very much wanting something to happen.  And I think it will.
I spoke with — at length with Mitch McConnell.  And there’s tremendous spirit to get something done, so we’ll see what happens.  But my conversation was very good with Senator Schumer.
I thank you all for joining us, and I’d like to begin by providing an update on what we are doing to minimize the impact of the Chinese virus on our nation’s students.
With many schools closed due to the virus, the Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing requirements, very importantly, for students in elementary through high school for the current year.  They’ve been through a lot.  They’ve been going back and forth; schools open, schools not open.  It’s been all standardized testing.  And, you know, it’s — we’re not going to be enforcing that, so I think you can let people know.  I think probably a lot of the students will be extremely happy; some probably not.  The ones that work hard, maybe not.  But it’s one of those things.  Unfortunate — very unfortunate circumstance.
We’ve also temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans.  They’ll be very happy to hear that.  And I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately.  And today, Secretary DeVos has directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days.  And if we need more, we’ll extend that period of time.  Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instructions.
So we’ve temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans.  That’s a big thing.  That’s going to make a lot of students very happy.  And we have more to come on student loans — more good news for the students — but we’ll do that at a different time.
This morning, the Treasury Department also announced that we’re moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15.  So we’re moving it out to July 15th so that people will have time and people will be able to — hopefully, by that time, we’ll have people getting back to their lives.  Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties.  We’re getting rid of interest and penalties.
However, if you have refunds or credits you would like to claim, you may still file.  In other words, you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS.  Other than that, we’re moving it all the way out to July 15th — no interest, no penalties.  Your new date will be July 15.
Today, our team will also provide an update on our continuing effort to prevent the transmission of virus across America’s borders.  And I watched what’s been happening in California with Governor Newsom and, this morning, with Governor Cuomo, and I applaud them.  They’re taking very strong, bold steps, and I applaud them.  And we’re all working together.  We’re working very closely together, including those two governors.
But I would say, based on the call — the media was there — I think we can say that, with respect to virtually every governor on that call, I think every governor — we had almost all of them, if not all of them — and I would say that you could see for yourselves that the level of respect and esprit de corps working together was extraordinary.  There was nobody angry, nobody upset.  We’re able to help them, and that’s what we’re all about.  We want to help.
We’re doing things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do.  But the relationship with governors and states is, I think, very extraordinary, especially under the circumstances where this just came upon us.
We’re working with Canada and Mexico to prevent the spread of the virus across North America, very closely.  You heard what we did yesterday with Canada.  And Secretary of State Pompeo will be making a statement in a little while having to do with Mexico and the border.  And Chad likewise — Chad Wolf will likewise be making a statement.  This is a joint comprehensive effort in collaboration with our neighbors.
The measure and all of those measures that we’re putting in place will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for a mass global migration that would badly deplete the healthcare resources needed for our people.  And so we are working very closely with Mexico, very, very closely with Canada.  The relationship has never been better.  We’re all working for the same — toward the same goal.
Our nation’s top healthcare officials are extremely concerned about the grave public health consequences of mass uncontrolled cross-border movement.  And that would be mostly — and even beyond — but mostly during this global pandemic.
Every week, our border agents encounter thousands of unscreened, unvetted, and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries.  And we’ve had this problem for decades.  For decades.  You know the story.  But now it’s — with the national emergencies and all of the other things that we’ve declared, we can actually do something about it.  We’re taking a very strong hold of that.  And we have before, but this is now at a level that nobody has ever approached.
In normal times, these massive flows place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large.  Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our healthcare system, and severely damage our national security.  We’re not going to let that happen.
So we have a lot of information, and they’ll be discussing that in a moment.
To confront these public health degrees [dangers], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to exercise its authority under the Title 42 of the U.S. Code to give Customs and Border Protection the tools it needs to prevent the transmission of the virus coming through both the northern and the southern border.  So we’re treating the borders equally — the northern border and the southern border.  It’s being treated — they’re both being treated equally.  A lot of people say that they’re not treated equally.  Well, they are.
As we did with Canada, we’re also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel.  These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.  Furthermore, Mexico is taking action to secure our own southern border and suspend air travel from Europe.  So we’re coordinating very closely the air travel going to Mexico and then trying to come into the United States.
The actions we’re taking together with our North American partners will save countless lives.
At the conclusion of my remarks, Secretary Azar, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Wolf — we’re going to be also taking some questions with Tony and Deborah, who you’ve gotten to know very well — but they’ll be discussing certain things, and I think you’ll find them of great interest.  We’re going to be providing tremendous amounts of detail over the coming days, but a lot of it will be provided right now if you’d like to find out about it.
This has been a week of resolute action, tremendous action.  Tremendous relationships have developed with people that, frankly, didn’t get along.  People that didn’t like each other, they’re now working together and maybe, even in some cases, learning about each other and liking each other.  It’s a nice thing.
I invoked the Defense Production Act, and last night, we put it into gear.  We moved the National Response Coordination Center to the highest level of activist [sic].  I mean, if you — if you take a look at what we did, the level of activation has been increased to a grade one level, which is the highest level.
We’re providing historic support to small businesses and to the states.  The states need support.  Normally they do this themselves, but because of the magnitude of it, the federal government has gotten very much involved in terms of getting the equipment they need.  So we’re helping them.  It’s — it’s a responsibility they have, but we are helping the states a lot.  That’s why the governors, I think in every case, have been impressed and very nice.
We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers.  And I think it’s very important.  So they get paid sick leave at no cost to employers.
We’re accelerating the use of new drug treatments.  We’re advancing legislation to give direct payments to hardworking families.  Throughout our country, Americans from all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy striking our nation.  In times of struggle, we see the true greatness of the American character, and we are seeing that.  A lot of people are talking about it.
We’re at 141 countries, from what they’re telling me, and some of those countries are really working in a unified manner.  And they’re working very unified with us, almost — I could say a good — a good number of them.
Doctors and nurses are working nonstop to heal the sick.  Citizens and churches are delivering meals to the needy.  Truckers are making the long haul to keep shelves stocked.  We’ve been dealing with the big stores and the big chains, Walmart — they’ve been fantastic — and others.  They’ve all been fantastic.  We’ve made it much easier for them to stock.  In terms of travel and travel restrictions, we’re lifting restrictions so they can get their trucks on time.
You’re seeing very few empty shelves, and yet the amount of volume that they are doing is unprecedented because people want to have what they have to have, what they feel they have to have.  And they’re also buying in slightly smaller quantities, which is good — because we’re not going anywhere.  We’re going to be here.  So I want to thank all of those very great companies for working so well.
Americans from every walk of life are coming together.  And thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war, and we are.  We’re winning and we’re going to win this war.  America will triumph and America will rise higher than ever before.  We’ll be stronger than ever before, and we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot.  We’ve learned a lot about relying on other countries, and I can say that I think in both a very good and a very bad way.  Some good things came out of it and some not so good things came out of it.
So I’d like to move now to invite our team to provide information on the new measures to prevent viral spread at our borders.  And I’ll start by asking Secretary of State Pompeo to speak.  He’s doing a fantastic job.  And like everyone else, he’s been working very, very long and very, very hard.  And he’s doing the other more normal jobs of a great Secretary of State, but he got — he got tied into this like everybody else, and he’s been really doing a fantastic job.
Mike, please.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Mr.  President.  Before I address the efforts that we’ve been engaged in to push back against the Chinese virus, I want to assure the American people that, as President Trump just said, your State Department, your entire national security team is staying focused on the other diplomatic challenges around the world.  Those include reducing risk to America from Afghanistan, holding the Iranian regime accountable for its malign activity.  And our counterterrorism efforts against ISIS remain a priority for our team.
Our number one priority across those mission sets remains the protection of the American people.  The President and our team are very focused on it.
I’ll take this moment, too, to thank my team, the State Department team, who is working long hours all around the world to take care of Americans who are stuck at places around the world.  I’ll talk about that more in just a minute.  You’ve all seen Dr. Birx with me.  State Department officials are doing great work, but I want to — I want to give a shout-out to all of the State Department team, here in Washington and around the world, that are working overtime to help us push back against this pandemic.
Under the President’s leadership this week, we’ve taken two important steps.  First, as President Trump announced on Wednesday, the United States and Canada jointly agreed to restrict all non-essential traffic across our border.  This decision goes into effect tonight at midnight.  The restrictions will be reviewed after 30 days, and they exclude traffic and movement across the border for work or other essential reasons.  We’re grateful to have such an outstanding friend to the north who is committed, as we are, to defeating this virus.
I also want to announce today that the United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel across our shared border.  Both our countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus to ensure that commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing.  Here, too, the United States is glad to have a friend who is working side by side us in the fight.  Secretary Wolf will talk a little bit more about the details of how we’re working alongside our partner in Mexico to keep our southern border safe and secure as well.
On another note, yesterday the State Department issued a Level 4 global travel advisory.  This means that all international travel from U.S. citizens should be avoided.  In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who reside in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States unless they’re prepared to remain abroad for an extended time.  If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may well be severely disrupted.
And finally, I want to talk about the disinformation that people are seeing both on Twitter and around the world — some of it coming from government, some of it coming from other individuals.  I just urge everyone, as they’re seeing information — information that at one time suggested somehow this virus emanated from the United States Army, this information about lockdowns that are taking place: Every American indeed, and people all around the world, should ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong.
This is a tough fight.  The American people are tougher.  Our diplomatic teams are working around the clock to help them keep safe both home and abroad.  And we’re showing, once again, the global leadership that America has always delivered.  It’s been great to see countries around the world rally behind what President Trump and our team are doing.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you very much.  And we’ll take questions right after this.
Chad Wolf, please.
ACTING SECRETARY WOLF:  Well, let me start off by thanking the President and the Vice President for their continued leadership and commitment for protecting the American people during this crisis.
Early on, the President, again, took unprecedented actions to restrict travel from areas affected with the coronavirus.  And today, DHS has screened over 200,000 individuals coming back from those affected countries.  This has been an immense undertaking but one that the men and women of DHS have successfully accomplished.
Today’s announcement is yet another example of the extraordinary steps the administration is taking to ensure the safety of the American public.  Before I comment on the CDC order that I’m sure Secretary Azar will later elaborate on, let me first address the progress as Secretary Pompeo and others have made with our Canadian and Mexican partners regarding cross-border travel.
As we continue to evaluate common-sense measures that reduce risk and prevent further spread, it only makes sense that we have looked at the measures that our neighbors to the north and south are undertaking.  And so we’ve been working closely with those partners since the earliest days of this virus and the outbreak.  And again, as the President said earlier this week and Secretary Pompeo, we’ve reached an agreement — an agreement with both Canada and Mexico to limit non-essential travel across our land borders.
Let me be clear that neither of these agreements with Canada or Mexico applies to lawful trade or commerce.  Essential commercial activities will not be impacted.  We will continue to maintain a strong and secure economic supply chain across our borders.
A few examples of essential travel include but certainly are not limited to: individuals traveling for medical purposes, to attend educational institutions, for emergency response, public health services, and individuals engaged in lawful cross-border trade.  As the Secretary said, the agreements with both Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday, March 21st.
Furthermore, we’re also working collaboratively with Canada and Mexico to take decisive joint action regarding individuals seeking entry between our ports of entry.  The CDC order directs the Department to suspend the introduction of all individuals seeking to enter the U.S. without proper travel documentation.  That’s for both the northern and southern border.
The CDC Director has determined that the introduction and spread of the coronavirus and the Department’s Border Patrol stations and detention facilities presents a serious danger to migrants, our frontline agents and officers, and the American people.
So it’s important to note that the Department currently apprehends foreign nationals from over 120 different countries around the world — the vast majority of those having coronavirus cases.  Many of these individuals arrive with little or no identity, travel, or medical documentation, making public health risk determinations all but impossible.
It’s also important to note that the outbreak on our southern border would likely increase the strain on health systems in our border communities, taking away important and lifesaving resources from American citizens.
Tonight — again, at midnight — we will execute the CDC order by immediately returning individuals arriving without documentation to Canada, Mexico, as well as a number of other countries without delay.  So, again, CBP is positioned to execute these measures as we continue to keep our borders secure and safe.
Before I conclude, let me just wrap up by thanking the brave men and women of DHS, specifically CBP, and across the government for the work that they do day in and day out to keep the American people safe from the coronavirus.  The Department has a number of frontline officers that have been — have tested positive, as well as the others who are self-quarantining.  And I am doing everything that I can to protect these patriots as they continue to defend our homeland during this crisis.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Chad.  Really good.  Thank you.  Please, Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Today’s announcement is just the latest in a long line of bold, decisive actions the President has taken to protect Americans from the coronavirus spreading across our borders.
In January, within two weeks of China’s notifying WHO about the virus and with only 45 cases in China, we began screening travelers from Wuhan.  Then, over time, as the outbreak evolved, the President restricted travel from China, Iran, and Europe.  Our health experts say that these measures have been truly effective at slowing the virus’s spread to our shores.
Just think about this: Italy and the United States both saw their first travel-related case of coronavirus around the exact same time, the last week of January.  And yet, we have had precious time to continue our work around vaccines, therapeutics, and other preparations, while Italy has tragically been overwhelmed with critical patients for several weeks now.
The President today is taking action to slow the spread of infectious disease via our border.  Under Section 362 of the Public Health Service Act, the CDC is suspending the entry of certain persons into the United States because of the public health threat that their entry into the United States represents.
This order applies to persons coming from Mexico and Canada who are seeking to enter the country illegally and who would normally be held in a congregate setting like a Customs and Border Protection station.  It does not apply to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
During this pandemic, a number of health challenges arise when illegal immigrants arrive at our northern and southern borders and are taken into immigration custody.  We’re talking about significant numbers of illegal immigrants.  From this past October through February, DHS has processed more than 21,000 inadmissible aliens at the northern border and more than 151,000 inadmissible aliens at the southern border.
CBP facilities were never designed to hold large numbers of people and to protect agents and migrants from infection during a pandemic, nor to treat them for a novel virus if large numbers are infected.  When held at border facilities, these migrants risk spreading the virus to other migrants, to CBP agents and border healthcare workers, and even the United States population as a whole.  In such circumstances, the kind of social distancing measures the CDC and the President have recommended are simply not possible.
On top of that, any resources that we are using to reduce the risk of infection among CBP agents, healthcare workers, and migrants in these facilities are drawing on American — an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic.
That’s why the President and his administration are taking these important steps to keep Americans and our immigration system safe from these health risks as part of our whole-of-government approach to combatting the coronavirus.
Thank you, Mr. President, for the work that you’ve been doing throughout this crisis to slow the spread of the coronavirus and to keep our country safe.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  If I could ask Tony or Deb, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  So we continue to review the data very carefully from around the globe, as I know many of you are.  We continue to see signs that, again, individuals under 20 — 19 and under — may have severe disease, but majority and all have recovered to date.  We still see that same trend.
And, frankly, from Italy, we’re seeing another concerning trend: that the mortality in males seems to be twice in every age group of females.  This should alert all of us to continue our vigilance to protect our Americans that are in nursing homes.
This requires all of the community.  And when you see the sacrifices that many Americans have made — the sacrifices that the service industry has made to close their restaurants, close their bars, and so that the spread is discontinued — and then you really understand how all of Americans must make the same sacrifice.
We continue to ask you to follow the presidential guidelines of no groups coming together of more than 10; that, if anyone in the household is sick, that everyone quarantines in the household together; and that we continue to focus on those who have the most vulnerability to this illness.
Now, to the moms and dads out there that have children with immunodeficiencies or other medical conditions: We don’t know the level of risk.  And I know you will also protect them in the same way.  There just is not enough numbers at this time to really tell them if they’re at additional risk or not in the same way that adults are.
I don’t have any new data.  I can see the look on your face as saying, “Is she seeing something new?”  I don’t have any new data, but I think it’s important for us to be as honest with the American people as we can.  And when we don’t have data, be very clear that we don’t know.
Finally, no one is immune.  I sometimes hear people on radio or others talking about, “I’m immune to the virus.”  We don’t know if the contagion levels are difference in age groups, but we know it’s highly contagious to everyone.
Do not interpret mild or moderate disease as lack of contagion, or that you’re immune.  You just happen to have a better immune system and the ability to fight the virus in a way that maybe older people or people with existing medical conditions can’t.
And that’s why it’s very important at this moment, that all of you carry that message about the sacrifices that many have made, particularly our service providers and our frontline healthcare workers.  They are making that sacrifice every day so that every American can move through this well.  But we need every American following the presidential guidelines.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Tony, please.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I just want to underscore a couple of things that I’ve said a few times to this group.  You may recall that just a week ago or so I said the two pillars, the two elements of our capability to contain the infection and the surge of infections in this country rely on two things: keeping infections from coming from without in.  We’ve been very successful in doing that with China and with Europe.  Now we have the northern and southern border issues.  There’s a fundamental public health reason for doing that, because we cannot be preventing people from coming in from one area when they can actually go into the other.  So that’s an important reason.  Understand that there’s a public health reason for doing that.
The second thing — and I think it’s really important — is what happened in New York today, where Governor Cuomo mentioned about an hour ago some rather strong issues that have been addressed with his recommendations — not recommendations; essentially, orders.
Now, we have a group of recommendations and guidelines that are applicable to the entire country.  You know them; we’ve been over them.  Yet there are places, regions, states, cities in this country that are being stressed much, much more than the country as a whole.  Clearly, one of them was Washington; another one was California.  Governor Newsom made some very important, difficult decisions.  Today, Governor Cuomo did the same thing.  And I want to say I strongly support what he’s doing.
And one thing, as a New Yorker myself — for those of you who haven’t figured out from my accent that I’m from New York — as a New Yorker, I know what New Yorkers can do.  We’re tough.  I was in New York City on September 11, 2001, and I know what the New Yorkers can do.  So please cooperate with your governor, cooperate with your mayor.  It’s very important.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Tony.  Mike?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning and we continue, at the President’s direction, to bring the full resources, not just of the federal government, but in full partnership with our state governments, businesses around America, and a partnership with the American people to respond to the threat of the coronavirus.
And I know I can speak on behalf of the President with confidence when I say how inspired we are by the way the American people and American businesses are coming together to help defeat this virus in our country.  Millions of Americans are putting into practice the President’s 15-day guidelines, and we encourage everyone, even those that are not in areas with significant outbreak, to review these guidelines over the next week and more, and put them into practice.  And you’ll continue to do your part.
Later today, we’ll be talking with manufacturers around the country.  And the President I continue to be inspired by the way American industry is stepping forward.  We have businesses around the country that are literally volunteering to retrofit plants to help us meet the needs of our healthcare workers and our healthcare system in confronting the coronavirus.
As the President mentioned yesterday, following his decision to put FEMA in the lead — the emergency declaration — we actually met with all the nation’s governors from the FEMA National Response Coordination Center.  The President and I, our entire team at the federal level, couldn’t be more grateful for the efforts of all of our governors in implementing the guidance that is being issued not only from our task force, but also in taking strong measures in their own communities to protect their citizens.
We want to urge every American to heed your local authorities.  Listen to their guidance.  And also do your part to slow the spread.
We reiterated to all of the governors that the President, by putting FEMA in the lead, will continue to implement a plan that is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported that puts the health of America first.
We have received a report today, as the President mentioned, on our legislative team on Capitol Hill.  We’re working with Republicans and Democrats at this very hour to pass an economic recovery package that the President described.  And we hope to see the Congress act on that early next week.
On the subject of supplies, we continue to make steady progress on testing.  Thanks to the President’s involvement of commercial labs, the public and private partnership, more and more Americans are being tested every single day.
And tomorrow, Admiral Giroir and FEMA will update the American public on the status of testing and our support of state-based testing efforts that are literally expanding by the hour.
On the subject of medical supplies, we continue, at the President’s direction, to pursue every means to expand the supply of personal protective equipment for the extraordinary and courageous healthcare workers that are ministering to the needs of people impacted by the coronavirus.  We have a policy of procuring, allocating, as well as conserving the resources that we have in our system.
And now that the President worked with the Congress to make industrial masks fully available for hospitals to be able to purchase, to be able to use as protective equipment, we’re more encouraged than ever about the availability of those important N95 masks to our healthcare facilities.
And over this weekend, we’ll be announcing a major procurement from the federal government of N95 masks, as well.
We’re also encouraged that we’re finding new alternatives to increase the supply of ventilators.  We’ve mentioned that we have a federal stockpile, some 20,000 ventilators on standby, but that doesn’t count the tens of thousands of ventilators that are in our healthcare system around the country.
But the President has challenged us to work to free up other ventilators from other sources around the country.  And there are two different ways that we’re doing that.  Number one, in our recent discussion with anesthesiologists, we’ve literally identified tens of thousands of existing ventilators that can be retrofitted and converted to be ventilators for people struggling with the coronavirus.
But also, on the President’s behalf and on behalf of all of our task force, we want to continue to urge every American and every American hospital and healthcare facility to postpone any elective medical procedures.  This will free up bed space, free up hospital capacity for people that are struggling with the coronavirus, and it will also free up equipment that our healthcare workers need.
It is inspiring that we continue to receive reports that businesses around America are donating N95 masks to their local hospitals.  Businesses large and small are donating hundreds, in some cases millions, of N95 masks.  And I know — I know how grateful the President is and we all are.
And let me close by saying, as all of our experts have said many times, while the threat of serious illness to the average American from the coronavirus remains low, every American can do your part to reduce the burden on your health, on your family, the burden on our healthcare system and especially the threat to the most vulnerable among us by putting into practice the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”
And as the President said at the outset of his remarks, I know that millions of Americans are doing that just now.  And the greatness of the American character is shining forth.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you very much.
Okay, thank you.  Go ahead.  Kaitlan.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-c-oronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

11:31 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much.  I think this is going to be a very important conference and I’ll get to that toward the middle, but I have a few things to report.  And I want to thank you all for being here.
And I have to say, I think with social distancing that the media has been much nicer.  I don’t know what it is — all these empty — these in-between chairs.  We probably shouldn’t have anybody sitting behind you either.  You know, you should probably go back.  But I love it.  It’s so much nicer.  But I shouldn’t say that because you’ll get me now.
Thank you all for being here.  And we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus.  Before I begin, I want to start by announcing that today we are bringing home another American citizen.  It was a big thing.  Very big.  Amer Fakhoury is on his way back to the United States after being imprisoned in Lebanon since September of 2019.  He’s battling late-stage cancer.  Mr. Fakhoury will now be able to receive the much-needed care and treatment in the United States.  We’ve been working very hard to get him freed and he’s finally able to have his entire family at his side.
So I’m very grateful to the Lebanese government.  They worked with us.  And we are very proud of his family.  They stood by him so strongly, and they are thrilled.
The United States has no higher priority than the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.  We’ve gotten a tremendous number of hostages out, as you know.  I think we’re 42-and-0.  And Robert O’Brien, as you know, was our chief negotiator for a large part of it.  In fact, did so well that now we have him in a different position.
So I want to thank and congratulate Robert and his team and I want to let everyone know that recovering Americans held captive and imprisoned abroad continues to be a top priority for my administration.
We have one young gentleman, Austin Tice, and we’re working very hard with Syria to get him out.  We hope the Syrian government will do that.  We are counting on them to do that.  We’ve written a letter just recently, but he’s been there for a long time and was captured long ago.  Austin Tice.  His mother is probably watching and she’s a great lady.  And we’re doing the best we can.  So, Syria, please work with us.  And we would appreciate you letting him out.
If you think about what we’ve done, we’ve gotten rid of the ISIS caliphate in Syria.  We’ve done a lot for Syria.  We have to see if they’re going to do this.  So, it would be very much appreciated if they would let Austin Tice out immediately.
As you know, my administration is working every day to protect American people and the American economy from the virus.  Yesterday, I signed into law a critical support for American workers, families, and small businesses.  It was a big thing.  We’re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus and more help is on the way as we speak.
Our entire team, headed by Secretary Mnuchin, is on the Hill.  We’re working with Democrats and Republicans and there’s a lot of goodwill going on.  This was something that happened that was, some people would say, an act of God.  I don’t view it as an act of God; I would view it as is something that just surprised the whole world.  And if people would have known about it, it could have stopped — been stopped in place.  It could have been stopped right where it came from — China — if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it.
But now the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible — with this horrible virus and it’s too bad.  It’s too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago.
But we’ll be back and I actually think we’ll be back stronger than ever before because we learned a lot during this period of time.
I also just invoked the Defense Production Act to help facilitate distribution of essential supplies if necessary.  We’re working with Congress to provide major additional relief to the workers, small businesses, and the hardest-hit industries.  We want to make sure that everybody is able to continue on so that when we recover, all of these companies and these great businesses — both very, very small and very, very large — are not going to be broken up and you’d have to put them back together.  That would take a long time.
Because we really believe in — I believe in the V curve.  I believe it’s going to go.  When this is — when this is defeated — this hidden scourge is defeated — I think we’re going to go up very rapidly — our economy — and get back to where it was and beyond.
Today, I want to share with you exciting progress that the FDA is making with the private sector as we slash red tape like nobody has ever done it before.  Somebody was on yesterday, on one of the networks, and said that there’s never been a President even close that’s been able to do what I’ve done in slashing all of the red tape and everything to get very important things to the market — medical.
So we slashed red tape to develop vaccines and therapies as fast as it can possibly be done — long before anybody else was even thinking about doing this.  And, as you know, earlier this week, we began the first clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for the virus, and that was launched in record time.  It was just a few weeks.  And that would have taken years to do, not so long ago.
As we race to develop a vaccine, we’re also pursuing antiviral therapies.  And that’s what, really, we’re going to be talking to you about today.  That’s the purpose of being up here today.  And, to me, that’s even more important.  The vaccine, by its nature, you have to have long tests because you have to make sure what goes into somebody’s body is not going to do destruction, do bad things.  So you need long tests.
And they’re doing great with the vaccines, but it’s still a long process.  But the therapies are something we can move on much faster, potentially, and the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms — to make people better.  Essentially, we’re looking at things to make people better or, at the very earliest stages, they wouldn’t even know they had it.  And that’s where I believe it’s going to work even the best.
The FDA Commissioner — Stephen Hahn, who is with us — he’s fantastic.  And he has been working 24 hours a day.  He’s been — he’s worked like, probably as hard or harder than anybody in this — in the group, other than maybe Mike Pence or me.  And what the FDA is doing is incredible.  They’ve done things in times that were not even thinkable and I’ve directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and, I mean, fast.
And we have to remove every barrier.  There are a lot of barriers that were unnecessary.  And they’ve done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments.  And we think we have some good answers.  We’ll find out very, very soon.
Clinical trials are already underway for many new therapies and we’re working on scaling these to allow many more Americans to access different drugs that have shown really good promise.  We’ve had some un- — really good promise.  We will do so in a way that lets us continue to collect good data, to know which medicines are safe and which medicines are working the best.  We have a couple that we’re — we’re in really good shape on.  And that’s for immediate delivery — immediate — like as fast as we can get it.
The FDA has also approved compassionate use for a significant number of patients.  You know what that means.  We’re also reviewing drugs that are approved abroad or drugs approved here for other uses.
And, you know, one of the things that I’m most proud of that I got was Right to Try.  That’s where somebody who’s ill, somebody who’s very sick — terminally ill, usually.  In past administrations — we signed this a year and a half ago — you wouldn’t be able to even think about getting any of the drugs that may be showing great promise.  Now — and they’ve been trying for many decades to get this approved and it sounds simple, but it’s not because there’s liability involved and lots of other things.  And I was able to get it approved, working with Congress.  Right to Try.
This is beyond Right to Try.  What we’re talking about today is beyond Right to Try.  Right to Try has been, by the way, a tremendous success.  People are living now that had no chance of living, where we take treatments that would — things that — that would have to go through years of a process.  And if somebody was terminally ill — and I would say, “Why wouldn’t they be able to try this?”  They’d go to Asia, they’d go to Europe, they’d go all over the world to try and find something.  Or some people, if they had no money, would go home to die.  They’d go home to die; they had no hope.
Right to Try has been an incredible success.  But this is beyond Right to Try.  If treatments known to be safe in Europe, Japan, or other nations are effective against the virus, we’ll use that information to protect the health and safety of American people.  Nothing will stand in our way as we pursue any avenue to find what best works against this horrible virus.
Now, a drug called chloroquine — and some people would add to it “hydroxy-.”  Hydroxychloroquine.  So chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.  Now, this is a common malaria drug.  It is also a drug used for strong arthritis.  If somebody has pretty serious arthritis, also uses this in a somewhat different form.  But it is known as a malaria drug, and it’s been around for a long time and it’s very powerful.  But the nice part is, it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it — if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.
When you go with a brand-new drug, you don’t know that that’s going to happen.  You have to see and you have to go — long test.  But this has been used in different forms — very powerful drug — in different forms.  And it’s shown very encouraging — very, very encouraging early results.  And we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.  And that’s where the FDA has been so great.  They — they’ve gone through the approval process; it’s been approved.  And they did it — they took it down from many, many months to immediate.  So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states.
I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it at great length last night, and he wants to be right on — on the — he wants to be first on line.  And so I think that’s a tremendous — there’s tremendous promise, based on the results and other tests.  There’s tremendous promise.  And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it’s — it was approved very, very quickly and it’s now approved, by prescription.  Individual states will handle it.  They can handle it.  Doctors will handle it.  And I think it’s going to be — I think it’s going to be great.
Then we’re quickly studying this drug, and while we’re continuing to study it — but the studying is going to be also done in — as it’s given out to large groups of people, perhaps in New York and other places.  We’ll study it there.
There are promising therapies produced by Gilead, and that’s remdesivir.  Remdesivir.  And that’s a drug used for other purposes that’s been out and has had very good results for other purposes, but it seems to have a very good result, having to do with this virus.  And that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA.
And I can’t tell you how much we appreciate what the FDA — these people are incredible patriots.  And the job that Stephen Hahn is doing — Dr. Hahn, who is one of the most respected doctors in the country, by the way, where we took him.  I said, “You sure you want to do this?”  Now, we didn’t know that this was going to be in the playlist, what happened here, but he really has stepped up to the plate, wherever you are.  Where is he?  You really have.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT:  I’d shake his hand, but I’m not supposed to do that.  I’d get in a lot of trouble if I did that.  But he’s been fantastic.  And I thank you, Doctor.  He’s going to speak right after I’m finished.
So, Regeneron, again, and — is some — is a company that’s done fantastically well, as I understand, with Ebola and some other things.  Great company.  And they’re looking at some very promising events also.  So you have remdesivir and you have chloroquine and hydro- — hydroxychloroquine.  So those are two that are out now, essentially approved for prescribed use.
And I think it’s going to be very exciting.  I think it could be a game changer and maybe not.  And maybe not.  But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer.  Very powerful.  They’re very powerful.
So I want every American to know that we’re doing everything we can.  And these actions are important next steps.  I mean, for the FDA to act the way they acted, with this kind of speed, is an incredible thing.  Normally, they would say, “Well, we could have it by next year” or “We could have it by — in two years from now.”  You understand.  This is the way — normally, it’s like years and years and years.  They had it immediately, based on the fact that it’s been used for other things — totally unrelated things.
We believe these therapeutics and others under evaluation right now will be able to provide relief to many Americans.  We really hope that’s going to be.  This could be a tremendous breakthrough.  Tremendous breakthrough.  And we will work toward a much-needed vaccine in the future, as I said.  And what we’re doing with the FDA is so exciting in so many other fields.  So many things are happening.  It’s a very exciting time for — for medicine.
And we appreciate that the American public has pulled together.  They’re really staying home.  And I think there’s tremendous spirit in this country right now, a spirit like a lot of people have not seen.  People have not seen anything like it for a long time.  And that means Democrat, Republican.  They’re pulling together.  I hope everything is going good on the Hill.  Maybe I shouldn’t say this until I check out what’s going on, because you never know.  But — but I think there’s a great spirit where the Democrats and the Republicans and everybody else, they’re getting together and they’re trying to get things done.
But most importantly, the American public has been incredible.  We took the best economy we’ve ever had and we said “Stop.  You can’t work.  You have to stay home.”  You know, there’s never been a case like this.  Normally, you pay a lot of money to get things going.  Here’s a case we’re paying a lot of money to stop things because we don’t want people to be together so that this virus doesn’t continue onward.  So there’s never been anything like this in history.  There’s never been a –nobody has ever seen anything like this.
But we’re doing the right thing.  We have to get rid — I mean, our big war is not a — it’s not a financial war.  It’s a war — it’s a medical war.  And we have to win this war.  It’s very important.
With that, I’d like to just introduce Dr. Stephen Hahn.  And he — again, I’d like to send back with Stephen our thanks to all of the people working in the FDA who are fantastic, talented people.  We appreciate it very much, everything you’ve done, especially the speed that you got these two elements, these two very important drugs passed.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Stephen.
DR. HAHN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to thank you for your leadership during this coronavirus outbreak, and thank you for the kind words about the FDA staff.
We have 10,000 scientists, doctors, and others, and more than that working around the clock to aid the American people in this fight against the coronavirus.  And those words are very much appreciated, sir.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
DR. HAHN:  So, before the President nominated me and I was confirmed as Commissioner for Food and Drugs, I was a cancer doctor.  And I’ve sat across from countless number of patients and had to talk to them about their diagnosis and their treatment.  And one thing that was really important is to provide hope.  I have great hope for how we’re going to come out of this situation.
What’s also important is not to provide false hope, but to provide hope.  And, as a doctor, that’s the way I come to this.  I’m speaking now to the American people as Commissioner of Food and Drugs, but that part of me has not left.  Just look at the way the American people have responded to our calls for mitigation, for social distancing.  The American people have great resiliency, and I’m so incredibly proud of how the American people have responded.
As the President mentioned, he asked us to be aggressive, to break down barriers to innovation, and to accelerate the development of lifesaving treatments.  And we’re doing that at the FDA.
The FDA is committed to continuing to provide regulatory flexibility and guidance, but let me make one thing clear: FDA’s responsibility to the American people is to ensure that products are safe and effective and that we are continuing to do that.
Our folks — and they’re tremendous professionals — are working day and night to do this.  You just can’t even imagine how much they’re working to provide this support for the American people and I thank them.
Since early January, long before the first domestic case, FDA began working in collaboration with CDC.  I also want to note that we stood up an incident command group and had been focused on the coronavirus since the very beginning of this public health emergency.  This is, in addition, an all-of-government and all-of-America approach and I’ll describe what I mean by that, in terms of the development of therapeutics.
An important part of that work is expanding the potential therapeutic options associated with coronavirus, and we’ve learned from our colleagues across the globe about this.  But I want to focus on one thing: I was a cancer researcher before all this, and one thing I know about this great country of ours is that we have unbelievable innovators.  We have people who, every day, it’s their job to develop treatments for all sorts of diseases.  We are incredibly blessed, as a country, to have this.
And as is true in any illness, these great American innovators — academia, private sector — they have engaged us about the best possible treatment options.  We are looking at everything that’s coming across our desks as possible treatment options for coronavirus, and we’re extremely encouraged by the interest and the promise that we’ve seen from these great American innovators.
Now, again, we need to look at it.  We need the data, we need the information to make the absolute best decisions for the American people.  But I want to assure you, we have over 17,000 people at FDA who are doing this every day.
We need — we need to make sure that these — this sea of new treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time.  As an example, we may have the right drug, but it may not be in the appropriate dosage form right now, and that may do more harm than good.  Those are the things that that’s our job to look at.  And that’s why it’s really important we have these dedicated professionals looking at these aspects of therapeutic development.
At the same time, we’re also working through different mechanisms to actually get drugs into the hands of providers and patients.
The President mentioned this, but one of the mechanisms is called compassionate use.  Let me just tell you about this.  If there’s an experimental drug that’s potentially available, a doctor could ask for that drug to be used in a patient.  We have criteria for that and very speedy approval for that.  The important thing about compassionate use — and that’s what the President meant, “This is even beyond Right to Try” — is that we get to collect the information about that.  Because one of the things that I’ll promise the American people is we will collect the data and then make the absolute right decisions based upon those data about the safety and efficacy of the treatments.
We are working expeditiously, and we are working to make sure that these products are as safe and effective as they possibly can be.  Let me tell you about a few things that we’re currently working on.  And this is a plan that was developed with many of the people at this table, our infectious disease experts on the task force.
In the short term, we’re looking at drugs that are already approved for other indications.  So they’re already approved, as the President said, for other diseases.  As an example, many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug, chloroquine, which is an anti-malarial drug.  It’s already approved, as the President said, for the treatment of malaria, as well as an arthritis condition.  That’s a drug that the President has directed us to take a closer look at, as to whether an expanded-use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients.  And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial — a large, pragmatic clinical trial — to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and — asked and answered.
Let me give you another example: There’s a cross-agency effort about something called convalescent plasma.  This is a pretty exciting area.  And again, this is something that we have given assistance to other countries with as this crisis has developed.  So FDA has been working for some time on this.  If you’ve been exposed to coronavirus and you’re better and you don’t have the virus in your blood, we could collect the blood. Now, this is a possible treatment; this is not a proven treatment — just want to emphasize that.  Collect the blood, concentrate that, and have the ability, once it’s pathogen-free — that is, virus-free — to be able to give that to other patients.  And the immunoglobulins — the immune response — could potentially provide a benefit to patients.
It’s another thing that we’re looking at.  Over the next couple weeks, we’ll have more information on that.  We’re really pushing hard to try to accelerate that.  That’s in the sort of more medium- and short-term.  And that’ll be a bridge to other therapies that will take us three to six months to develop.
And this is a continuous process.  There is no beginning and end to each of this.  This is — you know, we’re pushing this through.
The other great thing about the great innovators of America is some of them tell us it’s taken us years — years — to develop therapies.  They’re looking at pushing that to the months period of time.  And we’re trying to provide them the reg- — the regulatory flexibility, but, at same time, the scientific oversight to make sure that gets done in the best way possible for the American people.
The President mentioned that there is a vaccine trial currently being performed.  It’s a phase-one trial, so it’s the earliest study that gets done.  We expect that to take 12 months to get to completion — to actually a time where we could approve a vaccine.  But that’s — these are all things to bridge to the prevention part of this with a vaccine.  It’s exciting work.  And the President is right: This is record time for the development of a vaccine and impressive public-private partnership.
The FDA’s efforts to facilitate the development of these products are focused on ensuring timely access, while also meeting the agency’s world-respected gold standard, relying on strong data from clinical trials to determine if an experimental or an off-the-shelf drug that’s used for something else can safely and effectively treat patients.  We want to assure the American people that FDA is all hands on deck, as the President mentioned — these efforts — and continue to work with interested sponsors to help expedite the work.  We remain steadfast in helping to foster the development of safe and effective therapies for COVID-19.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you very much.
Mike?  Talk about the masks, maybe.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning.  And on this very first day of spring, we continue to make steady progress toward President Trump’s objective not only to marshal all the resources of the federal government, every state government, every local health official, but also to harness the power of the American private sector.  And activities over the last day reflect all of those priorities.
Yesterday, the President spoke with America’s top physicians and nurses and garnered helpful insights about how we can best serve those who are serving Americans that are dealing with the coronavirus.  We also had a productive call with over 5,000 state and local officials, explaining the federal government’s approach and our strong and seamless partnership with all 50 states and the territories.
Last night, as you heard, the President signed the Family First Coronavirus Response Act, which provides free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, family leave for caregivers, and food assistance for the needy, among a broad range of benefits.  And today, as the President indicated, we expect that the Senate will begin work on an economic relief package.
Later today, the President and I will meet again in a teleconference with the nation’s governors.  We will meet at the National Response Coordination Center at FEMA and outline President Trump’s decision to have FEMA take the lead in our national coronavirus response.  Our nation’s response, through FEMA, will be locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.
On testing, we want the American people to know once again that testing is available in all 50 states and is becoming increasingly available literally every hour of the day.  Because of the public-private partnership that the President initiated several weeks ago with major commercial labs, I’m pleased to receive a report today that tens of thousands of tests are being performed every day.  And with the passage of last night’s legislations, state and private labs are now required by law to report all coronavirus testing directly to the CDC, which will give the American public and also give our researchers timely and important information.
It’s important for every American to remember that if you don’t have symptoms, you don’t need to get a test.  We want to make sure that testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms or have a genuine concern about having been exposed to someone with the coronavirus.
Dr. Birx will address county-level data, as well as the progress we’ve made on testing.  And Americans can expect to see how an increased number of cases, as our new testing system comes online, should not be a cause of concern.  She’ll explain the importance of taking into account our new testing system as new data arrives over the next several days.
On supplies, a priority the President has given to our task force: We continue to work with healthcare providers, businesses, and state leadership to identify available supplies — not merely in the federal stockpile, but much more importantly, available across the private sector.
We’re encouraged to see companies like Honeywell and 3M, that I visited a few short weeks ago, take advantage of the changes in the law last night that allow the sale of industrial masks directly to hospitals.  Those companies have now greatly increased, by the tens of millions, their production of so-called N-95 masks that will give our healthcare workers the protection that they need to minister to those that are dealing with the symptoms or the disease of coronavirus.
Following the signing of last night’s bill, all of those masks now have liability protection and the companies can sell industrial masks to hospitals.  It is encouraging, as we called out yesterday, to see construction companies all across America that are, as we speak, checking their supplies and donating those industrial masks to their local hospitals.
And I know I speak on behalf of the President, who spent a lot of time as a builder, when we thank builders across America for partnering with our local healthcare officials.
On the subject of ventilators: We’re working with healthcare providers around America and suppliers.  And I’m — we’re encouraged to learn that we’ve literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators that being — can be converted to treat patients.  And we remain increasingly confident that we will have the ventilators that we need as the coronavirus makes its way across America.
And as we said before, this — we’re all in this together.  And before I step away and give the podium back to the President and to Dr. Birx, I want to call every American’s attention again to the President’s “15 Days to Slow the Spread.”  We continue to hear one case after another, one city after another, where people are putting into practice the principles that the President outlined this Monday.
And make no mistake about it that while for the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low, these guidelines should be practiced by every American in every community not only to lessen the spread of the coronavirus, but to protect the most vulnerable among us.  And I think Americans with their — with — from their hearts are not only practicing these principles of social distancing and avoiding social gatherings of more than 10 people, using drive-throughs at restaurants to protect their own health and the health of their family, but they’re also recognizing that no American wants to inadvertently convey the coronavirus to someone for whom the consequences could be quite serious.
At the President’s direction, we’ll continue to marshal all the resources of government at every level.  We’ll be reiterating that strong partnership with America’s states this afternoon; with America’s governors, pulling all of the private-sector energy together — the innovation that you just heard described.
I know, on this first day of spring, that we’ll get through this and we’ll get through this together.  Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you very much.
Doctor, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  So I know you’re watching the data carefully.  You can see the dramatic increases in the number of new cases, based on our ability to test additional people.  And this will continue over the next two to three days as we begin to have backlogs reduced of the testing.  You all have heard the anecdotes of people waiting five or six days for their test results.  We are moving through all of that as well as testing individuals.
I really want to applaud the frontline healthcare workers — the nurses and the doctors and the testers — that have really prioritized — and the American people — who have prioritized those with symptoms.
The number of test positives is increasing.  That is a dramatically important signature that everybody is doing their job.  Those with mild symptoms are staying home, self-isolating; those with serious symptoms are coming forward to getting testing.  Our test positive rates are now in the 10 to 11 percent range.  That still means that 90 percent of the illnesses out there, even the severe ones, are not COVID-19.
I know many of you are looking at the state-level data.  Still, over 50 percent of the cases come from three states.  This is why we continue to prioritize testing in those states.  In addition, 50 percent of the cases come from 10 counties.  We are a very large country with very many counties.  And I just want to applaud the local and state governments that are implementing their emergency operation centers and plans to ensure.
I want to also really thank the healthcare workers that have been asked to reduce all elective surgeries, medical and dental visits.  This will dramatically increase the number of ventilators that are available in hospitals, but also in ambulatory surgical centers that can be converted and utilized.
And also, the — to the construction industry: We are deeply grateful, the number — as the Vice President said, the number of individuals have come forward with their construction masks, their booties, their tieback suits, and their masks to contribute them to the healthcare sector.
The President’s request to make this available in that legislation changes the ability and increases our availability immediately by the 75 to 90 percent range because of the amount of construction use of those elements.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doctor, very much.
Jerome?  Please.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:   Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  Today, you heard a wonderful announcement from the FDA, and I just want to give a shout-out to Steve — Dr. Hahn — and the folks at the FDA, where about — where several hundred of my Commissioned Corps officers work.  You’re right, Mr President, they are tireless.  They’re doing things that have never been done before to bring the most — most prudent advances to the American people.
But I want to talk about something different, briefly.  We know many of you are home practicing the President’s guidelines for social distancing.  But one thing we should all consider, especially our millennials and Gen Z, is donating blood.  As an anesthesiologist who still practices at Walter Reed, taking care of our wounded warriors and our soldiers, I know donated blood is an essential part of caring for patients, and one donation can save up to three lives.  Blood centers are open now and in need of your donation.  I want America to know that blood donation is safe, and blood centers are taking extra precautions at this time, based on new CDC recommendations, including spacing beds six feet apart, disinfecting surfaces between patients, temperature checking staff, and encouraging donors to make appointments ahead of time so we can space them out.
Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement.  So give blood today.  You’ll feel good about it and you’ll be helping your country and your community during this crisis.  And you might even save a life.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Jerome.  Thank you.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-6/

12:06 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.
We’ll be invoking the Defense Production Act, just in case we need it.  In other words, I think you all know what it is, and it can do a lot of good things if we need it.  And we will — we will have it all completed, signing it in just a little while.  Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it.  It’s prepared to go.  So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act.
Last week, I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which, as you know, we invoked previously and which activated FEMA’s National Response Coordination Center.  FEMA now is fully engaged at the highest levels.
Today, FEMA is activated in every region.  We are at level one — level one being the highest level — which we will work with, and we’ve been working with FEMA.  I’ve done a lot of work with FEMA.  They’re incredible.  It’s always been on hurricanes or tornadoes.
They’re, right now, in Tennessee — a large group working in Tennessee.  Have been incredible.  That was a tragic event.  Alabama, last year, also a tornado.  And then, obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were, in some cases, very devastating.  And, in every case, FEMA came through.
This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do.  We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA.
We’re sending, upon request, the two hospital ships; they’re being prepared right now.  They’re massive ships.  They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides.  One is called the Mercy and the other is called the Comfort.  And they are in tip-top shape.  They soon will be.  They’re getting ready to come up to New York.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it.  He’s excited about it.
And I also — we haven’t made the final determination as to where it’s going to go on the West Coast.  The Comfort is located now in San Diego, and it’s going to be — we’ll be picking the destination fairly shortly.  So those two ships are being prepared to go, and they can be launched over the next week or so, depending on need.
Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington State, as you probably know.  The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January.  But thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we’ve reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later.  That’s a record by many, many months.  It used to take years to do this, and now we did it just in a very short while.
That’s the fastest development in history of what we’re doing with regard to the vaccine.  We’re making very, very big progress.
Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity.  We’re working with several groups to determine if the self-swab — a much easier process than the current process that’s not very nice to do, I can tell you, because I did it.  But we have a current process that’s a little bit difficult.
If you haven’t done — the groups are working on determining if a self-swab by an individual is as effective as the other.  The other is very effective, very accurate.  But we’re going to see if we can do a self-swab, which is — would be a lot more popular, I can tell you that.  So — and that would be administered also by a health official, but it would be a lot easier to do.
The — the fact is that the health professionals would — it would free — it would free up a lot.  Let me just say, the self-swab is what it is: It’s a self-swab; you do it yourself.  The other has to be issued by a health professional, and it’s something that is quite difficult.  And we think it’s working out for the self-swab.  And if it would test positive, the people would go and they would do what they have to do.  But we think that’s probably working out.
I’ve asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers.  We are looking at some very exciting things.  And I’m going to be holding a second news conference either today.  We’re going to talk about the FDA.  Some things are happening that are quite exciting.  And we’re going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow — fairly early tomorrow.  So we’ll see what happens.
But the FDA, at my instruction, is — have been working very, very hard on a number of developments, and we’ll be discussing them with you later today or tomorrow.
And this afternoon, I’ll be meeting with nurses on the frontlines of the battle against the virus.  They are truly American heroes.  They want to get it done.  They’re incredible people.  So we’re going to be meeting with nurses, and I actually look forward to that.  They’re very brave.  They’re taking a lot of risk.  And they — they have done an incredible job and they never complain.
Today, I’m also announcing that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April.  So we’re working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD.
Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation.  In World War Two, young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight.  They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country.  Workers refused to go home and slept on factory floors to keep assembly lines running.
And, you know, the numbers of ships that they built during World War Two, to this day has never — nothing like that has ever been equal.  They were doing ships on a — literally on a daily basis.  Nobody has ever seen anything like it.  To this day, nobody has seen anything like what they were able to do during World War Two.
And now it’s our time.  We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we’ll come through together.  It’s the invisible enemy.  That’s always the toughest enemy: the invisible enemy.  But we’re going to defeat the invisible enemy.  I think we’re going to do it even faster than we thought.  And it will be a complete victory.  It’ll be a total victory.
So we’ll have a second conference, again, having to do with the FDA and this.  I think it’s going to be potentially a very exciting news conference.  And we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it’s today or tomorrow.
And I’ll, with that, ask Mike Pence to say a few words.  And thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning, and now that we have cases in all 50 states, we’re continuing to move out on the President’s call to bring the full resources of the federal government, the full partnership with every state and territory, the full power of the American economy, to support businesses and families.
As the President says to us and every day: We’ll do whatever it takes.  We’re all in this together.
Yesterday, the President met with the tourism industry executives and also had an engaging discussion with all the top companies in our industrial and medical supply chain.
And the President, as you all are aware, also announced today that by mutual consent, the northern border to Canada will be closed to non-essential travel.  This does not include essential travel or the transit of goods.  But it was through a mutual discussion that took place this morning between the President and Prime Minister Trudeau.  And the Department of Homeland Security will be effectuating that decision.
The President spoke with some of the nation’s top business leaders today, again, to speak about the supply chain in the country.  And, for our part, we’re going to be conducting a conference call later today with state and local health officials to renew our ongoing commitment of cooperation and collaboration.
As the President said last week in signing the Stafford Act, he stood up the National Response Coordination Center.  And today at the President’s direction, FEMA has gone to level one. FEMA’s mission is to support disasters that are locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.
And tomorrow, the President will be hosting all the nation’s governors, from a video conference at FEMA, to ensure that they have full connection to all of the activated regions for FEMA going forward.
With regard to testing, I’m pleased to report that we’re increasing the number of tests being performed by the thousands, every day, thanks to the public-private partnership that President Trump forged with commercial laboratories around the country.
Our health experts tell us to remind every American: It’s important to remember people without symptoms should not get tested.  We want to make sure that the supply of testing is there for those that need it most or are symptomatic or in the vulnerable population.
Dr. Deborah Birx, in a moment, will address the progress that we’re making on testing, the infection rate, our recommendations to every American, as well as some important new findings about the impact on youth that we’re gaining from data that’s coming in from Europe that’ll be important to every — every American.
On the subject of supplies, the President has our task force extremely focused.  As the President mentioned yester- —  mentioned that he’s invoking the Defense Production Act today.  Secretary Esper, in a few moments, will describe the ongoing efforts that the Department of Defense is taking to make medical resources available.  Secretary Robert Wilkie will announce decisions the VA has made to expand hospital capacity within their system.
Also, with regard to medical personnel, at the President’s direction, HHS is issuing a regulation today that will allow all doctors and medical professionals to practice across state lines to meet the needs of hospitals that may arise in adjoining areas.
In addition to that, we are again today asking every American and our medical community leaders and hospitals to partner with us in delaying elective procedures across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they’re needed most.  Seema Verma will describe guidance that CMS will be issuing on that front.
And finally, just, I want to remind every American of the President’s 15-day guidance to slow the spread.  We’re grateful for members of the media and the general public that are adhering to these, sharing them with neighbors and friends.  All of our experts continue to believe that if every American will do their part, and embrace and put into practice these principles, that we can significantly limit the reach of the coronavirus in the weeks and months ahead.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Dr. Birx, please.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  So, you know, we continue to look at data every single day.  There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill, and very seriously ill in the ICUs.
We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea that the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk.  It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be a disproportional number of infections among that group.  And so even if it’s a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now.
So we’re looking at that information very carefully.  We have not seen any significant mortality in the children, but we are concerned about the early reports coming out of Italy and France.
So, again, I’m going to call on that generation that’s part of that group that brought us innovation, particularly throughout all of their ability to look around corners and skip through games.  I’m — I always went level by level; I didn’t realize that you could go from level three to level seven.  That’s what they’ve taught us.  They look for things that we don’t see.  We need them to be healthy.
So, again, not only calling on you to heed what’s in the guidance, but to really ensure that each and every one of you are protecting each other.  And so we cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus.  You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome.
Finally, on the testing piece and what we’re learning: I know you know, last week, in bringing the private sector — I think what has been exciting to me over the last two and a half weeks is to see this administration harness the full capacity of the private sector, understanding that a lot of our solutions that we need to confront this virus, a lot rely on the private sector.  Bringing the private-sector commercial labs was critical in — to this process.  We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way, because we asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected.
And so you still may have difficulty getting tests in areas that do not have significant cases.  We’ve had them prioritize the regions where we need diagnosis and their diagnostic percent.  Remember, I told you South Korea was under 4 percent, so 96 percent of people were negative.  The last report we’ve seen from the laboratories have about a 7-plus percent positivity rate.  Still, 93-plus percent or 92 percent are negative.  But I think that’s encouraging to me, personally, that we’re prioritizing appropriately to those areas that have the greatest need
Today and yesterday, Thermo Fisher pushed out most of their laboratory testing capacity, and that will dramatically increase that platform and the ability to run additional tests, in addition to Roche.
So I appreciate everybody’s attention to these numbers.  I’m excited that we’ve prioritized where the need was the greatest.  But again, please follow the guidance and please make sure in every report that you’re putting out that you’re talking about the presidential guidance to actually stop the spread of this virus.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Deborah, very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Mark, please.
SECRETARY ESPER:  Thank you, Mr. President.  So, good afternoon, everyone.  And I want to provide an update on DOD’s coronavirus efforts as we continue to focus on our three priorities.  That’s, first of all, protecting our personnel and their families.  Second, safeguarding our national security mission capabilities.  And third, of course, supporting the administration’s whole-of-government approach.
First of all, though, I do want to assure the American people that the United States military remains ready and capable of defending the country and our interests abroad.  Now, with that, the department is leaning forward in our response to COVID-19.  We have issued international and domestic travel restrictions to all DOD personnel and families that should dramatically reduce potential exposure to the virus.  Those have been in place for some time now.
As I announced yesterday, the Department of Defense will make available up to 5 million N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from our own strategic reserves to the Department of Health and Human Services for distribution.  The first 1 million masks will be available immediately.  We are also prepared to distribute to HHS up to 2,000 operational deployable ventilators for use as needed.
Yesterday, I was at Fort Detrick, Maryland, which is probably the military’s premier research institute, where I got updated on the incredible work our people are doing as part of the interagency team to work on vaccines and therapeutics.  They’re making great progress there.
We also have announced that we’ve certified our 16th lab — or we’ll soon certify our 16th lab to help with processing tests from across the country.
Additionally, I have directed, as the President mentioned, that the hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort, be prepared to deploy to increase the nation’s medical capacity.  And we have also alerted a variety of field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the Commander-in-Chief.
Today, leadership from the Army Corps of Engineers is in New York meeting with Governor Cuomo and his team.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo yesterday and other governors.  I will be speaking to more in the coming days to make sure that they know what DOD can provide through our system to address their needs.
In my conversations with governors and members of Congress about DOD’s resources, I’ve made it clear that we will continue to support the administration’s comprehensive efforts and the country every step of the way, while ensuring our nation’s security remains the top priority.
I want to conclude by thanking again all of our service members and their families who have been affected by this outbreak.  They’re all great heroes.  We are continuing to support them throughout this.  We are all in this together.
Thank you all very much.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mark.
THE PRESIDENT:  Seema, go ahead.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  So, yesterday, the President made a very important announcement about telehealth, and this is allowing our 62 million seniors to be able to get some medical services from the safety of their home, reducing their risk and without any co-pays.
But we’re also making sure that the healthcare system is prepared and that those on the frontlines have the support that they need.  The reality is the stakes are high and we need to preserve personal protective equipment for those that are on the frontlines of this fight.
And to that end, we have put out guidelines over the last two weeks to expand the types of masks that can be used in routine care and saving those N95s for the most risky situations.
Conserving personal protective equipment is also essential to combat the virus.  So today, CMS will announce detailed recommendations to further promote this needed conservation, specifically by limiting non-essential elective medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures.
We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients, and hospitals prioritize what is essential while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients.
And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations.  They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the frontlines, and it will protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.
We fully appreciate that this is going to have a major impact on the healthcare system, but the shared sacrifice is essential to help those that are on the frontlines.
And I want to thank the medical societies, such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Dental Association, that took a proactive approach and already posted these recommendations.  And we’ve also talked to the American Medical Association, and they have fully indicated their support for this recommendation.  We now invite the entire healthcare community to join us in this effort.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Robert.
THE PRESIDENT:  Robert, please.
SECRETARY WILKIE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My instructions from the President were very clear.  I was to do everything imaginable, as aggressively as possible, to protect the 9.5 million veterans who are part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Last month, we established 19 emergency operations centers across the country.  We began to limit the number of visitors who entered our facilities.  We began, I think, the first — we were the first system to begin triaging, across the country in our 170 hospitals, the entrance of anyone into our facility without being questioned or tested.
We expanded those restrictions to those in our 135 community living centers, which have about 7,800 veterans who are in acute — in acute conditions to make sure that they were protected.  We also took the next step and made sure that we limited the dental surgeries that we were provided.  We’ve cut back by one third the number of routine appointments we have had, and we have canceled elective surgeries.
These were all part of the President’s directive to be as aggressive in a public health sense as we could be.  I think we have set the pace for the entire country.
I will say, we’ve often said that we work the most noble mission in the federal government.  Our veterans have been in the toughest spots in the world.  They have been put in conditions that are unimaginable to most Americans, and they have responded.  They have responded clearly.  They have responded with passion.  And also, the 400,000 members of our department who are out there on the frontlines.
The last thing I will say is that you’ve heard a lot about the fourth mission that VA has.  Our first three missions are healthcare, benefits, and memorial affairs.  Our fourth mission is to support the federal government in times of natural disasters and pandemics.
We are the buttress force in case that FEMA or HHS calls upon us to deploy medical professionals across the country to meet crises.  We plan for that every day.  We are gaming out emergency preparedness scenarios.  And we stand ready, when the President needs us, to expand our mission.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Robert, thank you.  Thank you all.  That’s very nice.
Any questions?  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-5/

11:39 A.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everyone.  Thank you.  Progress being made.  And I appreciate you all joining us.
Last night, the FDA announced groundbreaking new policies to further increase testing very substantially so.  All states can now authorize tests developed and used within their borders, in addition to the FDA.  So the states are very much involved.  They have been involved from the beginning.  But we’re stepping it up as much as we can, and the testing procedures are going well.
And within a short period of time, all other private labs will kick in.  This has never been done before, and it’s going to be something very — I think it’s going to be incredible if it’s done properly.  And these are great companies.  These are among the greatest companies in the world, actually.
So the states are going to be dealing through themselves and with local government, local physicians, local everybody.  They’re also dealing with us.  But we have a tremendous testing capacity.
Today, we’re also announcing a dramatic expansion of our Medicare telehealth services.  Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional cost, including with commonly used services like FaceTime and Skype — a historic breakthrough.  This has not been done before either.  In addition, states have the authority to cover telehealth services for their medical patients.  And by doing this, the patient is not seeing the doctor, per se, but they’re seeing the doctor.  So there’s no getting close.
During this time, we will not enforce applicable HIPAA penalties so that doctors can greatly expand care for their patients using telehealth.  So the penalties won’t be enforced.  We encourage everyone to maximize use of telehealth to limit exposure to the virus.  It’s been a very successful method of communication but never used on a scale like we’re going to use on telehealth.  And you’ll be able to also better maintain hospital capacity by doing this.
Earlier this morning, I spoke with executives from America’s fast-food industry — Wendy’s, McDonald’s, all of the big ones, Burger King — and they were great.  We were talking about the pick-ups in light of yesterday’s guidance, you heard, to avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, or public food courts.  We discussed the important role that the drive-through, pick-up, and delivery service can play in the weeks ahead.
So that’s happening, and they have been fantastic.  They have been absolutely fantastic.  And they’ve been doing it already.  But they’re keeping it open and smaller staffs.  They’re very capable people and very capable companies, and they’re doing it, the pick-ups.
Our guidance yesterday urges Americans to take action for 15 days to help stem the outbreak.  So it’s a 15-day period.  I guess, now I would say it’s a 14-day period.  It was 15 days from yesterday, and we’re asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people.  By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy, because I think our economy will come back very rapidly.  So it’s 15 days from yesterday.  We’ll see what happens after that.  If we do this right, our country — and the world, frankly — but our country can be rolling again pretty quickly.  Pretty quickly.
We have to fight that invisible enemy that, I guess, unknown but we’re getting to know it a lot better.
Today, the Senate is taking up coronavirus legislation that includes free testing for those who need it, as well as paid sick leave and family medical leave for workers affected by the virus.  We’re also committed to getting small businesses the support that they need.  In fact, one of the things we talked about with the fast food operations — we spoke to the chairmen and CEOs of all of the companies — but one of the things we discussed is exactly that: getting small businesses support and flexibility that they need for themselves and for their workers, and that’s being worked on right now.
At my direction, Secretary Mnuchin is meeting today with senators on additional stimulus packages.  I can tell you he was meeting with them late until the night, last night, and for a big part of the day yesterday, and tremendous things are happening.  There’s great spirit.  Tremendous spirit.  And I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.
I can say that, with respect to Governor Cuomo, we had a great talk this morning.  We’re both doing a really good job, and we’re coordinating it.  And we agree — you know, different states need different things.  And we — we agree on that 100 percent.  But we had a very good talk, and I think we’re right down the same track, and it’s going to be very successful.
New York has a pretty big problem.  I guess, would be the number one hotspot.  It’s no fault of anybody.  It’s just the way it is.  But we’re working very closely together.  We’re also getting FEMA very much involved.  They’ve been involved, but now we’re getting them to a different level, and we’ll have everything ready.  We’re dealing with the Army Corps of Engineers should that be necessary.  We have them working, in some cases; on standby, in other cases.
But my conversation with Andrew Cuomo was a very, very productive one and a very good one.  And I appreciate that.
We’re giving relief to affected industries and small businesses, and we’re ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy because that’s what’s going to happen.  It’s going to pop.  One day, we’ll be standing, possibly up here, and we’ll say, “Well, we won.”  And we’re going to say that.  As sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that.  And we’re going to win, and I think we’re going to win faster than people think, I hope.
Later today, I’ll meet with the leaders from the tourism industry, as well as industrial supply retailers and wholesalers, to discuss their critical roles.  As you know, I met with the department store people, all of the retailers — the big ones, including Walmart and others — and it was a great meeting.  They’re stocking up their stores like they’ve never stocked them before.  We’re trying to get people to actually buy less if that’s possible.  Buy less.  Don’t take everything.  Just buy what you need for a while.  It’s — they’re going to stay open all hours of the day.  And they’ve really been — they’ve been fantastic.
We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger — frankly, stronger than ever before.  And we recognize that while many American workers can work from home, many others cannot.  Many of our healthcare providers, first responders, and men and women in the food service and manufacturing are showing at — they’re showing up and standing up to provide us with the goods and services we need.
So we want people to stay home where they can, but in many cases, when you talk about food service and manufacturing, certain items in particular, they are — they’re going in and they’re practicing all of the safety rules and regulations that we talk about.
So with that, I’d like to just introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence.  He’ll say a few words, and then I’ll make some other introductions.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning.  It should be very clear to the American people that President Trump has initiated not only a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-America approach.  And the President’s interaction, even today and through the course of this day, with leaders in industry around the country, reflects that we’re not only bringing the full weight of the federal government to bear, but the full weight of the American economy.
And I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how inspired we are at the way the American people have stepped up and the way that American businesses, large and small, have stepped up.  It’s truly been inspiring.
Our task force met this morning.  We continue to focus on President Trump’s priorities of testing, prevention, and supplies.  And in that category, I’m pleased to report that while testing is available in all 50 states, as the President just indicated, through the swift action of the FDA, at the encouragement of governors around the country, now state health authorities can authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.
But also in connection with the FDA’s action, which you’ll hear more about in a moment, we now have continued to expand the public and private partnership that the President forged with vast commercial laboratories around the country, increasing access to the high volume of high-throughput coronavirus testing that is greatly expanding access even as we speak.
Also, our task force received a report this morning on the progress that the U.S. Public Health Service and FEMA are making, working closely with state governments and also partners in the private sector like CVS, Target, Walgreen, and Walmart, to expand remote testing sites around the country.  And we’ll have a full report later this week as those come online.
It’s important the American people understand that testing is happening all over the country.  But all of our health experts wanted me to tell the American people you don’t need the results of testing to know what you should do.  And President Trump’s 15-day coronavirus guidelines are advice for every American in every community.  They’re the result of the best guidance of CDC and our health experts.
And, as the President said, we continue to urge every American over the next 15 days to put into practice the principles in the President’s coronavirus guidelines.  By every American practicing these principles, we believe that we can slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In fact, our experts have told our taskforce that if every American acts on the President’s coronavirus guidelines, we could see a substantial reduction in the spread of the coronavirus.
But as the President said, it will take all of us to do it.  And so, if you feel sick, stay home.  If someone in your house tests positive, keep the entire household home.  Especially if you’re a person with an underlying health condition, we urge you to stay home and practice social distancing from people.  No social gatherings of more than 10 people.  Use drive-through, as the President discussed with leaders in the industry today.  And every American, especially practicing common sense and good hygiene.
For the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low, but we’re asking every American to partner with us in this effort to slow the spread of the virus and especially to be mindful of seniors or others with serious underlying health conditions for whom the threat of the coronavirus can be very significant and very real.
As I said, the President has continued to push our task force to bring a whole-of-government, a whole-of-America approach.  And we continue to be inspired the way our nation’s governors, the nation’s businesses are responding.
We spoke just yesterday with the leaders of every broadcast network in America that will soon be unveiling a public service campaign using CDC guidelines.  And specifically, as we work on the issue of supplies — meetings yesterday with Department of Defense officials about excess supplies; the President and I will be meeting today to speak about the supply chain for hospitals — we would make one specific request, and that is: We would urge construction companies to donate their inventory of N95 masks to your local hospital and forego additional orders of those industrial masks.
Because of what the President asked to be included in legislation moving through the Congress today, those industrial masks that they use on construction sites are perfectly acceptable for healthcare workers to be protected from a respiratory disease.
But we’re asking construction companies that our President knows very well from his background — we’re asking them to donate their N95 masks to their local hospitals and also forego making additional orders.
At the President’s direction, we will — we will continue to do whatever it takes.  We’ll continue to marshal the best of the American people, the best of all the people behind me, the people behind them, our state and local officials.  And we will get through this, and we will get through this together.
Thank you, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike, very much.  Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:   I want to thank Chad Wolf and Homeland Security.  The job they did at the airports was really incredible.  They screened thousands and thousands of people.  O’Hare got backed up, but — a little bit, but they got them out.  But everybody was screened and screened very carefully.  They didn’t want to rush it.  I think it was 13 airports.  And it was — it was an incredible thing.  Then they had a big surge also from the UK and Ireland, and that went very smoothly.  But they did a fantastic job.  They worked long hours and they did a fantastic job.
I’d like to introduce Steve Mnuchin, and then I’m going to ask Steve to leave because he’s going to the Hill.  He’s been working very hard with the Senate and with — actually, with the House on a very, very big, bold package.  It’s going to be big and it’s going to be bold.  And the level, again, of enthusiasm to get something done, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like it.
So, Steve Mnuchin, please.
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’d like to announce some very significant actions that the President has approved today.  The first, I would say, is: Earlier today, I sent a letter to Fed Chairman Powell approving his request to use 13(3).  And what that will do is, the Fed will be setting up a special purpose vehicle, which the Treasury will invest $10 billion in from one of our funds.  That will enable the Fed to guarantee the purchase of A1/P1 commercial paper going forward.  That is a 1-trillion-dollar market and it is critical to American workers, it’s critical to American business, and it’s critical to American savers who have a lot of that money in money market funds.
So we heard, loud and clear, there were liquidity issues.  This is very significant.  And we’ll create — I don’t think we’ll need to use it all, but we have the ability to have the Fed purchase up to $1 trillion of commercial paper, as needed.  That has already created significant stability in the market today.
The second thing I would say is, you know, we’ve previously talked about deferring IRS payments.  The President, earlier this morning, authorized me to announce this program.  I have previously announced we would defer $200 billion.  The President suggested we increase that to $300 billion, which we will be doing.
Now, let me just be clear on the specifics: We encourage those Americans who can file their taxes to continue to file their taxes on April 15, because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds.  We want you to make sure you get them.  Many people do this electronically, which is easy for them and easy for the IRS.
If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to a million dollars as an individual.  And the reason why we’re doing a million dollars is that covers lots of pass-throughs and small businesses, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days.  All you have to do is file your taxes.  You’ll automatically not get charged interest in penalties.
Now, of course, any American has the right to extend their taxes.  We’re not taking that right.  But the President has asked us to go up to $300 billion.  That’s also an enormous amount of liquidity in the system.
The third thing is the President and I worked on a very significant economic stimulus plan.  Thank you for being available last night and throughout this morning.  And I will be presenting that to the Republicans in the Senate this morning and also discussing that with the House.
We look forward to having bipartisan support.  We’re now working with the Senate to pass this legislation very quickly.  And these will be payments to small businesses.  We’ve talked about loan guarantees to critical industries such as airlines and hotels.  And we’ve also talked about a stimulus package to the American worker.  You can think of this as something like business interruption payments for the American workers.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT:  Do you have any questions for the Secretary of the Treasury?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-4/

3:21 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  So, I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing.  That looks very nice.  It’s very good.
I want to thank everybody for being here today.  This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G7 — G7 nations — and they really had a good meeting.  I think it was a very, very productive meeting.  I also spoke with our nation’s governors.
This afternoon, we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days as we combat the virus.  Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus.  We did this today, and this was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom are standing with me.  And that’s available.  And Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes.
It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus, and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way.  We especially worry about our senior citizens.
The White House Task Force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast-evolving situation that this has become all over the world.  It’s all over the world.  It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time.
On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx, and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now.  We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that’s what we are.  Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible.  Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people.  Avoid discretionary travel.  And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts.
If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus.  And we’re going to have a big celebration all together.
With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly.  A lot of progress has been made.  I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial.  This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history.  Not even close.  We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments.  And we’ve had some promising results — early results, but promising — to reduce the severity and the duration of the synd- — of the symptoms.
And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes, we’re doing.  We’re doing it in every way.
And with that, I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend.
Thank you.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think you know, over the last months, we’ve taken very bold action to stop the virus from coming to our shores.  And because of that, we gained time to really get together and understand the progress across the globe of what has worked and what hasn’t worked.
We now need to appeal to every single American so that they can have their role in stopping the spread of this virus.  We’ve talked about things before, about washing your hands, but we really want to focus on: If you are sick, no matter who you are, please stay home.  If someone in your household is diagnosed with this virus, the entire household should quarantine in the house to prevent spread of the virus to others.
The reason we’re taking these strong and bold steps is because we know there is virus spread before you develop symptoms, and then we know that there’s a large group — we don’t know the precise percent yet — that actually is asymptomatic or has such mild cases that they continue to spread the virus.  If your children are sick, please keep them home.
Now, to our older population or those with preexisting medical conditions, everyone in the household needs to focus on protecting them.  Everyone in the household.
I want to speak particularly to our largest generation now: our millennials.  I have — I’m the mom of two wonderful millennial young women who are bright and hardworking, and I will tell you what I told to them: They are the core group that will stop this virus.  They’re the group that communicates successfully, independent of picking up a phone.  They intuitively know how to contact each others without being in large social gatherings.
We’re asking all of them to hold their gatherings to under 10 people, not just in bars and restaurants, but in homes.  We really want people to be separated at this time, to be able to address this virus comprehensively that we cannot see, for which we don’t have a vaccine or a therapeutic.  The only thing we have right now is the amazing ingenuity and compassion of the American people.
We’re appealing to all Americans to take these steps to protect each other and to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread.  These guidelines are very specific.  They’re very detailed.  They will only work if every American takes this together to heart and responds as one nation and one people to stop the spread of this virus.
Thank you.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Dr. Birx.  So just to connect with what I mentioned to you in previous discussions in this room — and Dr. Birx said it very well — that in order to be able to contain and curtail this epidemic to not reach its maximum capability, we have a two-pillar approach, one of which I believe has been very effective in preventing the substantial seeding, and namely the travel restrictions that we’ve discussed many times in this room.
The other, equally, if not more important, is when you have infection in your own country, which we do.  And you know I could read the numbers, but they’re really, essentially, what we’ve seen yesterday: incremental increases, both globally as well as in the United States, with the curve doing that.  So therefore, the kinds of things that we do are containment and mitigation.
This — what we’re mentioning now — the guidelines, when you look at them carefully, I believe if the people in the United States take them seriously, because they were based on some rather serious consideration back and forth, some may look at them and say they’re going to be really inconvenient for people.  Some will look and say, well, maybe we’ve gone a little bit too far.  They were well thought out.
And the thing that I want to reemphasize, and I’ll say it over and over again: When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are.  That’s not word speak.  It means: If you think you’re here, you’re really here because you’re only getting the results; therefore, it will always seem that the best way to address it were to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction.  It isn’t an overreaction.  It’s a reaction that we feel is commensurate, which is actually going on in reality.
So take a look at the guidelines.  Read them carefully.  And we hope that the people of the United States will take them very seriously, because they will fail if people don’t adhere to them.  We have to have, as a whole country, cooperate and collaborate to make sure these get done.
Thank you.

5:15 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Beautiful day outside.  And I think we have some great things to talk about.  I’ll start by discussing the Federal Reserve.  As you know, it just happened minutes ago, but, to me, it makes me very happy.  And I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve.
For starters, they’ve lowered the Fed rate from what it was, which was 1 to 1.25.  And it’s been lowered down to zero, to 0.25 or .25.  So it’s 0 to .25.  That’s a big difference.  It’s quite a bit.  It’s about a point.
And, in addition, very importantly, the Federal Reserve is the — going to be purchasing $500 billion of treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities.  And that number can increase.  But they’re going to start with that, and that’s really good news.  It’s really great for our country.  It’s something that we’re very happy.  I have to say this: I’m very happy.  And they did it in one step; they didn’t do it in four steps over a long period of time.  They did it in one step.
And I think that people in the market should be very thrilled.  And that brings us — we’re the strongest country in the world, by far, financially and every other way.  And that brings us in line with what other countries are.  They’re actually — they actually have negative rates.  But, look, we got it down to potentially zero.  So that’s a big step, and I’m very happy they did it.
And you will not hear anything bad about me unless it’s about a month or two from now.  So I congratulate the Federal Reserve.  I think it’s terrific.  It just came out, just as we spoke.  I wasn’t going to mention Federal Reserve or anything else, but this came out as we were walking up.
I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday.  The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, said — called us and he apologized.  I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace.  But as you know — this is from Google — they put out a release.  And you guys can figure it out yourselves.  And how that got out — and I’m sure you’ll apologize.  But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly.  It would be so, so wonderful.
I just had a phone call with very impressive people — the biggest in the world, in the world of stores and groceries and all.  And I’ll give you the names:
Dave Clark, Whole Foods.
Mark Clouse, CEO of Campbell Soup Company.
Brian Cornell, CEO of Target.
Randy Edeker, Chairman and CEO, President of Hy-Vee.
Jeff Harmening, CEO of General Mills.  A great company.
Kevin Hourican, President and CEO of Sysco.
Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco.
Todd Jones, CEO of Publix Super Markets.
Donnie King, Tyson Foods.
David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill.
Rodney McMullan, CEO, Chairman of Kroger — a big company.
Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart.  He’s been fantastic.  Doug was here, as you know, on Friday.  And he watched the market go up 2,000 points.  On Friday, it went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points.
Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General Corporation.
And Vivek Sankaran, President and CEO of Albertsons.
So these are all phenomenal companies.  These are great companies.  We had a long conversation with them.  And they’ve — they’re going to work 24 hours around the clock keeping their store stocked.
I would like to say that people shouldn’t go out and buy.  We’re going to all be great.  We’re going to be so good.  We’re going to do — what’s happened with the Fed is phenomenal news.  What’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news.
But you don’t have to buy so much.  Take it easy.  Just relax.  People are going in and they’re buying more.  I remember — I guess, during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they’re buying more than they buy at Christmas.  Relax.  We’re doing great.  It all will pass.
The folks that we spoke to, they’ve done a fantastic job.  They’re going to meet the needs of the public.  They’re going around the clock, if they have to.  And they’re committed to the communities where they’re serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time.  And they’re buying a lot of additional things to sell.
But again, they — they actually have asked me to say, “Could you buy a little bit less, please?”  I think — I thought I’d never hear that from a retailer.
All of them are working hand-in-hand with the federal government, as well as the state and local leaders, to ensure food and essentials are constantly available.  And they’ll do it.  There’s no shortages.  We have no shortages — other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy.  It’s going to be there for a long time.
We’re doing numbers, and there’s a pent-up demand that’s incredible.  When this passes, when this goes through, you’re going to see numbers — I think, I predict; I guess I’m allowed to predict just like Wall Street people are allowed to predict, and they’re pretty much in agreement — you’re going to see there’s a pent-up demand like — like a lot of people, including me, haven’t seen before.  But this has to get through.
They know they’re getting through the crisis and will require an all-of-America approach, and that’s very important.  They’re committed to remaining open during this crisis.  Totally open.  They have to stay open.  Those stores have to stay open.  They supply our country.
Our supply chains in America are the most powerful in the world, and they’re all working very hard.  They’re working around the clock.  And the stores are stocking up at a level that’s beyond Christmastime.  And it’s — it’s great.  It was very reassuring speaking to these people.  They have it totally in hand.
There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies.  They said to me, “Could you please tell them just go and buy, enjoy it.”  Have a nice dinner.  Relax.  Because there’s plenty.  But you don’t have to the quantities because it’s hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they’re refilling them.
And we’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the coronavirus, and we will do whatever it takes.  And we’re doing, I think, really, really well.  A lot of good things are going to happen.
I want to thank all of the people standing behind me.  You know, these are phenomenal people, and we have some of them right over here.  But the people behind me have been working around the clock, and they’re doing an incredible job.
We see what’s happening.  We see what’s going on in other countries.  We’re looking at — we’re learning from watching other countries, frankly.  This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus.  It’s incredible.  But it’s something that we have tremendous control over.
I think, very important, the young people and people of good health, and groups of people, just are not strongly affected.  Elderly people that are not well, or not well in certain respects, are, really, a very dangerous group.  We have to watch them.  We have to protect them very much.  We have to really watch over them and protect them because they are very vulnerable.
And with that, if it’s okay, I’m just going to go and make some calls.  I’m talking about Federal Reserve.  I think it’s a tremendous thing that took place just now.  I didn’t know I’d be surprised on a Sunday.  I don’t know if that’s ever happened on a Sunday before.  But I would think there are a lot of people on Wall Street that are very happy.  And I can tell you that I’m very happy.  I didn’t expect this, and I like being surprised.
So our Vice President, who’s doing an incredible job, is going to take over.  And I will see you probably tomorrow.  Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And good afternoon.  With more than 2,900 cases of coronavirus in 49 states across the country, I want to assure the American people that this administration, all of our partners at the state level, and local health officials have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American public.
And at the President’s direction, we will continue not only a whole-of-government approach, but as we’ll discuss today, we’ll continue to build on a whole-of-America approach to confront the coronavirus across the country.
The health experts continue to confirm to us that based on the latest information, for the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low.  But because the risk is heavily weighted to the most vulnerable — to people with immunodeficiencies and to people who are elderly with serious underlying chronic health conditions — our administration and, I know, state administrations will continue to focus on the most vulnerable.  And we will continue to urge every American to be vigilant in practicing good hygiene and taking the advice of the CDC and local health experts to keep those most vulnerable safe.
I know I speak on behalf of the President and our entire team when I say how grateful we are for governors all across the country and the seamless partnership that we have forged with them and with state health officials, with our federal team.
I spoke today to Governor Pritzker of Illinois, and we are in continuous communication with governors a phone call away.  They know that they can contact us and address even the smallest need, because as a — as a former governor, I know firsthand that when it comes to health challenges in America, our states are on the ground in the lead, our local health organizations.  And we’ve built a great partnership.
We also want to express great appreciation to the American people.  Not surprisingly, it is inspiring to see the way tens of millions of Americans are responding with compassion, with common sense.  And we want to express particular gratitude to communities of faith that participated in today’s National Day of Prayer.  We’ve seen places of worship implementing policies to keep those most vulnerable safe.  And also, we’re seeing communities of faith already stepping forward to support and to encourage those most vulnerable.
I heard tell of a church back in Indiana that’s actually no longer having services until April 10th, but in the meantime they’ll be offering daycare to the children of healthcare workers in Central Indiana.  And churches all across the country are taking the opportunity to reach out and put feet on their faith, and it’s truly inspiring.
As the President mentioned today, he spoke today to leaders in the grocery store industry and where people buy our food.  And we heard, and we’re reminded, that America has the most efficient and effective supply chain in the world, and it’s working just fine.
As the President said, he received a commitment from those grocery store executives that stores will stay open throughout the days that lie ahead.  We were told that hours may be reduced to allow for cleaning and to resupply, but American families can be confident your local grocery store is going to be open; it’s going to be well supplied.  And they specifically asked us to encourage Americans: Just buy your weekly needs and grocery, because the grocery stores will remain open.
Also, very movingly, those same executives all reiterated their commitment to continue to support local food banks in the way that our grocers continue to do around America.
Tomorrow, the President and I will be briefing all the nation’s governors from states and territories, and the District of Columbia, to be speaking about the progress that we’re making.  And we’ll be speaking to them specifically about our widening partnership on expanding testing to the American people.
So allow me to speak to that issue, and then I’m going to recognize Admiral Brett Giroir, who will describe for us the excellent work the Public Health Service is doing.  Dr. Birx will describe the importance of the new national public-private partnership for diagnostic testing that is going to open the door to thousands of more tests in real time for the American people in the days ahead.
First, some fundamentals.  As the American people know, testing is now available in all 50 states.  Either state labs are either conducting the tests themselves, or the CDC is processing tests.  They’re using the traditional manner of a manual test that allows for 40 to 60 tests a day.
It is among the reasons why the President, several weeks ago, tasked this group at the White House to reach out to commercial labs around the country and forge that public-private partnership that would bring the high-speed — or more accurately, the high-throughput testing for coronavirus available in real time.
And based on the unprecedented speed of the FDA, which last week approved high-throughput coronavirus testings for Roche and Thermo Fisher, we will now have access in the days ahead to more than 2,000 labs across the country that have the equipment today to process coronavirus tests much more rapidly and a much higher volume for the American people.
In terms of delivering those services, more than 10 states — in addition to CDC labs, public health labs, and labs that states can now authorize in their states — more than 10 states have implemented their own drive-through testing sites.  And we want to commend New York, Colorado, Delaware, Washington State, Texas, and others that have implemented these on-site places where people can obtain tests.
Most are using the current CDC testing, the manual testing, but we are working closely with our governors, as you will hear momentarily, to make sure that the new testing regimen is available for their remote sites as well.
As I mentioned, as of Monday, we will have more than 2,000 labs coming online with the high-speed testing, and we are connecting states to those testing methods.
We’re also working with a number of retail partners to add to the work that states are doing around the country, working to set up parking lot testing centers outside of stores.  And Admiral Brett Giroir will detail the progress that we’ve made over the last 72 hours.
Following the President’s declaration of emergency, the Admiral and our Public Health Service have forged a partnership now with FEMA, made possible by that declaration.  And they’ve reached out to all 50 states to create a process that will enable all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community-based testing site outside of usual healthcare facilities.
The focus of these tests, as Dr. Birx will describe momentarily, will be on those most in need.  A priority will be placed on healthcare workers and first responders who are out there coming alongside people that are being impacted by the coronavirus.  We want to make sure they have access to the testing as a priority.
And then, Americans 65 or over with a cough or a fever or other symptoms will be prioritized over other tests that are extended.
As I mentioned, Admiral Giroir will describe the progress that we’ve made in just a few moments, but we’re going to continue to work very diligently — hour by hour, day by day — in the days ahead to expand testing around the country and access to this extraordinary and unprecedented national public-private partnership for diagnostic testing.
With regard to testing: As we expand testing, we’re so pleased that Congress joined with our administration to make sure that cost is never going to be a barrier to anyone getting a coronavirus test.
As you recall, several weeks ago, the President directed a change in our Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure the coronavirus testing was included.  Health insurers were brought in; they all agreed to waive co-pays.  But because of the good bipartisan work done in the House of Representatives, now all coronavirus testing is free, and it’s free for every American, including uninsured Americans.  And we continue to urge passage of the legislation that will be considered by the Senate this week.
Let me say one final word about the testing issue, and that is that we — as the President often says, we’re all in this together.  And it’s absolutely important that as we expand testing resources across the country, beginning by prioritizing the areas that CDC and our state leadership tell us are most important, it’s important that the tests are available for people that are most in need and for our healthcare workers and first responders that are — that are helping them and supporting them.
As Dr. Birx will describe, the testing that is available should only be done if for any reason you think you may have the coronavirus.  We encourage people to consult their doctor.  And if you’re — if you’re symptom-free, we encourage you to work with us to make sure that testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms.
It’s extremely important that we have the continuing cooperation of every American as we expand testing and make it available during this challenging time in the life of our nation.
With that, I’m going to ask Dr. Birx — oh, excuse me, I’m going to ask Admiral Brett Giroir of the Public Health Service and leader of this great Commissioned Corps behind me to come up and describe the extraordinary work that they have done over the last 72 hours and will be doing each and every day, in conjunction with our states, to expand testing to community-based testing across the country for the American people using this new public-private partnership diagnostic testing.
Admiral?
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  And thank you for your personal interest in support of our team over the last 72 hours as we worked on this critically important project.
So as the Vice President said, over the past 72 hours, we have developed and are beginning to implement now a process and a program of testing that will enable Americans who are in need of coronavirus testing to be tested effectively and efficiently according to a few principles:
Number one, we want to assure that those most vulnerable and those impacted are able to be prioritized.
Number two, we don’t want to do testing that in any way threatens the acute care system.  In other words, we don’t want people going to hospitals and acute care clinics where, number one, they could infect other people or subject themselves to infections.
And number three, we want to balance the needs across the entire healthcare system among diagnosis but also treatment.  In other words, we want to balance the stress on the Strategic National Stockpile and all our commodities so that everyone gets all the materials they need.
So what do we do?  Because, as the Vice President said, last week’s historically fast approval of high-throughput testing, we are now in a new phase of testing.  And you’ve heard Dr. Fauci talk about the new phase.
So we’re going from somewhat manual, relatively slow phases, to a testing regimen that we can test many tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals per week and maybe even more.  We will have 1.9 million of these high-throughput tests available this week with numerous labs, up to 2,000, starting to turn the lights on beginning this week and rolling out over the week.  That is really a game-changer for us because the back-of-the-shop testing capability is there.
The front of the shop is what we’ve been really working on.  In order to get a test there, you’ve got to be able to swab individuals, get them into the system without completely paralyzing the entire healthcare system as we know.
So, with the emergency declaration, this was very, very important to us because it really enabled the historically effective processes of working and empowering states — federally supported, state-led efforts — through the normal FEMA mechanisms.
So for the last 72 hours, representatives of FEMA from across the government and our Commissioned Corps have been working on joining the unique and unprecedented public health mission with the historically successful mission of personal — of distribution centers, places for distribution — the pod system of FEMA.
Our Public Health Service — we’ve already deployed over a thousand officers in support of the coronavirus missions.  That includes to the Diamond Princess, to the borders, to the quarantine stations, to the acute care settings where we’re caring for nursing home residents in Seattle.  So we have a very experienced group, and we brought these together.
So what we’ve really designed in how we’re working with the states: We have contacted all 50 states through the FEMA system — every single region, every single state — to understand where they are.
As the Vice President said, some states are rolling out some of their own community-based testing.  They need to be augmented.  We believe we’ve created a model, based on the Public Health and the FEMA system, that is optimized, that can be used for drive-through or potentially walk-through.  Each of these pod-based units, we believe, can screen 2,000 to 4,000 individuals a day for testing, with all the appropriate personal protective gear, all the appropriate backend and linkage to the public health system, including testing.
We know that we have the logistics to do that.  We know we have the materials to do that.  And again, this is federally supported state-led efforts.  Many states need the full meal deal.  They want dozens of Public Health Service officers to work in protective gear to actually test.  They need supplies, like protective gear; they need swabs; they need the logistical supports.  Other states only need a fraction of that.  They may have all the personnel, but they really need the knowhow, the template, and some of the gear that we provide.
We are going to start implementing this system, this week, in a number of states, primarily those that are the hardest hit right now or are on the rise and the CDC advises us that that’s when they need the testing.
I want to emphasize, again, that we’re focusing on two very important groups — and you’ll hear this said three or four different ways — and the groups that really can be the most impacted or impactful in our outbreak.
Number one is healthcare workers and first responders.  This is very important for two reasons.  Number one, we have to take care of the healthcare workers and responders, because when America needs them, they need to be available and healthy to provide the care that we all deserve.  But it’s also important that if they feel they have a risk of having contacted [sic] coronavirus, that we test them so they cannot spread that, for example, in long-term care facilities where the elderly are.
And the second group would be the elderly.  And we are classifying that, according to risk, is those 65 years of age or older who have a respiratory symptom and a fever of 99.6.  That’s a lower number than you’ve seen before because those who are older do not spike high fevers, like children do — 104, 105.  So you set the bar just a little bit lower.
We do that because we know that they’re at high risk of bad consequences.  And if they test positive, they could engage with their practitioner, telehealth provider, or get in the system to make sure they have just an outstanding outcome.
So that is really where we are.  We’ve made really unprecedented progress.  You will see these sites rolling out progressively over the week.  This is not make-believe.  This is not fantasy.  We’ve developed the model.  We’ve talked to the states.  We’re focusing in on specific locations now.  We will start shipping gear, stuff, tomorrow.  We will start deploying officers tomorrow and Tuesday.  And we’ll begin seeing these sites, in addition to the ones that are springing up now, implemented during this week.
We will have the capability of testing tens of thousands of additional people through these sites every week, in addition to all the capability that’s now going to be distributed in the 2,000 laboratories and the major central, core laboratories.
And I know you have a number of questions that hopefully in the question-and-answer session we’ll be able to answer for you.
But I think this is just a great linkage.  I’m a pediatric ICU doctor.  I take care of sick people.  I know what happens when you get respiratory illness.  The Surgeon General is an anesthesiologist who takes care of people who have respiratory difficulties and manages that.
So we know how this — we know how this works.  We’ve been there.  The most important thing we’ve worked on right now is making testing accessible because of the advances of the FDA and private industry to make these high-throughput tests.  Now we can work on the front end.
With the emergency declaration, we have all the tools, and all of government has really come together with industry, not just government and states.  It’s really been private industry, the manufacturers, to bring the swabs, the personal protective gear, the laboratory testing, the shipping, the fronts with Walgreens and Walmarts working as potential sites.
This has been something, in my mind, that has been unprecedented, the entire society approach working so intensely over the past — certainly over the past weeks, but incredibly on this project over the past 72 hours.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Admiral.  And let me say we are moving out, now that we have the public-private partnership with the major commercial labs.  And now you have our Public Health team as well as FEMA moving out, connecting to the states, to deploy these point-of-distribution community centers.
We’ll also be working closely with members of the media and individual jurisdictions, as well as we’re working with Google and other tech companies to make sure that there’s online resources where people will be able to readily access a questionnaire that will walk them through the symptoms and whether or not a test might be indicated.
And also, in the days ahead, we look forward to that same website being able to direct people to the nearest community center or drive-through center that’s available.
But let me — me let me introduce Dr. Deborah Birx to speak about that — that patient experience — and about the importance of the right people seeking the testing in the days ahead.
Doctor?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Let me just start by recognizing the men and women of the military who are serving us every day.  They are my brothers and sisters.  I was privileged to serve alongside them for quite a long time.
But, critically, I just want to recognize at this moment the Public Health Commissioned Corps behind me.  The Vice President — although he didn’t speak to this — actually went to see them yesterday at the place where they were working, so that we wouldn’t disturb them, because of their level of dedication and work through the last, really, 48 hours non-stop.
So, thank you.  Thank you for your work, and thank you for the work that you brought together.  And thank you, Admiral, for explaining it so quickly.
Let me just go back to the way laboratory work is done in the United States.  I think all of you know, when you go to your doctor, and you need a lab test, it is either done in your doctor’s office, or it’s done in the lab that they send you to.
When we started this emergency response to this virus, we started with what we knew, and that was the flu platform that we use for surveillance.  It wasn’t set up in your doctor’s office.  It wasn’t set up in our hospital laboratories.  It was set up in state and local labs and at the CDC.
Over the last two weeks, we’ve been working with the groups that have served you for decades — the commercial laboratories that you don’t see, but your specimen goes to — to ensure they had the full capacity to meet the needs of the American people. Because it wasn’t going to be 50 to 100 to 1,000 tests; it was going to be tens of thousands of tests that would be needed to be done.
And so, the last two weeks has been spent on really getting what you are used to: the full force of the clinical laboratories and service.
At the same time, what you heard described here is how do we serve the needs of the people in the community where they reside; where we know when we’re talking about people with vulnerable conditions, immunosuppression medical conditions, or the elderly, that we don’t want them having to sit for long times in doctor’s office and hospitals’ waiting rooms.
And you see what state and local governors have done to move past what we would normally do — a referral to your doctor’s office and to your hospital — but really providing community-led services to provide this testing.
What the federal government is doing is augmenting that — augmenting the innovation that existed in South Korea, brought here to the shores of the United States and brought in our own novel way, but utilizing our healthcare delivery system, which is different than South Korea, and adapting our work to our system
So, to the hospitals and to the laboratories: We know that there will be pent-up demand for this.  Make sure every hospital and every laboratory — I’m speaking to my — the people who work in labs, like I did myself.  Make sure you have enough pipette tips, pipettors, and all of the equipment that you need to run this laboratory.
You know what you need.  Make sure you have that and have that available for these tests — because we know with this increased sampling, this increased ability to have community access, additional samples will be going to these laboratories. They can manage the high throughput, but they need all of the supplies that they would normally need to run these tests.  Think of it — if you’re doing HIV viral load, same thing: just what you need.  You know what you need; make sure you have that.  That will be run.
And the most important thing, I know, for each and every one of you is how am I going to get my results.  And so we’re making sure also that the end of reporting is also there; that the reporting is available to you, to your doctor, and also to the state and local governments and the federal government, not with your personal identifiers, but to really understand where there are positives, where there are negatives, so we can ensure that healthcare providers have what they need to meet the demands of the American people and their health needs when they’re there.
Now, let me just say one bit about reporting.  So you will notice, as these tests roll out over this next week, we will have a spike in our curve.  For those of you who watched China and China reporting, remember when they changed their definition and all of a sudden there was a blip in their curve?  We are going to see that.  We are going to see a spike as more and more people have access.
And I want to finish by, again, reminding people how important it is.  I know everybody is going to want to go to these drive-throughs.  But if we could prioritize, like we have asked you to prioritize the care of every person with a preexisting condition and immunosuppression, and the elderly with existing conditions — we’ve asked you to prioritize them and we ask you to prioritize them in the lines, so that our first responders and our healthcare providers and everybody who has difficulty to get to doctors’ offices can utilize this system while we bring all the other traditional systems that you’re used to and have availability for you online over the next few days and weeks.
So, thank you.  Thank you for constantly reminding us how important.  It’s a response of all of America for Americans.  All of America for Americans.  It’s a privilege to be part of this solution and be part of this team.
And again, I want to close by recognizing the Commissioned Corps.  They have spent — I’m not sure they had anything but pizza to eat for the last two days, but we appreciate grat- —
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Donuts.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Apples and bananas.  Apples and bananas.
ADMIRAL GIROIR:  Donuts.
(Laughter.)
DR. BIRX:  All right, don’t follow their guidance.  (Laughter.)
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I’ll be very brief.  I just want to say, listening to the description of Admiral Giroir, I’m very pleased to see how things have evolved.  I think we could describe this as entering into a new phase in the testing space available here in the United States.
You’ve heard me, on many of these briefings, talk about the multifaceted armamentarium that we have to address the crisis of what the world is seeing and the challenge that we’re seeing right here in the United States.
I mean, obviously, the travel restrictions have been, in my mind, a very, very positive way that we have prevented more of the input from outside in that would seat us and make our job more difficult.
And then we have, as I mentioned, the containment and the mitigation from within.  You’re going to be hearing more about advanced guidelines about that, more precise instructions of how we can implement this mitigation within the community.
But now that we have a situation that is going to be rolled out — and remember, I want to emphasize what was just said: We’re not going to go from here to there overnight.  It’s going to be a gradual ratcheting up that I believe is going to happen quickly so that then we can start talking about things and put behind us the multiple understandable questions about testing and move on to see how we can make this multifaceted approach really work for us.  Because as I’ve said many times, and I’ll repeat it: The worst is, yes, ahead for us.  It is how we respond to that challenge that’s going to determine what the ultimate endpoint is going to be.
We have a very, very critical point now.  If you look at the curves that I’ve described multiple, multiple times, this window that we’re in is going to be very important for us to stay ahead of this curve.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Doc.  Stay close.

12:19 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much.  We just completed a very good meeting of the Coronavirus Task Force.  And we — we’re really — they’re really doing a great job, our professionals.  The results are very — very, very good.  And when you compare this to what’s happening around the world, we’re very proud of our people.
And there’s been a tremendous amount of coordination with states, with cities, and they’re a little smaller form of government, and they have things going well.  They’re coordinating with us.  And certain, in particular, I think California has been terrific — the relationship.  New York has been really good.  We’ve had some really good relationships in terms of — especially the hotspots.  And we’re focused on those hotspots.  In some areas, we don’t have no problem whatsoever, and we hope to keep it that way.
Before I turn this over to our great Vice President to provide an update, I just want to express my appreciation for the hard work done by the people behind me and the people back in the various offices, including the fact that I just left the Oval Office.  So we have some people there that are probably watching this or they’re just working.  We’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus, and that’s what we’ve been doing.
Last week, we secured an initial $8.3 billion from Congress for the coronavirus, and that was quickly done and very efficiently done.  And I want to thank all members of Congress.
Yesterday, I declared a national emergency, which was a very big deal because it opened up avenues that we would never be able to open up without it.  And it will make it more than — it will make more than $50 billion available to us immediately in disaster relief funds.  And that’s available for states, territories, and local governments.  So that was really, really good.
We also reached an agreement yesterday on a new legislative package that will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus.  So it was done very, very bipartisan.  It was — it was very nice to see it.  Probably the cooperation — I want to thank Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, who did a fantastic job and worked with Nancy Pelosi and their representatives.  And it was really great.  It worked out very well.
And a lot of people are benefitting by a lot of — a lot of provisions in the bill, which they’re going to be discussing with you today.  And the tremendous provision.  So that’s something that we should talk about.
I was honored to see that the stock market — you were mostly there with us — set a record in a short period of time — over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden.  That was a record.  All-time record.  I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps.  How about every — how about five times a day?  We’ll do one five times a day.  But that was something to watch.  And I had no idea.  We walked back, I said, “So how did that work out?”  They said, “Sir, you just set a new record in the history of the stock market.”  So that was pretty good.
And those great companies that were there, they couldn’t have been too unhappy either, when you think about it, because they’re all very big, publicly listed companies.  So they did a good job.  And more importantly, they’re going to do a good job.  When you look at CVS and Walmart, and all of the tremendous people that were there yesterday, these are the biggest and the best.  And they’re opening up their facilities.  They’re opening up — they’re, right now, literally, working right now on opening — doing something that’s never been done before, to the extent that we’re doing it.  And so we’re very proud of them also.
The bill provides for free coronavirus testing for all Americans who should be tested.  So people that are getting tested are getting this free.  They don’t have to pay — because a lot of people said, “Gee, it’s a lot of money.”  And it is.  It’s a — you know, it’s a pretty complex test actually, and it costs money.  And it’s being provided free, so people don’t have to worry about that.
It also provides paid sick and family medical leave for those who need it, including for those who have the virus, for caregivers, and those looking after children affected by school closures.  So that’s all taken care of also.  And we’ll continue all of these different actions.  We have other things planned.
We’re going to also be working with companies that are affected financially.  Our country is in the best financial shape.  We’ve — it’s so different than in the past, over the years.  If you look at some of the real big crises we had, it was financial problems and different things.  We now are in very, very strong financial shape with all of the trade and all of the other things that we’ve been doing.  It’s been pretty amazing.
We hope the Federal Reserve will finally get on board and do what they should do, because we’re doing things that they should be doing, frankly.  And we can all do them together, but they should be much more proactive.  Other boards and other countries and people representing those countries are taking a much more aggressive action than our Fed, for the most part.
So we’d like to see the — you know, if you look at central banks — yesterday, what they did — we want to see our Federal Reserve be much more proactive.  It’s important.  But in the meantime, we’re doing things that — that are — that have been really well received.  Now, I guess you saw that yesterday at the end of the day with what we’ve done.
We have a lot of things to tell you, in terms of respirators, in terms of all of the different things.  The masks are being made by the millions.  Millions and millions.  We have plenty now, but we’re ordering for the millions.  We’re ordering worst-case scenario.  Always — we always say “worst-case scenario.”  And that’s where we’re going.  So I just want to thank everybody.
I think the press has been really — over the last 24 hours, I think the representation has really been very fair.  For the most part, been very fair.
We’re all in this together.  It’s something that nobody expected.  It came out of China, and it’s one of those things that happened.  It’s nobody’s fault.  We all — we all will solve this problem; we’ll solve it well.
I think the American people have been incredible in the way they’ve acted.  There’s been — and if you look at companies and sports leagues and all of the things, what they’ve done is — is just something very special, without being told, necessarily.  In some cases, perhaps they were told, actually.  But for the most part, they want to get it over with.  They want to get it over with quickly and with very little death.
As of this moment we have 50 deaths, which is — a lot of good decisions were made, or that number could be many times that.  But that’s based on a lot of good decisions, one or two in particular.  You know that Europe was declared the hotspot yesterday, a big hotspot and number one.  And we — we made a decision quite a bit prior to that, but we saw what was happening.
But if you have any questions, this group will be very happy to do it.  But I just want to say they have been — led by Mike Pence — they have been incredible, the job they’re doing.  They’re working 20 hours a day.  This man is working 20 hours a day or maybe more.  Is it more?  I think it’s more.  Tony has been working — I’m just looking at this whole group.  And we’ve created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me.  I watched him the other day.  It was such a fantastic job you did, and I really appreciate it.
But they’re going to be answering questions.  And we have a lot of new information, so I think you’ll find it very interesting.  And I’ll be going back to the Oval Office.
Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

5:43 P.M. EDT
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  We’ve just completed today’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and I couldn’t be more proud of the efforts of the men and women standing behind me or all of those standing behind them.
President Trump said from early on that this would be a whole-of-government approach.  And today gives evidence of the fact that it is also a whole-of-America approach.  We’re bringing the full resources of the federal government and the full resources of — of this great economy and our great business sector to bear in protecting the American people and protecting American families.
A few updates from today: As we continue to expand testing availability across the country — testing is now available at all state labs.  By the end of this week, there will be more than 4 million more tests made available in jurisdictions around the country; 1 million are already in place.  And thanks to the good work of our top commercial labs that the President Trump brought together yesterday, LabCorp and Quest are in the process now of distributing and marketing coronavirus tests all across America.  And we’re working with state local officials to ensure that that happens as rapidly as possible.
But as the testing is expanding, we wanted to make sure the American people knew that testing was available to them and that cost would not be a barrier.
Today, President Trump assembled the top health insurance executives in America.  And, as we announced earlier today, all of our major health insurance companies have now joined with Medicare and Medicaid and agreed to waive all co-pays; cover the cost of all treatment for those who contract the coronavirus; they’ve committed to no surprise billing; and they’ve committed to encourage telemedicine.
It was a year ago that Medicaid actually expanded to pay for telemedicine.  Medicare pays for telemedicine.  So now, for seniors who may think that they are either at risk or have contracted the disease, they can get medical advice without having to go to the doctor or go to an emergency room.
I know I speak for President Trump when I say how grateful we are to see our health insurance industry step forward to meet this need so that — that no American should be concerned about — about being able to pay for or afford the cost of a coronavirus test if they deem and their doctor deems it to be appropriate and necessary.
The President also went to Capitol Hill today to meet with members of the United States Senate Republican caucus.  There, he talked about an economic package, including a call — he’s calling for payroll tax relief.  And I think, most important to the President’s heart, we want to make sure that hourly workers — hardworking, blue-collar Americans that may not have paid family leave today — that small- and medium-sized businesses in America would be afforded the resources to provide paid leave so that no one would feel that they have to go to work if they might be infected or if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.
We had a good reception on Capitol Hill.  Our legislative teams have fanned out.  We’re going to be working with Republican and Democrat leadership to move an economic package.  Larry Kudlow will be reflecting on that in just a few moments.
We also talked about what are known as N95 masks and we’re working — Senator Deb Fischer and others have important legislation that would extend temporary liability protections so that masks that are made for industrial use could be sold to hospitals to ensure that our healthcare workers are properly protected and outfitted.  And we’re grateful for growing bipartisan support for that measure, and we’re going to be working earnestly with Republicans and Democrats to move a reform that would make more N95 masks available.
I’m also pleased to report that we did receive, this afternoon, a comprehensive proposal from the cruise line industry — a proposal that includes advanced screening, improving medical services on ships, providing for airlift evacuation and land-based care at the expense of the cruise lines for anyone that might be not only infected with the coronavirus, but with any serious illness.  We’ll be reviewing that in the next 24 hours.  The President’s objective is for us to make cruise lines safer, even as we work with the cruise lines to ensure that — that no one in our particularly vulnerable population is — is going out on a cruise in the near future.
I’m going to recognize Dr. Fauci to talk about where we are.
And Dr. Birx will give us some research that she’s done on the scope.  We’ll have other updates.  But let me say once again: This is a whole-of-government approach and from early on, President Trump has insisted that our — that our government at the federal level, all of our partners at the state level work in concert to protect the American people.
And, as we stand here today, the risk to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low, but we’re absolutely determined to give every American the tools and the information that they need to protect themselves, their families, their — their workplace, their schools.  And — and we’re going to work together.  We’re going to work together to see our way through this.  And — and working with leaders in both parties in Congress, working with — with leaders at the state level all across this nation, I’m confident we will.
With that, Dr. Tony Fauci for an update on the status.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  Just to give you a very brief sketch of what we do every day: The cases continue to increase globally.  We’re parti- — paying particular attention to the cases in Europe in Italy and France, in which we’re starting to see that up at the same time as the relative number of new cases come down from China.  What we’re seeing in Europe is that Europe is in that upslope.  So that’s something that is expected.  That’s the way these kinds of outbreaks go.  This is not a surprise to anybody if you look at the history of infectious diseases outbreaks.
In the United States, we continue to have new cases.  As of this morning, there was 712, I believe, with 27 deaths.  Guaranteed, by the time of this evening, that’s going to be up and there’ll be several more.  And tomorrow, there’ll be several more.
So we realize that this is something obviously that we’ve been saying all along that we’re taking very seriously.  Now, the question is, what are we going to do about that?  And there are a number of things that one can do in order to blunt it.  If you look at the curves of outbreaks — you know, they go big peaks and then they come down.  What we need to do is flatten that down.  That would have less people infected; that would ultimately have less deaths.  You do that by trying to interfere with the natural flow of the outbreak.
So what we’re saying today is that although we keep coming in and saying, appropriately, that as a nation, the risk is relatively low, there are parts of the country right now that are having community spread in which the risk there is clearly a bit more than that.  And you know the places: you know, Washington State, California, New York, and Florida.
But what I want to talk to you about today, just for a moment or two, is that we would like the country to realize that, as a nation, we can’t be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago.  That it doesn’t matter if you’re in a state that has no cases or one case, you have to start taking seriously what you can do now.  That if and when the infections will come — and they will come.  Sorry to say, sad to say they will.  But when you’re dealing with an infectious disease — you know, we always have that metaphor that people talk about that Wayne Gretzky, you know, he doesn’t go where the puck is, he’s going where the puck is going to be.  Where we want to be: where the infection is going to be, as well as where it is.
So what we have here — if you could see that here what — is here is that if you go to Coronavirus.gov — remember when Dr. Birx, yesterday, mentioned some of the things that we put together?  These are really simple: keeping the workplace safe, keeping the home safe, keeping the school safe, and keeping commercial establishments safe.  This should be universal for the country.  Everyone should be doing that, whether you live in a zone that has community spread or not.  When you have community spread, you obviously are going to ratchet up the kinds of mitigations that you have.  But at a minimum, this is the minimum that we should be doing.  So everybody should say, “All hands on deck.  This is what we need to do.”
So I’ll stop there and later I’ll be happy to answer questions.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Birx?
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, and thank you, Dr. Fauci, for that clarity.  We continue to monitor the situation across the country and across the globe.  And we are very fortunate — between Dr. Fauci and I, we have long-term contracts out there in many of these countries that are experiencing current outbreaks.
We continue to review all the scientific literature to look for insights and to really determine who’s at the greatest risk.  And that’s why we’ve talked to you about people with immunodeficiencies at any age, people with medical conditions, and the elderly, and how important it is all of us to take these precautions in the household to protect others because we have circulating flu and other respiratory diseases at this time.
We all have to act like all of those diseases — any respiratory disease can be transmitted to others.  And as we said yesterday, we’re hoping that decreases all the respiratory disease we’re experiencing.
Finally, we got new reports out of China, who had nine pregnant women during an acute COVID infection and all nine were infected.  Both — and they delivered while they were infected and all nine babies were healthy and the mothers were healthy.  So we continue to look for data like that to be reassuring to the American public.  At the same time, ensuring that every single person is participating in this response to this virus and taking those precautions that we should be taking every day.
If we start doing this today, we will be ready next year for any of our respiratory diseases because I think we’ll be able to show that these simple — simple household, simple work, simple school, simple business approaches across the country can change all of our respiratory diseases.
So we thank you for getting the message out.  We thank you for the participating and ensuring in your households and in households around America that we’re protecting all of those who need our support right now.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Excellent.  Thank you, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci.  And this information is available at Coronavirus.gov.
And as we said, we can’t say often enough, the risks of contracting the coronavirus to the average American remains low.  But for senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions, the potential for serious consequences is very real.  And make no mistake about it, by practicing these habits in your home, your school, and your business, you’re not only protecting your health, but you’re also protecting those that are most vulnerable.
With that, for an update on our — the progress that President Trump made today with our health insurance companies, I’d like to recognize Seema Verma.
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  As the Vice President said, we had a terrific meeting with the insurance companies, a real example of a public-private partnership where they agreed to waive co-pays for testing, not do any surprise billing, and also cover the costs of the COVID virus associated costs.
The other things that they did is they asked the President for more flexibility in Medicare Advantage plans and the President agreed to do that.  And so today, we issued guidance to our Medicare Advantage plans that not only can they waive the costs for the tests, but they can also go further to removing prior author- — authorization requirements.  They can waive prescription refill limits.  They can allow for mail delivery of prescription drugs and expand more access to telehealth services if they weren’t offering that in their plan.
Also, at CMS, we continue to work with healthcare providers around infection control practices.  We met with home health agencies and also hospitals, and today we issued guidance to dialysis facilities, as well as home health agencies around infection control.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  There’s been a great deal of attention about the Grand Princess.  And HHS, working with the Coast Guard and with the Department of Defense, is currently working through disembarking American passengers, returning foreign nationals to their country.  And I wanted to ask Secretary Azar to speak and update us on the progress.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you.  So with regard to the Grand Princess, I wanted to first express our appreciation to Governor Newsom, to the Mayor of Oakland, the people of Oakland, the longshoremen, the stevedores who’ve helped with bringing it in and clearing the — clearing the dock area so that we can do all of our operations there.  We’ve got Admiral Abel here with us today, who’s been leading the Coast Guard efforts.  And then Deputy Secretary Biegun from State has done incredible work with our foreign partners to help with the repatriation of their nationals who are on board the ship.
As of — our data that I’ve got is as of noon, Pacific Time, today.  So this will have increased quite substantially since — since my last update.  But as of noon, Pacific, we had 548 individuals who have been offloaded from the ship.  Two hundred and twenty-eight Canadians are already back in Canada — flown there, I believe it was overnight.  A hundred and seventy-one Californians were taken by the government of California and are now at Travis — Travis Air Base.  Twenty-six individuals were sick, and they’re being — they are being treated for various — it could be from the novel coronavirus, it could also just be we had some frail individuals who are sick that needed treatment.
Our goal is to get all of the citizens of California off today to be in the care of the California State Government, as well as to get the UK citizens off today so that they could be repatriated to the United Kingdom.  We continue to work with other countries on all of those maneuvers.  We will have non-California residents who will be in transport to the bases at Dobbins and at Lackland today, we hope, but — or tonight.
So everything is progressing.  It seems to be progressing well.  We’re using the highest isolation quarantine procedures, medical screenings possible to ensure the safety of not just the passengers but also of the local communities and all of the healthcare workers and others — emergency responders who are helping.  So thanks to all of our partners for this — their help with this very complex operation.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Well done.  Good report.  And let me echo the Secretary’s appreciation to Governor Gavin Newsom, the State of California, the City of Oakland.  It has literally been a seamless partnership.  Everyone on that ship will be tested, isolated, and quarantined as appropriate and provided with treatment.  The crew on the ship, other than those who were ill, will be quarantined on the ship offshore.  But it really represented the kind of partnership and cooperation from every level of government that — that every American, I know, is grateful to see.
With that, on the economic front: Larry Kudlow.
MR. KUDLOW:  Thank you, sir.  All right, yesterday, in a meeting in the Oval, the President — acknowledging there are going to be challenges on the health and economic side, he mentioned that he intended to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these challenges.  And accordingly, as the Vice President said, up at the Republican Senate luncheon today — and he mentioned it in this room yesterday — President Trump has unveiled his proposals — strong proposals — for a temporary payroll tax cut holiday, which I think he would prefer to last through the end of the year.
Also, administratively, as Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and others have suggested, we are trying to — we will use assistance to unpaid sick leave people — a very important point; also small and medium businesses — another important point.  And also, possibly, to some distressed industries or sectors in the economy, maybe tax deferral might be a useful tool and other means.
So this is strong, across-the-board package.  We are consulting with leaders in the House and the Senate, with respect to this package and particularly the payroll tax holiday.
Let me just say, coming into this difficult period, the economy is in fundamentally in good shape.  We saw a blockbuster jobs report last Friday.  Today, for example, the Small Business Confidence Index — the NFIB Business Confidence Index registered a very strong number, keeping its near-record high.  The unemployment remains low at 3.5 percent.  Other indicators look pretty good.  We had a lot of momentum in the first quarter.  Good thing.
I recognize the challenges and that is why we are proposing these fiscal measures to combine with monetary measures that have already taken.
And again, I will repeat the President’s words — it just struck me, as his determination — he intends to bring the full power of the federal government to deal with these health and economic challenges.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Larry.  Well said.  And a word from Surgeon General Jerome Adams.  General.
SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS:  Good evening, everyone.  As Surgeon General, whether it’s opioids or cigarettes or the coronavirus, my job is to help the American people understand how to live a healthy life.  And I’m asking all of you — I’m imploring all of you to help share my prescription for America to overcome this coronavirus situation that we’re in.
There are three parts to it. Number one: Know your risk.  As you’ve heard many times but it’s still important to impress upon America: If you are immunocompromised, if you have chronic medical conditions, if you are over the age of 60, you are at higher risk.  If you are a child or young adult, you are less likely to be impacted by the coronavirus.
Number two — the second part of the prescription: Know your circumstances.  Are you in an environment where you can telework? Are you planning on going to large gatherings like church?  Do you live in a community that is being particularly impacted by the coronavirus?  And you can find out this information from your state or local health department.  Does your state have a hotline that you can call into to help you assess symptoms?  Again, knowing your circumstances.
And number three, and this is the most important part: Know what you can do to stay safe.  And we have really leaned into Coronavirus.gov.  Please send people to that website.  We’ve put the tools on there for individual groups, specific audiences, so that people can understand how to stay — stay safe.  If we follow this prescription, we will — we will overcome the coronavirus.
As Dr. Fauci said, we will see more cases.  Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths.  We have not hit the peak of this epidemic quite yet, but if we follow this prescription, then we will decrease the number of people who are impacted, we will decrease the number of people who will die, and we will more quickly get to the end of this situation.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Great job.  Questions?  Please.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force/

6:34 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  We just attended a very important task force meeting on the virus that everybody is talking about all over the world.  No matter where you go, that’s what’s on people’s minds.  And we are going to take care of, and have been taking care of, the American public and the American economy.
We are going to be asking tomorrow — we’re seeing the Senate.  We’re going to be meeting with House Republicans — Mitch McConnell, everybody — and discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief — very substantial relief.  That’s a big — that’s a big number.
We’re also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they’re not going to ever miss a paycheck.  We’re going to be working with companies and small companies, large companies — a lot of companies — so that they don’t get penalized for something that’s not their fault.  It’s not their fault, it’s not our country’s fault.
This was something that we were thrown into and we’re going to handle it, and we have been handling it very well.  The big decision was early when we shut down our borders.  We’re the first ones ever to do that.  We’ve never done that in our country before.  Or we’d have a situation that would be a lot more dire.
Also, we’re going to be seeing Small Business Administration and creating loans for small businesses.  We’re also working with the industries, including the airline industry, the cruise ship industry — which, obviously, will be hit.  We’re working with them very, very strongly.  We want them to travel.  We want people to travel to certain locations and not to other locations at this moment.  And hopefully that will straighten out sooner rather than later.  But we’re working with the industries, and in particular those two industries.
We’re also talking to the hotel industry.  And some places, actually, will do well, and some places probably won’t do well at all.  But we’re working also with the hotel industry.
But the main thing is that we’re taking care of the American public, and we will be taking care of the American public.
And I really appreciate the professionals behind me and the professionals actually behind them, in a different room.  We have a tremendous team, and it’s headed up by our great Vice President, Mike Pence.  And I want to thank Mike because he’s been working 24 hours a day, just about.  He has been working very, very hard, very diligently, and very professionally.  And I want to thank him, and I want to thank the team.  And I’ll have Mike say a few words.
Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Mike?  Please.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We just completed the day’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  We had the opportunity to brief the President today on a broad range of issues.
And once again, because of the unprecedented action that President Trump took in January — suspending all travel from China; establishing travel advisories for portions of South Korea and Italy; establishing screening of all direct flights, all passengers from all airports from Italy and South Korea — we have — we have bought a considerable amount of time, according to all the health experts, to deal with the coronavirus here in the United States.
In fact, as I stand before you today, the risk of contracting the coronavirus to the American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low.
With that being said, the President did deploy not just a whole-of-government approach, but also a whole-of-America approach.  And last week, at the President’s direction, we met with leaders in industries, from nursing homes to airlines, pharmaceutical companies, commercial labs, and it’s had great, great impact.
Pharmaceutical companies are already working, literally around the clock, on the development of therapeutics; that will be medicines that can bring relief to people that contract the coronavirus.  And I know how pleased the President was to learn that the commercial labs in this country, led by companies like LabCorp and Quest, have already brought a test forward and are taking that to market effective today.
This week, at the President’s direction, we’ll be meeting with hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, and all — building on top of what the President will be announcing tomorrow with regard to economic relief for working Americans.
We also met today in a conference call with 47 of America’s governors.  We were able to brief them on the latest — the progress that we’ve made.  We were able to confirm with them that testing is now available in all state labs in every state in the country.  Over a million tests have been distributed.  Before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed.  But as I said before, with the deployment of the commercial labs, we literally — we literally are going to see a dramatic increase in the available — availability of testing, and that’s all a direct result of the President’s leadership.
Today, in a few moments, we will — we will outline community guidance that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci will be publishing.  At President’s direction, we’re going to be providing guidance about how to keep your home safe, how to keep your business safe, how to keep safe and healthy at your school.  And we’ll be publishing that information and speaking about that.
A brief word about the Grand Princess: The Grand Princess has docked this afternoon in Oakland, California, at a commercial dock.  Twenty-five children, we were happy to learn through the screening over the last two days — the 25 children on the ship are all healthy.  Of the people that have contracted the coronavirus — 21 in all — they’re being dealt with in proper isolation.
Working with health authorities in California, we hope before the end of today to begin to disembark California residents to Travis Air Force Base in Miramar.  We’ve made arrangements with Canada and the UK to take their passengers back.  They’ll be transported directly to the tarmac, charter flights home.
And tomorrow, the remaining passengers will be transported, again, through very, very carefully controlled environments — buses out to the tarmac and flown to military bases in Georgia and Texas.
All the passengers will be tested, isolated as appropriate, quarantined as appropriate.  And I want to express appreciation to the Governor of California and his administration, the Governor of Georgia, the Governor of Texas, for their strong cooperation with us in resolving the issues around the Grand Princess.
It has been a — it has been a partnership which the President directed us from the very beginning.  And the process that Bob Kadlec will detail, and any questions in a few moments, continues to work and move forward.
The remaining people on the ship — the crew itself will push off from the dock, and they will be quarantined and observed and treated shipboard.  But the President made the priority to get — to get the Americans ashore, and we’re in the process of doing that, as well as returning the foreign nationals.
Let me just say one other point: As the President has spoken today to congressional leadership, one of the things that I informed the President that I’ve been hearing from governors is the concern about hourly wage earners in this country feeling that they had to go to work, even if they were ill.  And the President has tasked this economic team, and is working already with leaders in the Congress, to make sure that anyone is not — feels that they’re at risk of losing their job or losing a paycheck because they may contract the coronavirus.
When we tell people, “If you’re sick, stay home,” the President has tasked the team with developing economic policies that will make it very, very clear that we’re going to stand by those hardworking Americans, stand by those businesses large and small, and make it possible for us, as the President said from the very beginning, to put the health of America first.
We’ll be available to take any questions on any of these topics, but, Mr. President, I didn’t know if you wanted to speak a few more, in closing.
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think what we will be doing is having a news conference tomorrow to talk about various things that we’re doing economically — there’ll be very major — including, obviously, the payroll tax cut.
And so we’ll be meeting again tomorrow afternoon.  We’ll be coming back from the Senate, and we have a lot of very important meetings set up.  And we’ll have a press conference sometime after that, and we’ll explain what we’re doing on an economic standpoint and from an economic standpoint.  But they will be very — very dramatic.  And we have a great economy, we have a very strong economy, but this came — this blindsided the world.  And I think we’ve handled it very, very well.  I think they’ve done a great job.  The people behind me have done a great job.
So I will be here tomorrow afternoon to let you know about some of the economic steps we’re taking, which will be major.  Thank you very much.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/

THE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. We just completed today’s lengthy meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and, at the President’s direction, have continued to implement his whole-of-government approach to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear to confront the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
Let me begin, as always, by saying that according to all the experts gathered here and on our task force, the risks of the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low. But that being said, we’re continuing to lean into this effort in full partnership with state and local health authorities around the country to ensure that we do everything to prevent the spread of the disease, to mitigate its expansion, and to provide necessary treatment to Americans that have been impacted.
But first, let me turn my attention — before we speak about some of our broader efforts and hear from some members of the task force — to an issue that I know is on the hearts and minds of people across the country. The Grand Princess cruise ship has been moored off the coast of California since Wednesday night. I want to commend the efforts of our Coast Guard that heroically flew coronavirus tests to the ship. And we received those results.
Working in close consultation with Governor Gavin Newsom and the state of California, we have developed a process for addressing our findings and resolving the circumstances facing Americans and people from around the world and the crew on the Grand Princess.
First the results: Among those tested, 46 persons were swabbed, 21 of those on the ship tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 tested negative, 1 test was inconclusive. Again, let me say: Twenty-one — twenty-one individuals on the Grand Princess tested positive. Among those were 19 crewmembers and 2 passengers.

GOVERNOR INSLEE: Welcome to Washington State. We’ve just finished very productive meetings with the Vice President. We in Washington are very appreciative of him being here today. He not only helped us with some issues today in our partnership with the federal government, but he has already helped us in recently removing some federal restrictions that would have made it more difficult to have testing for the coronavirus, which we appreciate.
We had very helpful meetings, talking about our ability to increasing the testing capacity for the virus in the United States. We had some great discussions about some of our unemployment compensation issues to help more people who might be quarantined to be able to have assistance. We had discussions about the ability to have additional surge capacity in our medical delivery system and our ability to have immediate help from the federal government with one of our nursing homes and other capacity.
And I think that he has been very remarkably adept at fielding our inquiries, and I know he’s going to go back and help to continue this effort.
I also want to compliment his agency directors, who have been assistance as much personally to me, giving us some additional scientific information. So I think we have a good partnership between the state of Washington and the federal government, and I’m very appreciative of him being here in such short order. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thanks, Governor Inslee. And to your outstanding healthcare team — Dr. Wiesman — it is good to be here. Washington State is on the frontlines of the coronavirus in America, and the people of Washington State should be proud of your state and local leadership, the healthcare leadership, the first responders. The way you’ve come alongside families that have been impacted has really represented the very best standard of care. And all of America’s hearts are with the people of Washington State today.
Governor Inslee, as I told you, President Trump wanted me to be here to ensure the people of Washington State that we are with you and that the full resources of the federal government will continue to be brought to bear as people across the Seattle area and across Washington State deal with the coronavirus.
I do want to — I do want to commend, Governor Inslee, your team’s effort and the seamless partnership that was forged from the very beginning between our administration and your administration here at the state level.
Dr. Wiesman just informed me that he literally speaks to the head of the CDC every day, multiple times a day. We’ve had personnel on the ground, literally, since the first corona case was detected here in Washington State.
And President Trump wanted me to be here to talk to the people that are on the ground, the emergency center earlier today, to talk to policymakers here to ensure that we continue to provide that level of support.
I’m also pleased to be joined by so many members of Washington’s delegation to the Congress of the United States. The good news was today that the United States Senate passed, as the House of Representatives did yesterday, legislation that will provide nearly $8 billion in support.
And I want to thank these members of Congress for their efforts — swift and bipartisan — exactly what the American people would expect in a moment like this in the life of our nation.
The resources, Governor, as we discussed, are not simply resources for federal agencies, but rather there is also considerable investment available for states, like Washington, that are dealing with the coronavirus and also local healthcare providers. And we’re truly grateful for their efforts.
We have, as the Governor just said, forged a strong partnership between the federal government and the state government, and we’ll continue to look for ways to strengthen that in the days ahead.
As I stand before you today, at this moment in time, we have at least 150 cases of coronavirus in the United States, including 70 confirmed cases in Washington State. Among the balance of those, some 49 are Americans that we returned home from China and from being on the cruise ship, the Diamond Princess.
And, of course, as we stand here today, our hearts grieve the loss of 12 Americans. And particularly to those families here in Washington State, please know that you have the condolences of every American and you’re on our hearts for your loss.
While the coronavirus has spread in the Seattle area and new cases are detected around the country every day, the good news is that the vast majority of all of those who have contracted the coronavirus are recovering and doing well. The truth is that the risk of contracting the coronavirus to the average American remains low, according to all the health experts that I have here with me today and that are a part of our efforts at the national and state level.
And while there may be more cases detected in this state and around the country as we continue to expand testing, most cases, the experts tell me, will be mild, will have flu-like symptoms, and the Americans will — involved will fully recover.
We have observed — as you have, Governor, here in Washington State — though, that seniors and Americans with underlying health conditions are particularly vulnerable to serious disease, and especially following the heartbreaking loss of life at the nursing home in Kirkland. But we’ve taken action to address that, just as you have here in Washington State.
The Director of the Center for Medicaid [Medicare] and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, is with me today. And this week, at President Trump’s direction, we raised the standards for all nursing homes in America with regard to guidelines for preventing the spread of infectious disease. And also at the President’s direction, all 8,000 of our inspectors at CMS nationwide will be focusing all of their inspection efforts at nursing homes on compliance with federal standards for preventing the spread of infectious disease. We want to make every effort to ensure that our seniors and our nursing homes are as safe as possible from the spread of the coronavirus.
And on the subject of testing, we’ve been making steady progress. And I was encouraged to hear, Governor, that — that CDC has been able to provide kits to Washington State to meet your demand. But we know that while — while we’re meeting the demand of cases we know about today, we still have a ways to go to ensure the tests are available for any future cases and also for people across your state and across the country that may be concerned that they had contracted the coronavirus and want to obtain a test.
But I’m happy to report and have you confirm that the CDC has prioritized the delivery of coronavirus test kits to Washington State and to California. And I can assure you, Governor, we will continue to do so.
But by the end of next week, CDC’s test supplier — a company known as IDT — will distribute kits across the country that will enable roughly 1.2 million Americans to be tested for the coronavirus. Those kits will be delivered in just a matter of a few days. By the end of next week, another 4 million tests will be available. But it’s still just a beginning.
As our nation continues to hear of new cases every day, we want to make sure that testing is available broadly. And to that end, President Trump brought together the leaders of the top commercial labs in the country. As we speak, at the President’s urging, they have formed a consortium, and we’ll be working with the leading commercial labs in America who tell us that, in a matter of weeks, through validation efforts that we’ll do through the FDA, they could well be in a position where, in the not-distant future, your doctor, your local pharmacy, your local MedCheck will have access to a coronavirus.
We have a ways to go, but President Trump said early on that we would bring a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, and we have. But as the President met this week with the leaders of commercial laboratories, with the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, with leaders of other industries, the truth is: We’re bringing the whole-of-America approach to this and American businesses are stepping up in new and in renewed ways to make sure that we have the resources, including the testing and the development of therapies and, ultimately, in a year and a half, we hope, the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. And every American should be grateful for that.
With regard to the tests themselves, once again, CMS has already made the changes necessary that — that a coronavirus test is today now eligible for coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. And we’ll be working with these members of Congress to ensure that coronavirus testing is included as an essential health benefit and therefore is covered by all the private insurance in the country as well.
There may still be gaps. We’ll work with policymakers to ensure that the coronavirus is available for anyone who is concerned or suspected to have been exposed. But we’re making great progress in ensuring that this — that this test is available broadly to people across the country.
For up-to-date information on the status of the coronavirus, on best practices for preventing its spread, keeping your own health and your family’s health secure, you can go to coronavirus.gov for the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control.
Our message to families all across the state of Washington is simply this: We’re with you. We are here to help. And we’re going to stay with you every step of the way until the state of Washington and America sees our way through the coronavirus.
We are making progress. As I mentioned, federal assistance was approved by the United States Senate. President Trump is expected to sign the legislation tomorrow as he visits the CDC in Atlanta.
In that same spirit, I’m grateful to report that, on Air Force Two today, through the efforts of HHS, Governor, we’ve delivered 100,000 N95 respirators, over 100,000 surgical masks, more than 2,500 face shields, and thousands of disposable gowns and gloves to assist in making those resources available.
And also, we’re truly grateful that a leading research company made more than 200 doses of an experimental therapeutic medication available for people that are struggling and having severe difficulty with coronavirus. And we have a commitment that those medicines will continue to be made available on a daily basis.
With that, I’d like to introduce the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Bob Redfield, for the latest information and your best counsel to the people of the state of Washington.
DR. REDFIELD: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. First, what I would like to say is that I am really grateful to be here to express CDC’s appreciation for the dedication and efforts of the public health community and the people here in Washington as you begin to confront and continue to confront this outbreak.
I would also want to underscore what’s important to all the citizens of this state. I want them to have great confidence in the judgment and leadership of their governor and their health department.
Right now, the state of Washington is really — as the Vice President said, it’s the tip of the spear. And we are all here to commit CDC’s full support to assist you and work together to confront the challenges that this brings.
We implemented, at the beginning, very aggressive public health measures together to try to slow the spread in our country. You’re now at a stage where we’re beginning to see community transmission. And I just want to say, again, that it’s a privilege that we have, at CDC, to be able to partner with, really, the strongest public health system that we have in this nation, within the state of Washington.
We need to continue to be committed to the importance of early case recognition. And I want people to realize that when new cases are identified, that’s actually a success, not a failure. It shows that your public health community is out there doing their job with isolation and contact tracing.
And as we have one of the challenges to understand how do you really understand how to impact this virus for individuals that don’t actually have symptoms, I will argue one of the most important ways to do that is practice public health and do early case recognition, isolation, and contact tracing. It’s through the contact tracing that you’re going to begin to identify that group.
I also just want to finish by saying that we’re here, in partnership with your health department, to actually learn — because this state is now, as I said, the tip of the spear as we begin to reinforce those control measures that we just talked about for containment, but begin now to implement different mitigation strategies in the population.
And I’ll close by just re-echoing what the Vice President said: that the overall risk of coronavirus to the American public at this point is low. We’re here to work in partnership to help the state of Washington begin to effectively continue to address, as we confront, the community spread that’s here.
And again, I want the individual citizens of this state to recognize and have the confidence that they have, in my view, the best public health community in our nation to lead this effort.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Governor Inslee, as the President said, we’re all in this together. And I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to spend time with your team, to have the opportunity to spend time with Mayor Durkan, with King County officials, to hear a report from the ground.
We have — we have a ways to go, but I know we’ll get there together, and I know that we will — we will continue to build on this seamless partnership between the national government, your administration here in the state of Washington, and all the extraordinary health officials, healthcare providers, and first responders that, each and every day, in the weeks leading up to today, have been there for the people in this community.
As the President likes to say, this is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and we’ll continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to support your efforts in the Seattle area and across the state of Washington. And we’ll get through this together.
Thank you, Governor.
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Will you stand for some questions, Mr. Vice President?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Certainly.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-governor-inslee-press-briefing-tacoma-wa/

1221,Trump,2020-03-04 12:28:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force,Nan,"
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We just completed another meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  It’s been a very busy and productive day here at the White House.
President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and health of the American people.  And the President has directed our task force — employing the full resources of the federal government, in full partnership with state and local health authorities — to make that priority a reality.
As I stand before you today, we have more than 100 coronavirus cases in the United States.  That is counting domestic cases and cases of coronavirus of Americans that were returned from China or the Diamond Princess.  I’m pleased to report that most of those who contracted coronavirus within our care are continuing to recover.  But, sadly, we received word today that another American has passed away and their family has our deepest condolences.
That being said, thanks to the President’s strong leadership and the professionalism of all of our federal agencies — Health and Human Services, CDC — and state and local health officials all across this country, the risk to the American public of contracting the coronavirus remains low.
To be clear: If you are a healthy American, the risk of contracting the coronavirus remains low.  But it is still a good idea to engage in commonsense practices that are always recommended this time of year.  So, as someone who has a mother who is 87 years of age, and who has married kids living around the country, a brief tutorial on prevention for yourself, for your family, and your loved ones:
It’s a good idea to stay home when you’re sick.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue; throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently.  Wash your hands with either disinfectant or with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
And let me say again, as we’ve said before: There’s no need for Americans to buy masks.  And the commonsense practices that I just described are all available at CDC.gov.
Today, we — we had a series of meetings here at the White House and on Capitol Hill.  We met with executives of the airline industry, the executives of commercial labs, executives of nursing homes.  And our team also met with the Republican and Democrat caucuses in the House of Representatives.  And we were pleased to learn that, just shortly ago, the House of Representatives passed a federal funding bill by a virtually unanimous margin.  It’ll now move to the Senate.
And the legislation implements the President’s vision to ensure that not only do our federal agencies have the support and resources that they need, but also that our state and local partners have their support.  And in my conversations with governors all the way through this afternoon, I know they’re grateful for the bipartisan spirit that has characterized this funding bill and we’ll continue to work through that process.
As President Trump said, we’re all in this together.  And he deployed a whole-of-government approach, but, thanks to the President’s leadership, it has actually developed into a whole-of-America approach, and the meetings today with industry leaders is a reflection of that.
As Dr. Birx will — will indicate in just a few moments with some of the data that we’re evaluating from around the world, it does appear that the elderly are the most vulnerable and especially those serious health issues.
At the President’s direction, as a result, Seema Verma will describe that the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services has issued new guidelines for nursing homes nationwide.  We have raised the bar regarding infectious disease control in our nursing homes.
And in addition, Administrator Verma will explain how we are going to focus all of our inspection resources for the foreseeable future on compliance with infection control standards.
Generally, we — we monitor our nursing homes for abuse and neglect.  But at the President’s direction, we’re going to focus exclusively on ensuring that those who are in nursing homes — people operating the nursing homes, like many of the CEOs that we met with today — are complying with the new standards to keep our elderly safe.
The President also met today with airline executives and I’ll reiterate, as the President said, our profound gratitude to our partners in the airline industry.  They have worked with us in, as we say, flowing Americans through particular airports, the screening.  We’re working very closely with the airlines on contact information. If a person is tested as positive for the coronavirus, we’re working with the airlines to get all the information not just about that person, but about who they sat next to and who else was on the flight.  And the President and I are very grateful.
As we announced yesterday, I’m pleased to report that, as of yesterday morning, in addition to the travel ban from China — we’ve suspended all travel coming in from China, we’ve suspended all travel coming in from Iran, and even foreign nationals who visit either one of those countries are barred from coming into this country for 14 days.
We also established a travel advisory for Italy — portions of Italy and portions of South Korea over the weekend.  But even as importantly, as of yesterday morning, we fully implemented a screening process.  All direct flights from all airports in South Korea and Italy are now being subject to multiple screens before passengers board to come to the United States of America.
State Department worked very vigorously to bring that about and we’re grateful for the cooperation with the governments of Italy, the governments of South Korea, as well as our airline partners in making that a reality.
Finally, with regard to testing, we had a meeting today that gave us great hope for great progress in the near future on expanding testing across the country.  We have a ways to go yet, and I’m pleased to report, as we’ve been able to convey to state governments — governors around the country — is that, thanks to the good work with the FDA and Dr. Steve Hahn, who is with me here today, now all state laboratories, all university laboratories at the state level, can conduct coronavirus tests without any additional assets or resources from the federal government.  They have the FDA-approved tests; they can conduct the test all across the country in all the states.
Beyond that, as we announced, through the efforts of HHS, 2,500 kits of tests are going out this week that — 2,500 kits including tests has gone out this week.  That’s roughly 1.5 million tests that will be available this week.  We’ll continue to build on that number.
But perhaps most significantly, thanks to Dr. Birx’s efforts and leadership, we brought together, today at the White House, the leaders of all of the largest commercial laboratories in this country — companies like Quest that have vast capabilities, logistics and testing capabilities.  And we were pleased to report today that they have created a consortium to share information and to share resources and literally have told us that, as they go through what is called the “validation process” on testing that, by next week, individual companies will be able to do, as they said to me, thousands of tests of coronavirus if they are needed and required, and many, many multiples more of that in the not-distant future.
Our objective here, as Dr. Birx raised with the task force is we’ve got hospitals in affected areas and those that are requesting that have kits — we’ve got universities and state labs that now can perform the test on a requested basis.  But our objective, ultimately, and as quickly as possible, is to have tests made through these commercial laboratories and commercial providers that your local doctor, your CVS, your MedCheck is able to have a coronavirus test.  And that isn’t there yet; we’re working to make that a reality.
But again, it’s one more example — it’s not just a whole-of-government approach; it’s a whole-of-America approach.  And whether it be our nursing home industry, whether it be our airline industry, whether it be our commercial laboratories, I can speak on behalf of President Trump and our entire task force when I say we are profoundly grateful for the spirit that’s being reflected by companies all across the United States of America, grateful for the leadership at the state level.  And the American people should be confident that that spirit of partnership is going to continue to drive this at every level as we work our way through dealing with the coronavirus in the United States.
With that, I’m going to recognize Dr. Deborah Birx for her comments.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Good evening. Over the — over the last 12 hours, we’ve been able to receive information, both from South Korea and Italy, adding to our China information.  And it’s as we thought: The elderly and preexisting conditions have a more serious illness when confronted with the coronavirus.
Reassuringly, in South Korea, no one has died under 30.  This is reassuring to us.  And the median age in Italy was 81, of those who succumbed.  Those who became ill, the median age was 60.
So we find this data reassuring but it also has
has really caused us to focus on the Americans who might be most vulnerable.  So we’re focusing resources, attention, and all of our capacity to ensure those who have preexisting conditions and those who are elderly have access to the best prevention and treatment options.
The prevention options flow right through all of us to ensure that we have good protective hygiene for our elderly clients around the globe.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  And as you heard, because of the risk for our nation’s seniors, we are doubling down on our efforts.  Today, we put out three memos.  One was to hospitals about triaging and placement for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus.  We also put out some information to nursing homes about limiting visitors to nursing homes, monitoring staff.  And then, finally, we put out some information to our state surveyors that are going to be surveying our nation’s nursing homes and hospitals around infection control.
So all of that information went out this morning.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you, Seema.
CDC.  Bob Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I think what I’d like to highlight today is that — first, echo what the Vice President started with when he was giving the American people the advice that he did as he went through that we do have listed out on our CDC website: CDC.gov.
It really is very important, it’s very pragmatic about washing your hands 20 seconds in soap and water or using the other disinfectants.  Obviously, training yourself to
cover your sneeze or cough either in your elbow or with a Kleenex that you will dispose of.  These are very important things.  Working hard not to touch your face.
I think the most important thing for many of those individuals that might be a little type A: If you get sick, stay home.  You’re not helping your colleagues by going to work sick.
And again, I think these are just very pragmatic.  We’ve listed them.  They’re absolutely no different than what we ask the American public to do for the flu.
The second thing I would like to do is continue to get the help from you to get those messages out.  The one that’s the most important that the Vice President also talked about is the role of masks.  We need these N95 masks for the healthcare workers that are taking care of these patients.  We do not recommend them to be used by the general public.
And again, you all — if you tell the stories — are able to be great communicators of that, so that the American public gets accurate information and gets good guidance from your experts that you’ll reach out to for your stories.  So that’s what I would ask you to do.
And I’ll reiterate what the Vice President said at the beginning: that although we’re continuing to see new community cases in this nation, the overall risk to the American public at this time still remains low.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.
Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Just to reiterate what was said by several of our colleagues here is that we make policy recommendations and analysis of what we’re going to recommend based on accumulation of data.  Data is very important.  What Dr. Birx just told you is data is that underscores some of the things that we’ve been telling you.
You know, when you talk about risk — you know, risk is something that’s vague to people.  And we’ve said many a time, if you talk about risk of infection throughout the country, it’s a low risk.  If you talk about someone who is infected — and we do have infected people in this country.  You’ve heard that from Dr. Redfield.  You understand the situation that we have in Seattle.
If you do get infected, if you’re infected as — taking Seattle as the microcosm of that — it is exactly what Dr. Birx said: The risk of getting into difficulties is very heavily weighted towards people with underlying conditions and people with the elderly, where the young people — and there will be an exception here or there, the same way we see with influenza — but the risk for a young person who gets infected to getting into trouble is really low, based on a lot of data that’s coming out of foreign countries, particularly out of China.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Carson?
ADMINISTRATOR CARSON:  I want to thank the Vice President and the President for very aggressive and careful leadership.  Now, I was involved throughout my neurosurgical career with a lot of very, very complex cases and dealt with a lot of renowned physicians, but I must say the people on this task force are extremely impressive.  Have been considering all the various different possibilities — outlining scenarios for all the possibilities that can occur.  And it’s very comforting — and recognize that the risk to a healthy adult still remains quite low, largely because of the aggressive actions that have been taken and are continuing to be taken every day.
And just one last point and that is: The pharmaceuticals, who normally are rivals, have worked together voluntarily.  Wouldn’t that be a great lesson for the politicians?
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.
Quick informational announcement: I’ll be traveling with many members of the task force to Minnesota tomorrow.  We’ll be visiting 3M, which is poised to literally begin manufacturing millions more masks for our healthcare workers.  And then we’ll be traveling on to Washington State.
We’ll be meeting with Governor Inslee and with his health team to ensure that the full resources of the federal government are being brought to bear in support of their efforts to protect the health of the people across the Seattle area.
So, with that, let me start right here.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force-2/

1231,Trump,2020-03-03 12:57:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Vice President Pence and Members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force,Nan,"
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everybody.  We just completed today’s meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  As you know, the President spoke this morning to county officials.  And I want to remind everyone, as the President did today, that when it comes to health issues, state and local health authorities are in the lead, and the President reflected on that today.
The President also traveled with Dr. Fauci and the Secretary to the National Institute of Health and had a briefing there.  For our part, I was on Capitol Hill.  This team briefed the Republican Senate caucus, and we were invited to and briefed the Democrat Senate caucus.
Tomorrow we’ll be on the House side.  Our schedule is still firming up in the course of the day.  But we had the opportunity to have a fulsome discussion about policies, and not just limited to the supplemental but, very broadly, dealing with the issue of the coronavirus in the country.  And we were grateful for the opportunity to appear before both of those caucuses.
Let me give you just a couple of topline numbers.  At this point, we are at 77 domestic cases of coronavirus.  Sadly, Washington State confirmed three additional deaths today.  Our condolences go to the families of those that were lost.  That puts us at nine deaths, domestic.  And they were individuals at either in a nursing home or who had been critically ill.  And their families have our condolences.
We are at 13 states, plus New York City — 14 total jurisdictions at this point — where we have coronavirus cases currently operating.
I’ve had conversations today with the governor of Illinois and — as well as the governor of Washington State, and good and productive conversations.  And we’re extremely grateful for the leadership the governors across the country and their health departments are providing in this instance.
Today, a couple of decision points from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  Today, we will issue new guidance from the CDC that will make it clear that any American can be tested with no restrictions, subject to doctor’s orders.  Several governors said to me that there was an impression that the test would not be administered to people who were only mildly symptomatic.  We are issuing new guidance, effective immediately, from the CDC that will make it clear that any clinician on health authority can administer the test.
Testing was much a focal point of our efforts today.  Dr. Birx and the Secretary and I convened a conference call with CEOs of some of the nation’s leading commercial laboratories.  At this point, as the experts around me can describe, we are addressing the testing issue in a variety of ways.  CDC-approved tests are moving out.  We should have 2,500 kits out before the end of this week, which represents about 1.5 million tests.  Those are being focused on hospitals in the areas that have been affected, as well as hospitals that have requested those tests.
In addition to that, IDT is also spinning up their manufacturing for tests.  I am told that there’ll be up to a million a week by next week.  And in our meetings with the CEOs of commercial laboratories — and I’m going to have Dr. Birx speak to this — we will be meeting tomorrow, here at the White House, with those CEOs, to clear away any potential barriers to them leaning all the way in.
It was inspiring to be with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday who had already formed a consortium to begin to share resources and share information about meeting the need both with therapeutics and with the development of a vaccine.  And we’ll be challenging, as we did today, on the President’s behalf — we’ll be challenging the commercial laboratories in the country to spin up their capacity to collaborate and be able to process testing much more rapidly.
Seema Verma will elaborate for you, but tonight, the task force has authorized the decision that we’re going to put all inspection resources, at the state level, focused on infectious disease, looking at nursing homes being a focal point of vulnerability and a vulnerable population.  And Seema will clarify that with you, in addition to a variety of new sets of guidance that CMS is going to be issuing to nursing homes to really focus — focus our energy and our efforts on protecting the most vulnerable and where we see the locus of the coronavirus today.
Finally, we today — OMB will be issuing a new guidance.  We will be directing all federal government agencies to review internal travel policies and to adhere to State Department advisories with regard to international travel.
Let me say again that, as Dr. Fauci reiterated again today, the threat of the coronavirus to the American public remains low.  And as we continue to evaluate our circumstances, we’ll continue to bring recommendations to the President for changes.  But at this point, we’re simply directing a review of internal travel policies of all federal agencies and directing them to adhere to State Department advisories.
Before I introduce the Secretary, let me also say tomorrow we’ll be meeting with the CEOs of all the major airline carriers here.  The topic will be contact tracing data and how we can — we have a strong relationship in the 11 airports that have been assisting us with screening personnel coming back into the country — we call them “funneling airports” — but we’re going to be meeting with CEOs tomorrow to talk about even greater cooperation from them.
But again, I would just — I would just conclude by saying that tomorrow will be one week since the President asked me to lead the White House effort.  And I couldn’t be more proud or more impressed with the efforts at HHS, CDC, all of our agencies — NIH.  And I couldn’t be more proud to see the way states and local governments have had a seamless relationship with federal agencies in responding to this.  And that’s the relationship that we have forged.
We’ll continue to build on that, and we’ll continue to focus this week obviously on ensuring that, in the supplemental bill, we not only make sure that the federal agencies are properly funded, but as I’ve told 50 governors and 3 territorial governors, we’re going to make sure that state agencies and local healthcare providers also have the resources to be able to meet their needs without hesitation, to lean into this effort.  As the President said, this is all hands on deck.  We’re all in this together, and we’re going to continue to bring a whole-of-government approach.
With that, let me recognize the Secretary and then Dr. Birx, and we’ll each make some comments and take a few questions.  Okay?
Mr. Secretary?
SECRETARY AZAR:  Great.  Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.  And thank you all.  As the Vice President mentioned, and I’m sure we’ll all reiterate, at this time, the threat to any individual American remains low from the coronavirus.
As we’ve said, that can change rapidly.  We are watching for that constantly.  And, of course, with regard to any individual in contact with someone who is positive for the coronavirus, that risk is, of course, higher.
We’re working to keep that risk low.  We are aggressively deployed.  The CDC is out in the state of Washington, out in Santa Clara County in California, assisting with community mitigation steps, taking the lessons that we have both from our pandemic action plan, as well as from the Singapore and Hong Kong cases — what they’ve been able to do and some of the steps they’ve been able to get this situation more under control there.
I’m also very pleased to announce that the President of United States has donated his quarterly check to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health at HHS to fund the coronavirus preparedness and response activities.  So, very pleased to receive that check today.
We continue to make significant advances, in particular on removing barriers and moving forward in our response activities, basically using every day that we have gained by the President’s strong actions to take advantage of those days to advance the ball.
So, today, the President was up at NIAID, Dr. Fauci’s institute, where he was informed that, just yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the entry into clinical trial — phase one clinical trials of the vaccine candidate developed by NIAID scientists, who he got to meet today, and working with Moderna.  So, hopefully, within again five to six weeks, that will be in humans and phase one clinical trials as a result of the FDA clearance.
In addition, just last night, the FDA and CDC issued guidance with regard to these respirator masks, the N95 masks that you see that look more like cones on someone’s face — healthcare workers.  Something people don’t know is most of those N95 masks — the respirators, they’re called — in the United States are used in the construction trades and industrial trade.  So, construction workers, miners.
And yesterday, the FDA and CDC issued guidance under an emergency use authorization, making it clear that those industrial N95 masks are approved and appropriate for use by healthcare providers under the current exigent circumstances of the novel coronavirus.  That will free up a massive amount of additional supply in the marketplace for our healthcare providers, even as we engage in procurement activities under the supplemental that we hope to get to produce even more of those.
And then, finally, Dr. Hahn is going to be discussing with you some really important deregulatory work that we did.  We think it’s right-sizing regulation with regard to diagnostic testing that we did on Sunday morning that is unleashing massive capacity in the United States for lab developed testing.  So with that, let me stop.
Mr. Vice President, thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  And let me — and perhaps Dr. Fauci can amplify this in just a moment: The American people do not have to buy a mask.  The focus of our administration’s efforts in this area, as I talked to Governor Pritzker today in Illinois, is we have a — we have a reserve of some 43 million masks.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Masks overall.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’re working on — I’ll be traveling to 3M in Minnesota.  The supplemental will contemplate a contract with that company and Honeywell and others to produce masks.  And what we want to do is focus and make available the medical devices and protection for our healthcare workers.
And so, whatever you can do to get the word out to the American people that it is not necessary for the American people to buy masks in the midst of the coronavirus spread in the country.  The risk remains low.  And I’ll let the physicians describe that to you if there’s questions.
Let me introduce Dr. Birx for her comments.
DR. BIRX:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  So, yesterday, we talked about not only the vaccine development but the work ongoing in therapeutics, which will be available much earlier, as well as novel work on monoclonal antibodies.
For those of you who are in the audience who may be a little older, who used to get immunoglobulin before you traveled, it’s on that same principle.  It can be used both as a protective, as well as a therapeutic.  And so there’s work going on for that.
Today, we worked very hard and concentrated on the public — the private sector to really get them engaged in testing, because we know every family is concerned, particularly mixed-generation families and households where there’s both young children and the elderly that we know are at higher risk, potentially, for more sickness and actually more severe cases.
And so we know that the private sector is going to be critical in getting those assays immediately available in more the pediatric clinics, the CVSs, and so that anybody who wants a test can access tests.
Those are discussions we will have tomorrow and be able to really summarize on the movement towards making diagnostics more available, not only the nucleic acid diagnostics but the diagnostics that allow us to see who has been infected previously and really understand what the prevalence and incidence of this disease is — because it’s very difficult right now, when you’re only looking at the sickest, to really understand how broad infections may or may not be.
So we’re excited about that work that’s going to happen tomorrow.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Very good.  Thank you, Dr. Birx.
Seema?
ADMINISTRATOR VERMA:  Thank you.  As the Vice President said, we will be focusing all of our state agency resources that are involved in inspecting nursing homes and other healthcare facilities to focus on infection control practices.  Healthcare providers are going to play a very critical role in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and CMS has a unique role in holding healthcare providers accountable for maintaining these essential health and safety standards.
We’re also issuing a call to action to hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis providers, and all healthcare facilities to review their infection control and emergency preparedness procedures to ensure that they are in compliance with CMS regulatory requirements.
In addition, we are reissuing some guidance around infection control, around transfers between nursing homes and hospitals, encouraging and requiring them to consult with local healthcare officials.  And we’re also issuing some guidance around screening visitors and healthcare workers.
The third item that we’re releasing today is guidance to state inspectors who physically visit and evaluate healthcare facilities.  The guidance provides information on the latest CDC protocols that they must follow when inspecting these facilities with suspected cases of respiratory illness.  Inspectors should be coordinating with the CDC, CMS, and local healthcare officials.  And they should also make sure that they have the appropriate protective — personal protective equipment.
We’ve also deployed — CMS has deployed two of our infection control specialists to CDC in Atlanta so that we can remain in lockstep with the CDC as the situation evolves.  And this will allow us to coordinate our policies in real time.
And finally, CMS is preparing to send a team of inspectors to Washington State to inspect the nursing home, dialysis facility, and hospital that was involved in the recent COVID-19 cases so we can determine if all federal health and safety regulations were followed.
And we’ll be evaluating the situation daily and continue to provide updates.  Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Dr. Fauci?
DR. FAUCI:  I’ll just take a quick moment to just reiterate what was said about the visit to the NIH by the President.  And we were able to map out and discuss — and something that we want to make sure everyone understands: He saw it firsthand the process of vaccine development and why it’s very, very important that you do it in a stepwise fashion — even though we’re going more quickly than we’ve ever done that — and that is to go through a phase one trial to show that it is safe, and then even a phase two trial, which will take several months.
So if you’re looking at what’s going to be available, the one dictum that you always know in medicine is: First, do no harm.  And we’ve got to make sure that if we’re going to protect the American people, if we’re going to be giving them a vaccine to otherwise healthy people to protect them, we’ve got to make sure we have a vaccine that is safe and that is proven to be effective.  Not only just safe with any side effects, but there have been situations where even vaccines have actually made someone worse.  So we got to make sure that we don’t do that.
That’s the reason why, even though we’re going at rocket speed, it’s not going to be at least a year to a year and a half before we have a product that we would be able to confidently say let’s rev it up and give.  Not the case with therapeutics, because therapeutics — you’re giving it to someone who is already ill, and you’re trying to save their life.  That doesn’t mean you’re reckless with it; it means that you have almost an immediate answer as to whether it works.
So there are a couple of big trials that are going on in China, and there is one that’s going on right here in the United States, testing a single drug.  And there’ll be other drugs to do that, testing whether or not if you do “standard of care” versus “standard of care versus a drug,” whether or not that drug will actually be effective.
I was asked the question outside when we landed from the NIH, “When will that be?”  It will be when you get enough data, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board — which is a group that independently looks at the data to determine are you actually making things worse or are you making things better.  And they look at the data intimately.
Someone asked me, “Will that be two months, three months, five months?”  We don’t know.  It will be when the time comes when they look at the data, if — and this is a big “if” — don’t misinterpret it — if a drug is effective, then you would make it available to individuals.  Not guessing if it’s effective, but is it effective.
Thank you.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Hahn?
DR. HAHN:  Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to clarify some of the issues that have been in the press and concerns by the American people around the diagnostic testing.
So, first of all, this is a test that is not what we call a point-of-care test.  It’s not like the strep test, where you go in a doctor’s office and you get that test done.  This is a test where a swab is done and it’s sent to a laboratory, and in the laboratory they can perform that.
Currently, this test is available in state public health labs, based upon the great work that CDC has done to develop this test.  And the type of test is called a PCR test.  So CDC developed this test and has been distributing this to state public health laboratories.  And by current count, there are 46 state public health laboratories that have access to this test and can do this testing around the country.
So, additional tests are being performed by a company — or being developed — not developed, but being manufactured by a company called Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT.  They’re working with CDC to increase the capacity of the CDC-developed test.  They’re giving those tests to CDC to further disseminate to the public health laboratories.  They are also receiving orders from around the country — academic healthcare institutions, big hospitals, as well as commercial laboratories around the country — to further disseminate that test.
Their estimate is that, by the end of this week, they will be able to have shipped 1 million tests to these non-public health laboratories.  In subsequent weeks, they expect to escalate even further their manufacturing to higher numbers than that.  We don’t have estimates for that for you at this time.
But we expect that the shipment of those tests, the non-public health labs, will significantly increase the capacity around the country for testing.
On Saturday, you know we issued an emergency use authorization, which provided a deregulatory and — regulatory flexibility approach to what’s called LDTs, or laboratory developed tests.  That means X hospital in whatever state, whatever county, if they’re certified, can develop their own laboratory based test.  They notify us when that occurs, and then 15 days later provide us the validation data.
We use the same validation criteria.  These are experienced laboratories, and we’ve already heard from four laboratories around the country that they’ve developed these tests and have started using those tests.  So you can see this is a layered approach to increase our capacity.
And finally, FDA has been working with large commercial laboratories over the last three to four weeks, using our EUA approach, to help develop additional testing capacity.
And as the Vice President mentioned, we met with members today, over the phone, of large laboratories to actually discuss their expanded capacity and to further increase the availability of these tests for Americans.
So one last point: What can the average American expect in terms of availability of this test?  Well, first of all, as we mentioned, CDC will be issuing new guidance with respect to the fact that a physician should be able to order this test, based upon their own clinical assessment of that patient.
And, secondly, we expect that their access — Americans’ access to this test will increase as more and more laboratories around the country have availability of this test.  That should increase next week and further in the weeks ahead as more and more tests are available.  Thank you.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  I think what I would — I want to make a few points.  The first point I want to make is to recognize the, really, 24/7 work that the state and local, territorial, tribal health departments are doing.
They have — they’re at the front lines responding to this, implementing the principles that we’ve talked about before that are so important for this public health approach: early case identification, isolation of those individuals that are confirmed, and then aggressive contact tracing to try to identify additional cases.  And then it repeats to isolation contact tracing.
We’re going to continue to see new cases diagnosed in the community across this country.  But that really is a success, in my view, not a failure, of the incredible public health community that we have in these states and these local health departments, tribal and territorial.
I also would like to make a comment to the American people.  I want them to be prepared for the reality that there are going to be more cases in the community.  But I want them to continue their daily lives.  I want them to be mindful of the opportunity, again, to prepare themselves and their families as we see this.  As I mentioned I want these new cases to be viewed as a success, in one sense, of our effective public health community, and not a failure.
Finally, I just want to reemphasize what was said — one thing else that they can do.  These protective masks, they really are for healthcare professionals that are taking care of these individuals that are sick in the hospital.  We need all the American public to be part of — as the Vice President says, we’re all on the same team here.  And one of the most important components of that team is the American public.
And I want them to recognize: If we felt there was a public health reason for them to be going out to develop masks, those of us here — Tony and myself — would tell you.  But these masks are meant for the healthcare professionals that are at the frontlines trying to care these men and women that are quite sick.
And lastly, I just want to reemphasize once more what was set already by the Secretary and the Vice President.  Again, despite these new community cases, the risk at this time to the American public remains low.
Thank you very much.
THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  We’ll take a few questions.  Thanks.  Jim?  Go ahead.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-vice-president-pence-members-white-house-coronavirus-task-force/

1352,Trump,2020-01-31 10:42:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Members of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force,Nan,"
SECRETARY AZAR:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I’m Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Chairman of the President’s Task Force on the Novel Coronavirus.
I’m going to start by turning things over to Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to discuss the current situation on the novel coronavirus.  Dr. Redfield.
DR. REDFIELD:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Let me give you an update on the current situation of the novel coronavirus.  First though, I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public currently is low.  Our goal is do all we can do to keep it that way.
Second, I want to recognize the concern that the American public may have.  And I want to reiterate what I just said: Currently, the risk of the American public is low.
As of today, there are nearly 9,700 cases in China, with more than 200 deaths.  Additionally, currently there are another 23 countries that have confirmed, totally, 132 cases.  This also includes 12 individuals who have been confirmed in six countries who did not travel to China.
CDC has launched an aggressive public health response focused on early case recognition, isolation of those cases identified, and contact tracing around those individuals.  This response is a layered response, which includes both targeted airport screening, as well as heightened education and awareness of the American healthcare community to be vigilant in ascertaining the possibility of recent travel to China when they are evaluating patients with upper respiratory tract infection.
To date, we have confirmed six cases of this novel virus in the United States.  The most recent case had no travel history to China, but was a close personal contact of one of the previous cases that we had identified through our aggressive contact tracing.  In addition, there are currently 191 individuals that are under investigation.
Once again, I want to emphasize that this is a significant global situation, and it continues to evolve.  But I also want to emphasize again that the risk at this time to the American public is low.
Mr. Secretary.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Dr. Redfield.  I would now like to invite Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, to discuss the underlying rationale for the actions that I will be discussing after he concludes.  Dr. Fauci.
DR. FAUCI:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  The concept that’s underlying the action that you’ll hear about shortly is the issue of the unknown aspects of this particular outbreak.  So let me enumerate just a few of these.
I can start off by putting it into perspective by telling you I often get asked — we have an influenza outbreak here.  We have about 8,000 deaths already.  We have about 100,000 hospitalizations.  Why are we paying such attention?  And why are we doing the kinds of things we’re doing here right now?
Well, the reason is, despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there’s a certainty, for example, of seasonal flu.  I can tell you all, guaranteed, that as we get into March and April, the flu cases are going to go down.  You could predict pretty accurately what the range of the mortality is and the hospitalizations, as we’ve done over the years.
The issue now with this is that there’s a lot of unknowns. As you can see just from the media, the number of cases have steeply inclined each and every day.  You know that, in the beginning, we were not sure if there were asymptomatic infection, which would make it a much broader outbreak than what we’re seeing.  Now we know for sure that there are.
It was not clear whether an asymptomatic person could transmit it to someone while they were asymptomatic.  Now we know from a recent report from Germany that that is absolutely the case.
There are a number of countries outside of China that have travel-related cases.  And now what we’re seeing is that there are secondary cases from them, and, as Bob mentioned, we also have that in this country.  The WHO has issued, as you know, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declaration.
If you put all these things together, I underscore what Bob said: We still have a low risk to the American public, but we want to keep it at a low risk.  And because there are so many unknowns here, we’re going to take the action that the Secretary will describe, in a temporary way, to make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.  Thank you.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Dr. Fauci.  Today, President Trump took decisive action to minimize the risk of the spread of novel coronavirus in the United States.  Since taking office, President Trump has been clear: His top priority is the safety of the American people.  In addition to the steps that the doctors have outlined, we continue to operationalize a multi-layered, cross-agency, public health response.
Following the World Health Organization’s decision to declare the 2019 novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States.  The actions we have taken and continue to take complement — complement the work of China and the World Health Organization to contain the outbreak within China.
In accordance with the declaration, beginning at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time; Sunday, February the 2nd, the United States government will implement temporary measures to increase our abilities to detect and contain the coronavirus proactively and aggressively.  Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in Hubei Province in the previous 14 days will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine to ensure they are they are provided proper medical care and health screening.
To be clear, this applies only to U.S. citizens who have been in Hubei Province in the past 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the United States.
Any U.S. citizen returning to the United States who has been in the rest of Mainland China within the previous 14 days will undergo proactive entry health screening at a select number of ports of entry and up to 14 days of monitored self-quarantine to ensure they’ve not contracted the virus and do not pose a public health risk.
Additionally, the President has signed a presidential proclamation, using his authority pursuant to Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, temporarily suspending the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the 2019 novel coronavirus.
As a result, foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time.
Once again, these actions will become effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time; Sunday, February 2nd.  These prudent, targeted, and temporary actions will decrease the pressure on public health officials screening incoming travelers, expedite the processing of U.S. citizens and permanent residents returning from China, and ensure resources are focused on the health and safety of the American people.
I want to stress: The risk of infection for Americans remains low.  And with these and our previous actions, we are working to keep the risk low.  All agencies are working aggressively to monitor this continually evolving situation and to keep the public informed in a constantly transparent way.
The United States appreciates China’s efforts and coordination with public health officials across the globe, and continues to encourage the highest levels of transparency.
It is likely that we will continue to see more cases in the United States in the coming days and weeks, including some limited person-to-person transmission.  The American public can be assured the full weight of the U.S. government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people.
I’d now like to invite Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun for an update.
DEPUTY SECRETARY BEIGUN:  Good afternoon.  And thank you, Secretary Azar.  My name is Steve Biegun, and I am the Deputy Secretary of State, and I represent the State Department on the President’s Novel Coronavirus Task Force.
Let me describe briefly the role of the Department of State in the proceedings of this task force and our contributions.  Our first responsibility is to monitor events on the ground in China where we have the presence of U.S. diplomats, and to give clear and accurate advice to American citizens and, in particular, American travelers considering visiting or staying in China.
In this particular case, this includes identifying any health or safety risks to which they may be subjected, but also, very importantly, identifying their access to essential services such as healthcare in parts of China that are affected by this coronavirus.
China has an excellent healthcare system, but, in parts of the country, it is simply overwhelmed and the accessibility to that healthcare for any reason — including potential infection, but also any other type of accident in need of medical care — may be compromised during the Chinese government’s own treatment of the consequences of this virus.
Finally, we also make our judgments based upon any obstacles, particularly obstacles to movement that American citizens might face in the country.  And in China, we have seen barriers to travel, both within and without China, as well as between the United States and China.  And so we’ve given prudent advice, over the course of the week, to American citizens in order for them — to allow them to make the best possible choices for themselves.
Our second responsibility is to assist U.S. citizens in the affected areas as much as possible.  Because we have a presence on the ground, we can provide advice and, in some cases, we can make other arrangements.  But I want to emphasize this is “as possible,” and we will continue to review what we can do in certain circumstances.
Finally, and very importantly, the core mission of the Department of State is to work closely with our international partners.  And in this case, we are working very closely with the Chinese government in order to address a number of related matters.
But let me start, on behalf of the President and the Secretary of State, by extending our deepest compassion to the people of China.  This has been a very difficult time for the Chinese people.  It came at a point of their peak holiday season.  Many are affected.  Many have lost loved ones or are enduring the illness of loved ones.  And I want the Chinese people to know that they have the deepest sympathies of the United States of America.
Let me also say and echo what Secretary Azar said, which is we are deeply appreciative of the close cooperation we have with the Chinese government as we work together to try to find appropriate ways to address any risks and challenges from this virus.
And finally, the United States will continue to cooperate with China in ways that we could potentially provide assistance, including technical assistance, and also, to the extent possible, any critical supplies that the Chinese need in order to address this virus.  And we are working very hard to find donors and make arrangements so that we can — we can undertake a robust effort to help the Chinese people get their arms around this outbreak.
Thank you.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Secretary Biegun.  Let me — let me next invite the Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli to take the podium for some comments.
ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  I am Ken Cuccinelli.  I’m the Acting Deputy Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, and I’m the Department’s representative on the task force led by Secretary Azar.
Several elements of the Department of Homeland Security are engaged in implementing the medical strategy you heard described here, including Customs and Border Protection, which stands at our land ports, seaports, and airports — and I’ll come back to the airports in a moment — particularly the Office of Field Operations personnel who you see when you come back into the country from your travels.  They’re the first line of defense when you land and come to the country.
Additionally engaged is TSA — the security and the engagement with the airlines.  Our chief medical officer in the department is in CWMD and they’re — we were providing medical support at the airports.
So we’re using contract authority that we have to backfill the CDC personnel, so they can be freed up for other missions at the airports where medical screening is being focused.
FEMA continues to prepare and support HHS preparations themselves.  And then the United States Coast Guard, of course, commands the ports of the United States and deals with incoming shipping, which is obviously slower than the airplanes but coming nonetheless, and we are prepared to deal with each of those.
The President’s proclamation will have Customs and Border Protection ensuring that United States citizens, legal permanent residents, and their immediate families continue to enter the United States, though they — those coming from Hubei Province, as you heard from the Secretary, will be subject to quarantine and the others from China to screening.
We will be implementing a funneling effort at the airports.  This is done under the authority of the Customs and Border Protection, and it will include seven airports.  So starting five o’clock on Sunday, Eastern Time, incoming flights from China will be funneled through seven airports.  Those airports are JFK, Chicago’s O’Hare, in San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Honolulu, and LAX.
This is done under CBP’s authority.  It will be executed by the Secretary the Department of Homeland Security, consistent with the President’s proclamation and in support of that effort — again, so we can focus the expertise of the medical professionals that will do the screening to implement this.
We’ll continue to support the medical efforts across the country both at our ports — our land, sea, and air — as well as with personnel standing up some of the resiliency measures that HHS has been working on for some time.  Thank you.
SECRETARY AZAR:  Thank you, Secretary Cuccinelli.  At this point, we’d be happy to take some of your questions.  Kevin, would you like to get started?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-members-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/

1358,Trump,2020-01-30 05:15:00+00:00,"Press Briefing by Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway, ONDCP Director Jim Carroll, and Assistant Secretary of Public Health ADM Brett Giroir",Nan,"
MS. CONWAY:  Good morning.  Thank you for being here.  We come before you bearing good news.  For the first time in four years, life expectancy in the United States of America has increased.  And for the first time in 29 years, the number of drug overdose deaths has decreased.
This has not happened through coincidence.  It’s happened through causation.  It’s owing in large part to a whole-of-government approach to treat the whole person, led by President Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and really, the entire administration.
Nearly 70,000 of our fellow Americans died from an overdose last year, and 48,000 of those involved opioids.  About 70 percent of those deaths also involved some type of synthetic opioid, most prominently fentanyl, which could be an instant killer.  A couple of tiny grains are a lethal dose.
We’ve met with first responders, parents who have lost children, people in recovery, people who are running recovery centers.  We’ve met with mothers whose babies were born chemically dependent.  And we certainly have met with health professionals.  All of them have shared stories of loss but, increasingly, of courage and recovery.
This is a crisis that we call the “crisis next door,” because we want people to know, from the beginning, that the silence and stigma that it tends to — many people, it prevents them from seeking out the kind of treatment and help that is available to them is a very big priority for us — busting through that stigma and silence.
We also want to make clear, in this crisis next door, that it is indiscriminate.  It affects all races, socioeconomic status, gender, age, and certainly other affiliations.  If the crisis is indiscriminate, then the response must be indiscriminate.
And that’s why, in addition to everything that the President and the First Lady and the administration have done, I wanted to share with you, as a reflection, what I consider to be the most robust and significant bipartisan accomplishment of the President’s first term: H.R.6, the SUPPORT Act.  The President signed it into law following overwhelmingly unanimous support from every Democrat who voted for it in the House and the Senate.  This overwhelmingly bipartisan action has led to an increase in the money and awareness on the opioid and poly-drug crisis.
Features of the SUPPORT Act include the CRIB Act, where there is more money and more action for those neonatal abstinence syndrome babies that I mentioned before.  Medical professionals tell us it’s best to keep the mother — it’s best for the mother and it’s best for the baby to keep them together.  And, increasingly, that is happening.
Also, the nearly $3.7 billion in new grants put forth by the administration have made a real difference in our municipalities.  The STOP Act has helped us increase the number of seizures of fentanyl and other synthetic opiates coming through our mail.  It’s up to about 38 percent, and we have a goal, if not a mandate, of 100 percent.
Let me go through a couple of the numbers: 4.1 percent overdose death decline overall in our nation.  And that is the first time in 29 years — nearly three decades.  But in some of the hardest-hit states, we’re off a peak of over 20 percent: 19 percent in Pennsylvania, 22 percent decline over the peak high in Ohio, 11 percent in West Virginia, 14 percent in Minnesota, 7 percent in North Carolina — just to highlight a few of them.  Also, the Customs and Border Protection in the last fiscal year increased the seizures of fentanyl by 21 percent.
We also launched a targeted ad campaign geared at youth that was seen by over 1.4 billion views and over 58 percent.  In fact, the longer documentary type won an Emmy.
Naloxone prescriptions have increased over 400 percent.  Our Surgeon General, in April of 2018, issued the first advisory by a surgeon general in over a decade.  And Dr. Adams said at the time: We need to have naloxone more available to our first responders, to our health professionals, to our school systems, libraries, YMCAs and the rest, but also to each and every one of us.  The Surgeon General says, if each of us were to carry naloxone on our person, we too can be part of the solution, reversing these overdose deaths by administering this overdose-reversing medication.
Last night, Congress passed a 15-month extension of the current emergency scheduling of fentanyl analogues.  This is a critical tool for law enforcement because it allows them to continue to detect, analyze, and handle safely and effectively this very lethal drug.
In our effort to focus on prevention education, treatment and recovery, law enforcement interdiction, I’m also happy to report that we have record back-to-back-to-back-to-back collections on Take Back Day.  And I do want to credit our partners, like Google, who have been incredibly helpful to us in raising awareness and action among the public in understanding how to safely and broadly dispose of your unused, unneeded expired drugs.
In addition to Take Back Day, the prescriptions of high-dose opioids have fallen by over 32 percent since the President came into office.  If you need the pain medication, it will be there.  People are walking around with what’s left from a bottle of 30, 40 pills, and that’s where some of the peril begins.
In addition, we launched FindTreatment.gov — a completely overhauled tool for every American to access so that they can customize finding treatment for their needs.  You can customize it by age, by geography, whether you’re veteran, by LGBT, certainly by gender.  And this promotes quality over quantity.  When you type it in and you customize it, you can find treatment centers that are best for you.  Maybe you need to be there for a short amount of time.  Maybe you need to be there in-patient, out-patient.  Maybe you need to be there a longer amount of time.  You can customize that quite confidentially.
From 1999 to 2015, the government reported a 20 percent reduction in our workforce due to opioid and other drug abuse and addiction.  A 20 percent decline over 16 years.  I’m happy to report that because we’ve invested over $100 million in displaced worker grants across 17 states in the Cherokee Nation, those numbers are moving.
We are trying to treat the whole person, not just check in person.  We got you in drug court; we got you in drug treatment.  Isn’t that terrific.  It’s really terrific if we can them help them acquire employment, education, skills, training, and certainly housing, on the way to full recovery.
There is so much more work to be done.  We’re very pleased that the overdose deaths have declined, but 68,000 of our fellow Americans died last year from drug overdose.  That’s 68,000 too many.  If you look at the Super Bowl this coming Sunday, that number could be represented by every single seat with 3,000 left over at the Super Bowl this coming Sunday — just to give you the actual enormity of the problem.
We will continue to fight this every single day, and we will continue to make the investments of money, of time, of education.
And with that, I’d love to turn this over to Director Jim Carroll of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and then Admiral Giroir, the Assistant Secretary for Health of the United States of America.  Thank you very much.
Jim?
DIRECTOR CARROLL:  Thank you, Kellyanne.  A couple of years ago, when President Trump and I first talked about me taking the job as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and serving as his drug czar, he instructed me to be relentless in our efforts to save lives.  And that’s exactly what we’ve done to tackle this drug problem here in the United States.
The good news that we’re announcing today is a testament to the President and his leadership on this issue.  It’s an example of what can happen when we come together and apply that whole-of-government approach.
The obstacles we face could not be greater, but through our efforts on prevention, treatment and recovery, and reducing availability, we’ve made real progress for the American people — which we not only want to sustain, we want to accelerate.
Kellyanne discussed how we got here and what these numbers mean.  Admiral Giroir will discuss the incredible headway we’re making with getting people into treatment.
But I want to highlight the progress that we have made with our international partners and our law enforcement who are critical in reducing the supply of these dangerous drugs.
Back at the G20 Summit in 2018, President Trump raised the issue of fentanyl production with the head of China and demanded a solution.  He made it clear that the United States would not tolerate the flow of fentanyl and other deadly synthetic drugs coming into our country.
Because of this, in May 2019, China scheduled fentanyl and other similar analogues, such as controlled substances, which was a historic and significant event.
Last night, the House of the Representatives passed a 15-month extension on the ban in scheduling of fentanyl, but a long-term solution is still needed.
In September of 2019, I led a White House delegation to Beijing to ensure that China was keeping up with their commitment to President Trump.  The Chinese government agreed to improve the legal framework, agreed to improve their standards for prosecution for fentanyl-related trafficking, and established law enforcement methods there that were not heard of before.
In every meeting I had with the Chinese, my counterpart said they heard the President loud and clear: that the flow of fentanyl into the United States was not tolerated.  Since then, the Chinese officials have invited our U.S. counterparts back there to watch the first-ever prosecutions of Chinese nationals for trafficking drugs into the United States.
This progress, combined with President Trump’s commitment to secure our southwest border — which is critical to stopping the flow of drugs into our country — brings together several lines of effort that will serve to keep Americans safe from the dangers of illicit drugs.
A wall acts as a force multiplier for our Border Patrol agents, and is one of the many tools that we are using to counter drug traffickers.
Taking the steps towards the humanitarian crisis at our southern border has also been critical to keeping those drugs out of the country.  The more men and women we have in uniform, the more that we have on line, the more that are stopping these traffickers — the greater chance we have of saving lives.
The Department of Justice has played a critical role in this, as they have been cracking down in unprecedented numbers on drug traffickers.
Under President Trump, the DOJ has ramped up trafficking prosecutions — not only here domestically, but internationally.
Under this administration, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more kingpin designations against operators of distributors in foreign countries.
The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas that we fund out of the White House here — which provides assistance to federal, state, and local drug task forces — has received unprecedented funding from this administration, and that is beginning to show and is part of the paradigm shift that we’re seeing.
These HIDTA initiatives, for example, have dismantled 3,000 drug trafficking organizations, they’ve removed $16.5 billion of illicit drugs off our streets, and they have made nearly 99,000 arrests of drug traffickers.
In 2018, we even added, for the first time in 17 years, the first new HIDTA to make sure that we’re tackling this.
The men and women of law enforcement, whether they’re in uniform or not, are playing this vital role and putting their lives on the line every day.
What this shows is the President’s efforts are working and we are saving lives.
Before I turn this over to Admiral Giroir, I want to ask that when you’re reporting on this issue, that when you’re reporting on these numbers, that numbers are really just part of the story.  Behind each of these numbers is a person, is a child, is a mom, a dad, someone whose loss has left a great mourning in a family.
I was with three parents yesterday who had lost their child to an overdose.  Today, we remember Jason, Amber, and Eddie, and all of the other people that we have lost.  And we continue this fight in their honor to make sure that we fulfill the President’s commitment to save American lives.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to my friend, Admiral Giroir.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY GIROIR:  Thank you very much, Director Carroll.  Again, I’m Brett Giroir.  I’m the Assistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services.  I’m also Secretary Azar’s principal advisor on opioid policy, and I’ve been that for about two years.  And I’m honored to wear the uniform of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.
What we see today is no accident.  This is the result of an intentional whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to overuse — to over- — to opioid use disorders and other substance use disorders.
First of all, we recognize this as the public health emergency as it is.  And as such, we have focused on many different areas to yield these results.
First, as Kellyanne said, the number of opioids that have been produced — the total amount of opioids that have been prescribed since January 2017 is reduced by 30 percent nationally.  And we have been able to do that while preserving and expanding options for pain control for those who truly are in chronic pain or have debilitating injuries.
Secondly, we’ve approached this as a public health emergency, because addiction — opioid use disorder — is a chronic brain disease.  We have unprecedented numbers of individuals who are now receiving treatment.  Our estimates are over 1.3 million individuals are now on medication-assisted treatment, and they’re also getting the psycho-behavioral support and wrap-around services that they need.
You heard about naloxone — very, very important because everybody deserves a second chance at life.  You have the power.  I hope all of you in the media carry naloxone with you.  It’s very easy.  You can save a life, give a person a second chance.
This has resulted in, as you heard, a 4.1 percent decrease in the number of deaths and a 4.6 percent decrease in the actual overdose age-adjusted mortality rate.  Very important.
A couple comments on the overall longevity.  I have been shocked.  Everyone in the public health community has been shocked that over the three years, previously, our longevity has decreased.  That really means that our children and grandchildren will live less long and less quality of lives than we have.  This is shocking, and we have not seen this since the height of the AIDS epidemic in the ’90s.
This has been reversed.  We’re now on the trajectory of increasing years of longevity, and that’s associated with a number of things.  What does that mean?  It’s only one-tenth of a year, but that’s 25 million person years we just gained by this increase in longevity.  And the good news is the preliminary data from quarter one into quarter two of 2019 is our mortality rates continue to drop.
Now, I want to talk about all the Health and Human Services issues like treatment, like prevention, but I do want to mention the social determinants of health that are very important.
There was a nationwide study in December, published in JAMA, that highlighted what we all know: When an auto plant closes, opioid mortality rate among the young goes up 85 percent.  We have to keep our eye on those socioeconomic issues and everything that we’re doing to increase employment, increase opportunity.  These all directly affect the rates that we see and that we celebrate today.
And the final thing is, we are not taking our foot off the gas.  We understand that this is a dynamic issue — opioid use disorder, other use disorders — and it’s being fueled by transnational cartels.  So we are going to keep working together.  We work weekly, daily, together across the government to make sure we continue a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach.
MS. CONWAY:  Thank you.  Any questions?  Kristen?","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-senior-counselor-kellyanne-conway-ondcp-director-jim-carroll-assistant-secretary-public-health-adm-brett-giroir/

1420,Trump,2020-01-10 05:27:00+00:00,Press Briefing by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin on Iran Sanctions,Nan,"
SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Good morning, everybody.  Thank you for being here today.  I’d just like to make a brief comment before we talk about Iran sanctions.  I’m sure everybody saw that the DOW hit 29,000.  The President’s economic plans are clearly working.  We’re looking forward to the China signing, USMCA, and a very strong economy this year.
As previously announced by the President, we are announcing additional sanctions against the Iranian regime as a result of the attack on U.S. and allied troops.
First, the President is issuing an executive order authorizing the imposition of additional sanctions against any individual owning, operating, trading with, or assisting sectors of the Iranian economy, including construction, manufacturing, textiles, and mining.  And let me be clear: These will be both primary and secondary sanctions.  The EO also allows us to designate other sectors in the future as Secretary Pompeo and me think is appropriate.
Second, we are announcing 17 specific sanctions against Iran’s largest steel and iron manufacturers, three Seychelles-based entities, and a vessel involved in the transfer of products.  As a result of these actions, we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime, and we will continue our enforcement of other entities.
Third, we are taking action against eight senior Iranian officials who advanced the regime’s destabilizing activity and were involved in Tuesday’s ballistic missile strike.  Secretary Pompeo will comment more on this.
Today’s sanctions are part of our commitment to stop the Iranian regime’s global terrorist activities.  The President has been very clear: We will continue to apply economic sanctions until Iran stops its terrorist activities and commit that it will never have nuclear weapons.
I’ll now turn it over to Secretary Pompeo.
SECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Steven.  Good morning, everyone.
Today, President Trump is delivering on the pledge that he made the day after Iran attacked American forces in Iraq: There will be a series of new sanctions.
Secretary Mnuchin just mentioned eight senior Iranian officials that are responsible for the regime’s violence, both at home and abroad.  We’re striking at the heart of the Islamic Republic’s inner security apparatus.  These sanctions targets include the Secretary of the Supreme National Council and the Commander of the Basij Forces; that’s the regime’s brute squad, which has, in the last few months, killed approximately 1,500 Iranians who were simply demanding freedom.
Our action targets other senior leaders close to the Ayatollah.  They’ve carried out his terrorist plots in destabilizing campaigns across the Middle East and around the world.  They’ve employed soldiers across the region’s battlefields.  They’ve trained militias in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere in the arts of domestic repression.
Today, they’re accountable for murder and mayhem.  The goal of our campaign is to deny the regime the resources to conduct its destructive foreign policy.  We want Iran to simply behave like a normal nation.  We believe the sanctions that we impose today further that strategic objective.
Our campaign is composed of diplomatic, economic components that have deprived the regime of billions in revenue the regime has used to fuel death and destruction across the Middle East and all across the world.
Sadly, the previous administration had opened up revenue streams for Iran.  But under our administration, oil revenues are down by 80 percent and Iran cannot access roughly 90 percent of its foreign currency reserves.  And not even two weeks ago, President Rouhani of Iran admitted that our sanctions have cost Iran over $200 billion in lost foreign income and investment.  As long as Iran’s outlaw ways continue, we will continue to impose sanctions.
Finally, I want to reiterate President Trump’s concern for Americans and dual national citizens detained inside of Iran.  Iran knows these individuals have committed no crime.  They know the charges against them are fake.  And we will do all that we can to get each of them returned home safely to their families.
With that, we’ll take just a few questions.
Yes, ma’am.","https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-secretary-state-mike-pompeo-secretary-treasury-steven-mnuchin-iran-sanctions/
